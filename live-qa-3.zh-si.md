# Live Office Hours with Kevin Hale and Dalton Caldwell

Dalton: Hey how is it going, we’re going to get started. Yeah I'm Dalton I'm a  partner at Y Combinator and we’re going to be doing office hours today.

道尔顿：嘿，怎么样，我们要开始了。是的，我是道尔顿，我是Y Combinator的合伙人，我们今天要做办公时间。

Kevin: Yes.

凯文：是的。

Dalton: Yes.

道尔顿：是的。

Kevin: A couple of things to note, I know that a couple of live office hours  happen beforehand, we’re going to try to spend a little bit of time even after  these to talk with the different companies, 20 minutes for office hours is not a  normal time period that we'll do stuff. We’re going to try to do it as  fast as possible. Apologies in advance we might interrupt you just because we know how  short the time is to try to get as much information out of you for  us to communicate as well. All right thanks a lot. I think … How are  you doing?
Shruti: Good.

凯文：有几件事要注意，我知道几个现场办公时间会提前发生，我们会试着花点时间和不同的公司谈谈，20分钟的办公时间并不是我们要做的事情的正常时间。我们要尽可能快地做这件事。在此之前，我们可能会打断你，因为我们知道从你那里获取更多信息的时间是多么的短，以便我们也能进行交流。好的非常感谢。我觉得…你好吗？很好。

Kevin: Kevin.

凯文：凯文。

Shruti: Shruti
Dalton: Kerry, yeah.

史鲁蒂·道尔顿：克里，是的。

Kevin: Hi Shruti.

凯文：嗨，史鲁蒂。

Dalton: Dalton how is it going? I think you’ll need to use the mic right? Yes  the hand held mic.

道尔顿：道尔顿怎么样？我想你需要用麦克风对吧？是的手拿着麦克风。

Shruti: Cool.

真酷。

Kevin: Just very quickly introduce each of yourselves like your name your role with the company  and then name of the company and what you guys are doing?
Shruti: Yes I'm Shruti, we’re with HubHaus and this is-
Kerry: Kerry and I'm the CTO.

凯文：非常快地自我介绍一下，比如你的名字，你在公司的角色，然后是公司的名字，以及你们在做什么？是的，我是舒尔蒂，我们是哈伯豪斯的，这位是-凯瑞，我是首席技术官。

Shruti: I'm the CEO.

我是首席执行官。

Kevin: Then what does HubHaus do?
Shruti: HubHaus does co-living we provide co-living spaces for professionals. If you're new to the area  you’ve just gotten here and you want to rent a room out and a house  with a curated community and you wanted to be set up you can move into  one of our rooms.

凯文：那哈伯豪斯是做什么的？Shruti：Hubhaus是同居的，我们为专业人士提供共同居住的空间。如果你刚到这个地区，你想租一间房子和一间有策划社区的房子，你想要被安置，你可以搬到我们的房间里去。

Kevin: Then what does co-living exactly mean?
Shruti: Co-living means living with a group of people so basically shared housing.

凯文：那同居到底意味着什么？Shruti：同居意味着和一群人住在一起，基本上是共享的住房。

Kevin: How many people?
Shruti: Our houses are five to 10 people, some co-living spaces can range up to 30  but ours are 5 to 10.

凯文：有多少人？史鲁蒂：我们的房子有五到十人，有些同居空间可以达到30个，但我们的房子是5到10个。

Kevin: Then is the characteristic that you are sharing a bathroom with a bunch of other  people also kind of .

凯文：那就是你和一群人共用浴室的特点也差不多。

Shruti: Not necessarily some are, some don’t.

史鲁蒂：不一定有人是，有些人不是。

Kevin: Gotcha. Then how are things going for you guys so far?
Shruti: Pretty well, we launched 18 months ago, we are now at 220 tenancies across over  a dozen cities in the Bay Area and Los Angeles?
Kevin: What's the occupancy rate for this?
Shruti: We currently have occupancy rate of 94% most of the vacancy rate comes from our  launch vacancy. Our vacancy rate not including the first two weeks and the last two  weeks is about 2%.

凯文：明白了。到目前为止你们进展如何？很好，我们18个月前就开始了，我们现在海湾地区和洛杉矶的十几个城市中有220家租房？凯文：这个的入住率是多少？史鲁蒂：我们目前的入住率为94%，大部分的空置率来自我们的启动空置率。我们的空置率(不包括前两周和最后两周)约为2%。

Kevin: 2%, so when you say 94% like how many people does that mean in 220  properties?
Shruti: I'm sorry, so 220 tenants total.

凯文：2%，所以当你说94%的人喜欢，这意味着在220个房产中有多少人？对不起，总共有220个房客。

Kevin: Tenants?
Shruti: Yes.

租户？是的。

Kevin: Gotcha.

凯文：明白了。

Shruti: 220 that includes. That doesn’t … We have more rooms than 220.

史鲁蒂：220，包括。那不是…我们有超过220个房间。

Kerry: We have about 230 rooms.

克里：我们有大约230间房间。

Kevin: 230 rooms.

230个房间。

Dalton: In terms of the timeline when did you first start, like you say 18 months  ago but what did that look like, the very first tenant I guess?
Shruti: Yes so first thing is we got a house and I was actually … We  both still live in our HubHaus’ but I moved into our very first HubHaus. Then  we got a bunch of tenants and the first few houses was very much so  a learning process we were trying to figure out what works, what doesn’t and try  to create this backbone for our co-living spaces. Does that answer the question?
Kerry: It took about seven, I think it’s seven houses in the first three months.

道尔顿：就时间表而言，你第一次开始是什么时候，就像你18个月前说的，但是，我猜第一个房客是什么样子的？是的，所以第一件事是我们有一栋房子，而我实际上是…我们仍然住在我们的哈勃豪斯，但我搬进了我们的第一哈勃豪斯。然后我们有了一群房客，而最初的几栋房子是非常重要的，所以我们试图找出什么是可行的，什么是行不通的，并试图为我们共同居住的空间创造一个支柱。这能回答问题吗？凯丽：大概花了七次，我想头三个月是七栋房子。

Dalton: OK and so you guys take on the lease? What are the terms of the  lease that you take out? It’s just a standard one year lease then it goes  month to month?
Shruti: I see, yeah so we do one year to two year leases for each of  our house and we continue with one year to two year.

道尔顿：好吧，那么你们接受租约了吗？你签下的租约的条款是什么？这只是一个标准的一年租约，然后逐月进行？我明白了，所以我们每栋房子都要租赁一年到两年，我们还要继续一年到两年。

Dalton: Do you need any special permission from the actual owner of the property to do  this?
Shruti: Yes so we’re completely upfront with the owners, we let them know exactly what we’re  doing we sell it as a benefit; we act as a property advisor to the  owners. We guarantee them rent every month even if the house is completely vacant.

道尔顿：你需要财产的实际所有者的特别许可才能这样做吗？史鲁蒂：是的，所以我们对业主是完全正面的，我们让他们知道我们在做什么，我们把它作为一种好处来出售；我们作为业主的财产顾问。即使房子完全空置，我们也保证他们每月租房。

Kevin: Then what’s the margin that you get currently?
Shruti: 30 to 40%.

凯文：那你现在的边际是多少？史鲁蒂：30%到40%。

Kevin: 40%, so let’s just say, let’s take a typical property about like one house that  has how many rooms on average?
Shruti: Six.

凯文：40%，让我们说，让我们拿一个典型的财产，就像一个房子，平均有多少个房间？六。

Kevin: Six rooms and then how much are you paying rent on that house?
Shruti: Roughly $6,000.

凯文：六间房，那房子你要付多少租金？大约6，000美元。

Kevin: $6,000, okay. Then you guys will make 40% on top of that usually through renting  out.

6，000美元，好吗？然后你们就能赚到40%的钱，通常是通过租出去。

Dalton: If I'm property owner why is this a good deal? You said an advisor I  don’t really know what that means. Why am I like wow, please have a bunch  of people coming to my house and maybe it’s going to depreciate a lot.

道尔顿：如果我是业主，为什么这是一笔好买卖？你说的是个顾问我不知道那是什么意思。为什么我会像哇，请一群人来我的房子，也许它会贬值很多。

Shruti: Yeah so most of our property owners have pretty large properties, which are hard to  rent out. We’re able to quickly rent out a house, which maybe rents for like  $6,000 to like 8,000, $9,000. Instead of having to deal with a typical remote situation  where you have to deal with five like six or seven-
Dalton: But the landlord doesn’t care about that as long as they get paid.

是的，所以我们的大多数业主都有相当大的房产，很难租出去。我们很快就能租出一套房子，租金大概在6，000美元到8，000美元，9，000美元之间。不必处理典型的偏远地区的情况，你必须处理像六、七之类的五种情况-道尔顿：但只要他们拿到工资，房东就不关心这个问题。

Shruti: Exactly.

完全正确。

Dalton: This has been going on a while the landlords is like I don’t care as  long as the rent shows up whatever you guys are doing, not my problem.

道尔顿：这已经有一段时间了，房东们就好像我不在乎，只要租金出现在你们正在做的事情上，而不是我的问题上。

Shruti: Well so at the end at the end of the day as a landlord you  want one check, you want to make sure your house is taken care of and  you want professional people living there and you don’t want to have to deal with  it. We take care of all the hard stuff if there are any property problems,  which come up we advise them on what to do, but at the end of  the day all you're getting is one check and you don’t hear anything from us.

嗯，作为一个房东，你想要一张支票，你想确保你的房子被照顾，你想要专业的人住在那里，你不想去处理它。如果有任何财产问题，我们会处理好所有的难题，我们会建议他们该怎么做，但到了最后，你得到的只是一张支票，而你没有收到我们的任何消息。

Kevin: What's the rate of so how are things going right now? You said you are  doing pretty well but is revenue increasing monthly weekly?
Shruti: Yeah so over the … We just raised around and after we raised we’ve kind  of scaled back and we’ve been growing out our teeth.

凯文：现在的情况怎么样？你说你做得很好，但是收入每周都在增加吗？是的，所以在…上我们只是在周围长大，在我们长大之后，我们已经缩小了，我们已经长出了我们的牙齿。

Kevin: Why would you scale back?
Shruti: We wanted to hire a team and we wanted to make sure to our processes  were going well.

凯文：你为什么要缩小规模？史鲁蒂：我们想雇佣一个团队，我们希望确保我们的流程顺利进行。

Kerry: We were … Mic.

凯瑞：我们是…麦克。

Shruti: Sorry.

对不起。

Kerry: We were working about like 80 to 100 hour weeks each of us and we  were kind of reaching the limit of what we could do without team.

克里：我们每周工作大约80到100个小时，我们已经达到了没有团队的极限。

Kevin: Just think back so what is that rate of growth right now?
Shruti: About 8 to 10%.

凯文：回想一下，现在的增长率是多少？Shruti：大约8%到10%。

Kevin: 8 to 10% a month?
Shruti: Yeah and we’re growing … Before that we were doing about 15 to 20%.

凯文：一个月8%到10%？史鲁蒂：是的，我们在成长…在此之前，我们做了大约15%到20%。

Kevin: How fast are you adding on new properties is that pretty much your bottleneck, finding  supply?
Shruti: Right now our bottleneck is operations. We want to make sure that each of our  houses is launching smoothly and well. That’s what-
Kevin: Right now you don’t have the playbook for launching it? How many properties do you  have?
Shruti: We have 40 properties.

凯文：你增加新房产的速度有多快？这几乎是你的瓶颈，找到供应吗？现在我们的瓶颈是行动。我们希望确保我们的每所房子都能顺利启动。那是什么-凯文：现在你还没有启动它的剧本？你有多少房产？我们有40个房产。

Kevin: 40 properties and you feel like you still want … Why do you feel like  you don’t have the playbook after 40?
Shruti: I mean we definitely, we do have a playbook. We do have a step-by-step process  that we go through, but we've just gotten team on and we’re building out our  tech and training so that we’re able to scale sustainably and provide a fantastic experience  to each customer.

凯文：40个房产，你觉得你还想要…为什么你觉得40岁以后就没有剧本了？我是说，我们确实有一本剧本。我们确实有一个循序渐进的过程，但我们刚刚开始了团队建设，我们正在建立我们的技术和培训，以便我们能够持续地扩大规模，并为每个客户提供美妙的体验。

Dalton: When you say you want to build out a team to build tech and training  can you just dig into that a little bit? What do you need the team  to do?
Shruti: We now have a team, before until December I was the only full time person  working in December Kerry came on full time. Kerry was working as a co-founder before  that but he came on full time. Then we had one employee in December. The  past few months we hired on a property manager we hired on a person to  help out with partnership and we want a second developer to basically help us build  out the tech to automate a lot of these manual processes that we’re doing. Just  like responding to emails, responding to tenants with property management enquiries that come in, we  want to … There is ways to automate a lot of those steps.

道尔顿：当你说你想建立一个团队来建立技术和训练的时候，你能再深入一点吗？你需要团队做什么？史鲁蒂：我们现在有了一个团队，在12月之前，我是唯一一个在十二月全职工作的人，克里是全职工作的。在此之前，克里是一名联合创始人，但他是全职工作的。12月我们有一名员工。在过去的几个月里，我们雇佣了一个房地产经理，我们雇了一个人来帮助合作，我们想要第二个开发人员来帮助我们建立技术来自动化我们正在做的很多这些手工过程。就像回复电子邮件，回复有物业管理问题的租户一样，我们想要…。有很多方法可以实现这些步骤的自动化。

Kerry: We do look at ourselves like a market but it’s not a true market place  because we’re not connecting the landlord with the tenants, and so we do have the  supply and demand factors of it. We found that it tends to go back and  forth between them
Kevin: That doesn’t make any sense to me, I don’t understand that?
Kerry: Which part?
Kevin: It’s two parts so right. You are connecting them together. I don’t get why-
Kerry: The tenants never deal with the landlord specifically. We’re not connecting landlord with the tenants  we have to make the deal with the landlord themselves.

克里：我们把自己看作一个市场，但这不是一个真正的市场，因为我们没有把房东和租户联系起来，所以我们有市场的供求因素。凯文：这对我来说没有任何意义，我不明白吗？克里：哪一部分？凯文：有两部分是对的。你把它们连接在一起。我不明白为什么-克里：房客从来不专门和房东打交道。我们没有把房东和房客联系起来，我们必须和房东自己做交易。

Kevin: Right but it’s one ecosystem of supply and one ecosystem of demand and you are  bringing them together.

凯文：没错，但这是一个供应生态系统和一个需求生态系统，你要把它们结合在一起。

Kerry: That’s the way
Kevin: Regardless of how like the connections happen. It sort of works that way. What I'm  trying to figure out is how does this sort of win and the thing is  like do you feel like part of co-living is like this movement, people are realizing  I want to work and there is a lot, I'm not sure if I can  work with a bunch of other people. But the places where I want to work,  I take it you mostly are in the Bay Area, right.

凯瑞：这就是凯文：不管这种关系是怎样发生的。它是这样工作的。我想弄清楚的是，这种胜利是怎样的，而事情是，你是否觉得自己是同居的一部分，就像这样的运动，人们意识到我想要工作，还有很多，我不确定我是否能和一群人一起工作。但我想工作的地方，我想你主要是在海湾地区，对吧。

Shruti: Yes we’re in the Bay Area and LA.

是的，我们在湾区和洛杉矶。

Kevin: It’s really expensive to get place and so for the places that I'm trying to  get in there really quickly I might not have enough capital to move it. Co-living  is a way to step into that. I'm trying to think is like do you  have a reliable source of supply for people where there is like … Let’s say  this is a really big trend that you are going to be able to onboard.  What I'm trying to figure out is like, at one point do you feel like  you are ready to add on new properties and at what rate do you add  on properties?
Shruti: We’re picking up approximately four to six houses a month.

凯文：买房子真的很贵，所以对于我想尽快进入的地方来说，我可能没有足够的资金来搬迁。同居是一种方法。我想你有一个可靠的供应来源给像…这样的人吗？假设这是一个非常大的趋势，你将能够加入。我想弄清楚的是，在某一时刻，你觉得自己已经准备好加入新的属性了吗？以什么速度添加属性呢？史鲁蒂：我们每个月要买四到六间房子。

Kevin: Four to six a month.

凯文：一个月四到六次。

Shruti: Yeah.

是的。

Kevin: Okay and then how long are they vacant before … Like how long does it  take to get a house up and going?
Shruti: The time from when we sign a lease to the time the first person moves  in is about two weeks. The time from when we launch the house to when  it’s 100% full is another two weeks. About a month before it’s a completely up  and running HubHaus.

凯文：好的，那么在…之前，它们要空多久？比如要花多长时间才能买到一栋房子？史鲁蒂：从我们签租约到第一个人搬进来的时间大约是两周。从我们启动房子到100%满员的时间是另外两个星期。大约一个月前，它是一个完全建立和运行的哈哈斯。

Kevin: About a month.

凯文：大约一个月。

Dalton: We’ve seen a lot of people work on this idea and it seems like you  can get about as far as you have gotten, which is really great. But to  because you actually have take on the lease and because you have hard costs sometimes  these can look much more like a real estate business than a tech business. I  think what I kind of want to get at is are there ways that you  cannot hold the leases? Is there is a way you can make this much more  efficient from capital basis? Because right now this is basically a real estate business, right.  It sounds like there is some tech in there but I haven’t really gotten from  you that tech is like the differentiating factor that will make … It sounds like  it’s a lot of operations work to sign leases and then get people in units,  which is like pretty traditional residential housing type business. How are you thinking about what  let’s gets us huge? What are your thoughts along those lines?
Kerry: Part of that, so that is a good deal of tech I do agree that  it is not the key differentiating factor that we have. Some of it is different  and we automate a lot of the operations that are happening in front of this-
Dalton: What are those for like, hey the facet is broken can someone fix it and  you open a ticket is that what you mean? Can you tell me what that  means?
Kerry: More along the lines of automatically finding houses to go and see using some different  methods they are automatically posting. We have a constant in stream of probably about 100  tenants reaching out to us a day that’s being automated by tech. A lot of  the inter operations going between that is operated by tech. None of that’s very, some  of it’s unique, some of it’s not so much unique, I would say the bigger  differentiating factor, which we haven’t mentioned yet is the community fact that we build into  it, which is a lot of people come because it’s cheaper and because it’s a  place that they need quickly. We haven’t a very strong community element and create an  infrastructure in each house, so people are actually forming these really strong bonds.

道尔顿：我们已经看到很多人都在研究这个想法，似乎你能做到这一点，这真是太棒了。但是，因为你实际上已经承担了租赁，而且你的成本很高，有时这些看起来更像房地产企业，而不是科技企业。我想得到的是，你有办法不能持有租约吗？从资本基础上看，你有什么办法可以提高效率吗？因为现在这基本上是房地产生意，对吧。听起来好像里面有一些技术，但我还没有从你那里真正了解到，技术就像一个能使…变得与众不同的因素。听起来，签订租赁合同，然后让人们入住公寓，这是一项很大的运营工作，这就像一家非常传统的住宅型企业。你是怎么想让我们大赚一笔的？你的想法是什么？克里：这是其中的一部分，所以这是一项很好的技术，我同意这不是我们所拥有的关键的区别因素。其中有些是不同的，我们会自动处理在这之前发生的许多操作-道尔顿：那些是为了什么，嘿，小面坏了，有人能修好它吗？你打开一张票，这就是你的意思吗？你能告诉我那是什么意思吗？克里：更多的路线是自动找到房子，然后用一些不同的方法去查看，他们会自动张贴。我们每天都有大约100名租户与我们联系，这一天被技术人员自动化了。很多内部操作都是由技术人员操作的。这些都不是很独特的，有些不是很独特的，我想说更大的差异因素，我们还没有提到的是，我们建立了一个社区的事实，这是很多人来是因为它更便宜，因为这是一个他们需要的地方。我们没有一个非常强大的社区元素，在每个房子里都建立了一个基础设施，所以人们实际上正在形成这些非常强大的纽带。

Kevin: How do you make that happen?
Kerry: Part of that is we set up monthly dinners and we give them a format  of these are things you should go over and we throw events every month for  the entire community. We’re actually connecting these people and for that reason we’ve had a  continual growth. Well we start with month to month leases, we’ve moved up since then,  our average stay length has been a continual process upwards since the beginning and still  going.

凯文：你是怎么做到的？克里：部分原因是，我们安排了每月一次的晚宴，我们给他们提供了一种形式，这些都是你应该去做的事情，我们每个月都会为整个社区举办活动。我们实际上把这些人联系在一起，因此我们有了持续的增长。我们从一个月到一个月的租约开始，从那以后我们一直在上升，我们的平均停留时间从开始到现在都是一个不断上升的过程。

Kevin: Quite honestly I feel like this really down comes down to cost, like people want  to move into cities, in places where it’s highly desirable but property is like non-abundant  and they are trying to figure out how can I get to this in a  cost affordable. Co-living was a way to sort of make it happen. You can advertise  all this community stuff that you can tell the people, but it’s no different from  an apartment or a condo complexes, it’s like hey we have this community stuff we  have a pool room, we have these wealthy dinners or barbecues. It doesn’t sound any  different because no one says like, we don’t have a community here, we don’t do  anything nice for the people, make sure there is a bunch of shady people living  inside of it. You don’t sound any differentiated from it. All I can think is  like this is pretty much it’s either land grab, you have more great properties than  anyone else. Then on boarding feels so simple and easy. Basically it’s like someone contacts  on you on average, how long before they’re moved in? Is that a month?
Shruti: No so it’s I mean it’s as short as a week or two. But I  think the difference is the house is … Access to rooms isn’t easily accessible right  now. Access to rooms and single family homes with curated communities the only way you  can get access to these is through Craig Lists or by setting it up yourself.  We’re unlocking a whole new market, which is.

凯文：老实说，我觉得这真的是成本的问题，就像人们想搬到城市里去，在那些人们非常想要的地方，但是房地产就像不丰富的，他们正在努力弄清楚我怎样才能以负担得起的价格实现这一目标。同居是实现这一目标的一种方式。你可以宣传所有这些社区的东西，你可以告诉人们，但是这和公寓或共管公寓没有什么不同，就像我们有社区的东西，我们有游泳池，我们有这些富有的晚餐或烧烤。这听起来并没有什么不同，因为没有人说，我们这里没有社区，我们没有为人们做任何好事，确保有一群阴暗面的人住在里面。你听起来跟它没有任何区别。我所能想到的是，这几乎是一种掠夺土地的行为，你比其他任何人都拥有更多的财产。上船感觉很简单很容易。从根本上说，这就像一个人平均在你身上联系过，他们搬进来多久了？是一个月吗？不，所以我的意思是，它只有一两周的时间。但我觉得区别是房子是…现在要进入房间并不容易。进入房间和有策划人社区的单一家庭住宅，你可以通过克雷格列表或自己设置的方式访问这些社区。我们正在打开一个全新的市场。

Kevin: The whole thing is you build a brand to get people to trust you.

凯文：整件事就是你建立了一个品牌，让人们信任你。

Dalton: For people in the audience are Dead Houses still a thing, Rob Levitsky anybody Dead  Houses anyone lived in Dead House .

道尔顿：对于观众中的人来说，死屋仍然是一件事，罗布·莱维茨基-任何人都会死-住在死房子里的人。

Kevin: Yeah there is such a thing.

凯文：是的，有这样一件事。

Dalton: Okay cool. Okay clearly there is people that want to do this and okay sounds  like we have about five minutes left. What are the things that you are thinking  about that can make this as constructive as possible. Just to summarize sounds good you  are making money like good job what might be tough is what's the move to  make this huge now let me give you some options. Sometimes people that working on  the startup idea decide to actually buy the properties because then you can renovate them.  Then you actually own an asset and it becomes almost again like a real estate  business and I have seen, that’s kind of the WeWork model right, so I’ve seen  that happen. On the other hand you could try to make this as asset light  possible or maybe you're not taking the obligation of the leases, right. Then you can  grow really fast and somehow have a special deal with the landlords where you can  just like grow really fast and then your true market place because you are holding  any of the liability that right now you are holding. Or you can again maybe  you found the just right compromise between the two. This is sort of where I  would think about from the long term perspective, do you have thoughts around where you  see this going in a year or two?
Shruti: The latter is probably the direction we’re going to go, the reason why we haven’t  is just because it hasn’t really been a problem until now. But in the future  as it does become more a problem we do want to shift more of the  liability to the property owners.

道尔顿：好吧，酷。好吧，很明显，有些人想这么做，好吧，听起来我们还有五分钟的时间。你正在考虑的事情是什么，使之尽可能具有建设性。简单地说，听起来不错，你赚的钱就像好工作，可能很难做到，现在让我给你一些选择吧。有时候，那些致力于创业的人决定买下这些房产，因为这样你就可以重新装修它们了。然后你实际上拥有了一笔资产，它几乎又变成了一家房地产企业，我看到了，这是WeWork模式的正确之处，所以我看到了这种情况的发生。另一方面，你可以尝试使这成为可能的资产轻，或者你可能没有承担租约的义务，对吧。然后你可以非常快地成长，并以某种方式与房东有一个特殊的协议，在那里你可以像成长得非常快，然后你真正的市场位置，因为你持有任何你现在所持有的债务。或者你也可以，也许你在两者之间找到了正确的折衷方案。这是我从长远的角度来思考的问题，你对未来一两年的发展有什么看法吗？斯鲁蒂：后者可能是我们要走的方向，我们之所以没有这样做，仅仅是因为到目前为止，它还没有真正成为一个问题。但在未来，由于这确实成为一个更大的问题，我们确实希望将更多的责任转移到业主身上。

Dalton: Got it. One quick question while we’re on that, is there any insurance implications for  those? What kind of insurance do you have to take out?
Shruti: We do have a pretty comprehensive insurance policy to cover our properties if our tenants  do damage anything. Up to if the tenants burn down the house or something they  are recovered and then we are also asking our tenants to get renters insurance on  top of that.

道尔顿：明白了。在我们讨论这个问题的时候，有什么保险问题吗？你要买什么样的保险？史鲁蒂：如果我们的房客有任何损坏的话，我们确实有一份相当全面的保险单来覆盖我们的房产。直到房客烧毁了房子或其他东西，他们才被追回，然后我们也要求我们的房客在此基础上得到房客保险。

Kevin: If your problem right is like operations and you are recruiting trying to find people  like what is your pitch to people to get people on board to say like  come and do this startup because, it’s not many peoples dream to be like, I'm  going to work on basically the new form of like apartment complexes or dorms, basically  dorms for like millennials.

凯文：如果你的问题就像运营一样，你正在招募一些像你这样的人

Shruti: I mean so I think the biggest piece of our company is our community, each  of our house almost like a family like environment and people can really buy into  that. I mean I think a lot of people out here don’t really have access  to that and around universities sure some people have access to things like dead houses,  but most people out here move out here and lonely and don’t really know people.  Being able to offer this sense of community and the friendships that form from within  our community is the biggest pitch that we make.

我的意思是，我认为我们公司最大的一部分是我们的社区，我们的每一栋房子几乎都像一个像环境一样的家庭，人们真的可以买到它。我的意思是，我认为这里的很多人都无法接触到这些东西，而在大学周围，有些人确实可以接触到死房子之类的东西，但大多数人搬到这里来，很孤独，也不太了解人。能够提供这种社区感和来自我们社区内部的友谊是我们所做的最大的努力。

Dalton: You think that’s the long term difference, really you think it’s ultimately the community, I'm  just trying to make sure I understand. You are saying like look we’re going to  have the best community and the best brand for community and that’s what will attract  people. Again with this kind of business it’s very easy for new entrants to come  in. If we use the example Airbnb anyone can make an Airbnb clone but what  they actually have is network effects, where just like eBay it’s hard compete with eBay  because they have the buyers and sellers. What's the equivalent here; it is the community  is that what you are saying?
Kerry: It is branding, a lot of that we do have an because it is not  just community and the houses, we connect all of the houses to each other as  well. We do have a bit of a network effect there. I do think branding  is the defensibility part. The other key part that Shruti’s mentioned to me in the  past is most of the competitors can do one or two things well. Campus was  a previous company who did something very similar but they had very low motion on  it and they did the community aspect really well. People loved staying in them but  the operations was awful. Then there is other companies that do the operations very well  but many people have come to us and said everybody talks about community but you  are the only ones with it. We feel that what we have is different but  we are also good at operations. That’s the part that we are trying to scale  and trying to hire for tech to turn it more and more into a tech  business. To take all the lengthy processes that are taking operations like we’re hiring for  more engineers right now and making that as automated as possible so we can do  less of the actual the signing of the leases and the direct things there.

道尔顿：你认为这是长期差异，你真的认为最终是社区，我只是想确保我能理解。你是说，看，我们将拥有最好的社区和社区最好的品牌，这就是吸引人们的地方。同样，有了这种业务，新进入者很容易进入。如果我们以Airbnb为例，任何人都可以复制Airbnb，但实际上他们拥有的是网络效果，就像eBay一样，它与eBay竞争激烈，因为他们有买家和卖家。这里的意思是什么？这是社区，你是这么说的吗？克里：这是品牌，很多我们都有，因为不仅仅是社区和房屋，我们还把所有的房子连在一起。我们确实有一点网络效应。我确实认为品牌是防御性的一部分。史鲁蒂在过去对我说过的另一个关键部分是，大多数竞争对手都能做好一两件事。校园是一个以前的公司谁做了非常相似的事情，但他们有很低的运动，他们在社区方面做得很好。人们喜欢呆在里面，但手术很糟糕。还有其他公司做得很好，但很多人来找我们说，每个人都在谈论社区，但你是唯一有这种想法的公司。我们认为我们所拥有的是不同的，但我们也擅长操作。这是我们正在努力扩大规模的一部分，并试图雇佣技术人员，让它越来越多地变成一家高科技企业。采取所有漫长的过程，像我们现在正在雇佣更多的工程师，并使之尽可能自动化，这样我们就可以减少实际的签署租约和直接的事情。

Kevin: I think all the community stuff are good, it’s stuff for you to focus on  it will prevent churn from happening. But for the conversion, my feeling is your bottleneck  is probably still supply. Whatever it is you need to do is relieve yourselves on  what we want to take on properties. Because really what you have set up is  like your liability is that first month’s rent then you need to take on. Which  is pretty decent as far as capital If you can figure out how can I  turn around where like I sign a house, right then I could turn around, I  think you also have the part of safety like a security deposit also. It’s almost  two months worth of rent that you are taking on before you can have it  covered back. How long before you have that?
Shruti: It’s about a month, about a month.

凯文：我认为所有社区的东西都是好的，它是你关注的东西，它将防止搅动的发生。但是对于转换，我的感觉是你的瓶颈可能还在供应。不管你需要做什么，你都可以在我们想要的财产上放松自己。因为实际上，你所建立的就像你的责任，第一个月的租金，然后你需要承担。就资本而言，这是相当不错的-如果你能想出我怎么能像我签房子一样在哪里掉头，那么我就可以掉头了，我想你也有安全的部分，就像押金一样。你要付差不多两个月的房租才能还钱。你要多久才能拿到这个？大约一个月，大约一个月。

Kevin: It’s going to be about two, no it’s going to be about four months, before  you cover both of them, before you cover two months worth of rent.

凯文：大约两个月，不，大约四个月，在你支付两个月的房租之前。

Shruti: Well we collect back security deposits from our tenants.

史鲁蒂：嗯，我们从我们的房客那里收回押金。

Kevin: Okay, and then I think that’s all that it comes down, like you need to  figure out how to do all the community stuff up ahead of time. But everything  that allows you say like I want to take as many properties as possible and  figure out how to jump start them. Get people into the houses or homes very  quickly without losing quality. The whole thing is like what is that exactly book like  and you want to almost time yourself. It’s like okay we, out a property how  long did it used to take, what is our checklist that is very, very reliable  for us to determine if it’s valuable or not, go in there and figure that  out. That’s where part of that tech is going to be, seeing like how much  can we do online. Then the second part of it is going to be we  send someone down there they do a very quick assessment and we have the team  that quickly turns around the place take the pictures, puts the listing out there and  gets it out to people. That’s like the first step, supply. Then your demand is  just like being very proactive on getting the demand so that a lot of the  people tenants like you get like testimonials, you send it out to whatever universities wherever  people might be looking for housing and to make sure that they all think like  HubHaus is the first place I go if I consider moving to a new city.  It’s like I want HubHaus to be there because I know that a good …  Even if it’s a transitory it’s like I want to go there be there for  maybe one to two months and then maybe I’ll trans into something better. Or some  percentage will say like I just want to stay here because this is the kind  of community I want to be with. Imagine most people eventually graduate nobody want to  live in a co-living forever, some people might, but that’s actually I think the thing  I most worry about co-living kind of like co-working space. The thing I always get  nervous about in terms of brand erosion is that it’s not an easy way to  like churn people out. The thing is like in places where you go where great  people will graduate, what ends up being is like it slowly starts rotting with people  who like can’t leave. It’s like I don’t have anyone else that loves me and  therefore wants to live with me. It looks online farms, it like co-working space, it’s  just like people don’t want to be in those spaces anymore because it’s like oh  it’s all filled up with people who never left and they start to get grumpy  et cetera. This is like one of those places. What you want to really pay  attention is how do I figure that out, how do I make sure this stays  fresh, how do I make sure that people who might be creating that will not  poison the rest of the house?
Dalton: Yes to paraphrase these kinds of business churn kills you. The founders never realize that  they have high churn until like … You may be like oh we have really  good churn everyone ever says that and you don’t have enough data yet. But over  the long run sometimes things can creep up on you. If all of a sudden  you start to have high churn then you are on the hook for all these  leases. Like these can get tricky. This is a lot of the food delivery type  startups there is a whole class of things that don’t work, they are like we  have positive margins and we have low churn and we have great … They all  say the same things, but if you really dig into them the secret hiding in  their numbers that the founders don’t want to admit to themselves is that actually churn  can get you and if you have hard cost like warehouses not for you but  for other people. If you have all these hard costs and then you have some  down months, like you have to pay your rent every month you can’t get out  of it.

凯文：好吧，然后我想这就是最后的结果，就像你需要弄清楚如何提前做好社区的事情一样。但是所有允许你这样说的东西，就像我想得到尽可能多的属性，并想出如何跳起它们。让人们很快进入房屋或住宅，而不会失去质量。整件事就像什么是真正的书，你想要几乎自己的时间。就像好的，我们用了多久的时间，我们的清单是什么，对于我们来说，确定它是否有价值是非常、非常可靠的，我们进去看看，找出它的价值。这也是这项技术的一部分，就像我们可以在网上做多少事情一样。第二部分是我们会派人去做一个非常快速的评估，我们的团队会迅速地把照片转过来，把清单放出来，然后把它发给人们。这就像是第一步供应。然后，你的要求就像非常积极地获得需求，让很多像你这样的人-房客就像推荐信一样-把它送到任何大学，无论人们在哪里寻找住房，并确保他们都认为，如果我考虑搬到一个新的城市，哈勃豪斯是我首先要去的地方。就像我想要哈哈斯在那里因为我知道一个好的…即使是暂时的，我也想去那里待上一到两个月，然后也许我会转到更好的地方去。或者，有些人会说，我只是想留在这里，因为这是我想要的社区。想象一下，大多数人最终都毕业了，没有人想永远住在一种共同生活的环境中，有些人可能会这样想，但事实上，我认为这是我最担心的事情-共同生活-有点像共同工作的空间。从品牌侵蚀的角度来看，我总是感到紧张的是，这不是一种让人喜欢的简单方式。事情就像在你去的地方，伟大的人会毕业，结果是它慢慢地开始腐烂，与喜欢的人谁也不能离开。就好像我没有其他人爱我，所以想和我住在一起。它看起来像在线农场，就像合作的空间，就像人们不想再呆在那些空间里一样，因为这一切都充满了那些从未离开过的人，他们开始变得脾气暴躁等等。这里就像那种地方。你真正想要注意的是，我该如何解决这个问题，如何确保这件事保持新鲜，如何确保那些创造这种东西的人不会对房子的其他部分造成毒害？道尔顿：是的，可以这么说，这类的商业往来会害死你。创办人直到像…一样，才意识到他们有很高的流失率。你可能会说，哦，我们真的做得很好，每个人都这么说过，而且你还没有足够的数据。但从长远来看，有时事情会悄悄地出现在你身上。如果突然之间，你开始有很高的营业额，那么你就有了所有这些租约。就像这些会变得很棘手。这是很多食品配送型的初创公司他们都说了同样的话，但如果你真的深入到他们的数字中，创始人不想向自己承认的秘密是，事实上，流失可以得到你，如果你有很高的成本，比如仓库，不是给你的，而是给其他人的。如果你有这么多困难的费用，然后你有一些下降的几个月，就像你必须每月付你的房租，你无法摆脱它。

Kevin: If community is everything.

如果社区就是一切。

Dalton: Yeah.

道尔顿：是的。

Kevin: Then the tools you want to think about also are like the equivalent of what  you might see in like moderation tools. We have to build all this stuff to  work on communities at scale how does that work for like within homes and houses  like who do we have to empower within our community to make them sort of  work and carry things onward? Lots of great real live communities that have grown to  be really big they have to be really careful like how they sort of set  that up. There is going to be delicate balance between that you are actually going  through right now between like I need to achieve growth and revenue but also need  to make sure the community is taken care. The moment I think you chose this  way above this, then there is the sacrifice. Thing is you have to figure out  how do I get these work in a way that doesn’t break everything. Hopefully this  trend and this the other thing I always worry about is that this is a  trend that just might break over time. Just people, cities and governments are building enough  housing that basically people are able to find cheap housing on their own, they just  live by themselves.

凯文：那么你想要考虑的工具也就像你可能看到的类似于适度工具的工具。我们必须建造所有这些东西来大规模地在社区上工作很多伟大的，真正的生活社区已经发展成为真正的大，他们必须非常小心，就像他们的设置那样。在这两者之间将会有微妙的平衡，你现在实际上正在经历这两者之间的平衡，比如我需要实现增长和收入，但也需要确保社区得到照顾。当我认为你选择了这条路的时候，就有了牺牲。问题是，你必须弄清楚我怎样才能以一种不会破坏一切的方式来完成这些工作。希望这一趋势和我一直担心的另一件事是，这一趋势可能会随着时间的推移而破裂。只有人民、城市和政府正在建造足够的住房，基本上人们能够自己找到廉价的住房，他们只是自己生活。

Dalton: From your perspective what do you think the biggest risk is, what do you …  Is it you need a higher operations crew, you know what I'm saying? What do  you think is the … In the future let’s say it didn’t work and you  were like men it was this reason if you had to guess, what do you  think that is?
Shruti: We definitely do run a risk that if the market crashes rents could just crash  and we are locked one to two year leases, which is why we try to  restrict it to one to two year leases. I think that’s a big one, can  you think of others?
Kerry: Yeah I think I would agree that that’s the number one risk the other part  is not being able to continue to scale because operations costs are not able to  be automated in a valid way.

道尔顿：从你的角度来看，你认为最大的风险是什么，你…是什么？你需要更多的行动人员，你知道我在说什么吗？你认为…是什么在未来，假设它不起作用，你就像男人一样-如果你不得不猜测，你认为这是什么原因？Shruti：我们确实有风险，如果市场崩溃，租金可能会崩溃，而我们被锁定了一到两年的租约，这就是为什么我们试图将租金限制在一到两年的租约上。我觉得这是个大问题，你能想到其他人吗？克里：是的，我想我同意，这是第一大风险，另一部分是无法继续扩大规模，因为运营成本无法以有效的方式实现自动化。

Dalton: Yeah and like for your own edification I think a good thing to do would  be to amortize all of your costs for operations in your time when you are  calculating your margins. This is a classic thing people do it’s like we do food  delivery and we have positive margins, and it’s just a that they sell a burrito  for 10 bucks and it cost them seven bucks to make it. But if you  include delivery cost if you include support cost if you include returns like if you  actually bake in all this stuff they are definitely positive margins. I think in your  case just for your own edification try to back in some of these costs that  you have from an operations' basis.

道尔顿：是的，就像你自己的熏陶一样，我认为一个好的做法是，在计算利润的时候，摊销你所有的运营成本。这是人们做的一件经典的事情-就像我们运送食物一样-我们有着积极的利润，只是他们以10美元的价格卖了一份玉米煎饼，而制作它却花了他们7美元。但是，如果你把送货成本包括在内，如果你包括了支持成本，如果你包括回报，比如你在所有这些东西中实际烘焙，它们肯定是正利润。我认为，在你的情况下，只是为了你自己的熏陶，试着从一个运营的基础上收回这些成本中的一些。

Kevin: You have your 80 hours that you guys are burned out on.

凯文：你们有80小时的时间，而你们的时间已经被消耗殆尽了。

Dalton: Yes you got to put those into your margin calculation. That will just help you  know that you are actually building a great business versus you are just like leaving  out some of the costs in your margin calculation.

道尔顿：是的，你得把这些放进你的保证金计算中。这只会帮助你知道你实际上是在建立一家伟大的企业，而你就像在计算保证金时忽略了一些成本。

Kevin: We are out of time, thank you very much
Shruti: Thanks.

凯文：我们没时间了，谢谢你，史鲁蒂：谢谢。

Dalton: Thank you appreciate it, thank you.

道尔顿：谢谢，谢谢。

Kevin: Thank you.

凯文：谢谢。

Dalton: Thanks.

道尔顿：谢谢。

Shay: Hi?
Dalton: Hi how is it going?
Kevin: Hi.

嗨？道尔顿：嗨，怎么样？凯文：嗨。

Shay: Good how are you guys?
Dalton: Good, okay so what's your name?
Ash: My name is Ash.

谢伊：很好，你们好吗？道尔顿：很好，好吧，那你叫什么名字？阿什：我叫阿什。

Kevin: Hi Ash.

凯文：嗨，阿什。

Shay: Shay.

谢伊：谢伊。

Dalton: How is going?
Kevin: Hi Shay.

道尔顿：怎么样？凯文：嗨，谢伊。

Shay: Good nice to meet you. So we are Lambda Intelligence I'm CEO and we built  an API that allows developers to extract product information out of digitized receipts, so receipts  images and turns out there I huge volumes of data that’s locked up in these  receipts.

谢伊：很高兴见到你。所以我们是LambdaIntelligence-我是首席执行官-我们建立了一个API，允许开发者从数字化的收据中提取产品信息，所以收据图像和结果是大量的数据被锁在这些收据中。

Kevin: OK before you go into your back story, can you really quick so who is  the customer?
Ash: We’re actually selling to mobile app developers. We’ve got a mobile app developer who we  just signed a contract with they are our first customer but they are paying us  2,000 bucks a month right now for processing, basically product information out of receipt images.

凯文：好吧，在你开始讲你的故事之前，你能很快地说出谁是顾客吗？阿什：我们实际上是卖给移动应用程序开发人员的。我们有一个移动应用开发者，我们刚刚和他们签了合同，他们是我们的第一个客户，但是他们现在每月给我们2000美元的处理费用，基本上是从接收图像中获取产品信息。

Dalton: Okay so you guys offer an API to be able to take receipts and just  like give structured information back after that.

道尔顿：好吧，所以你们提供了一个API来接收收据，就像在那之后给出结构化的信息一样。

Shay: Exactly.

谢伊：没错。

Kerry: Yeah.

凯丽：是啊。

Dalton: Then can you give me one more use case why is this developer need this?
Ash: The core piece here is not just the OCR but it’s mapping the shortened product  descriptions and the prices to the actual product the full product name description brand all  of that type of structured information.

道尔顿：那你能再给我一个用例吗？为什么这个开发人员需要这个？阿什：这里的核心部分不仅仅是OCR，而是将缩短的产品描述和价格映射到实际产品、完整的产品名称描述、品牌、所有这类结构化信息。

Dalton: But what is there app to, so why would I want to download their app  what do I get to do with it?
Ash: They are a loyalty card vendor.

道尔顿：但是有什么应用呢，所以我为什么要下载他们的应用呢？我和它有什么关系？艾什：他们是一个忠诚度卡的销售商。

Shay: They are using this to better their app and better target themselves to their customer  so that’s why they need this product information.

Shay：他们用这个来改善他们的应用程序，更好地针对他们的客户，所以这就是为什么他们需要这些产品信息。

Dalton: I aways get nervous with API companies because basically API just like the bottom wrong  infrastructure for like software projects. They tend to want to be like commodities ultimately in  the end. The great API companies are going to be like okay if we’re going  figure out how to do this as cheaply as possible because this is going to  eventually going to become a commodity. Then like which ones are going after markets that  are super huge. That’s why I'm very interested in who the customer is, you are  like, mobile app developers that need to read receipts, how many of those are there  in the ecosystem.

道尔顿：我总是对API公司感到紧张，因为基本上API就像软件项目的底层错误的基础设施一样。他们最终倾向于像大宗商品一样。如果我们想出尽可能便宜的方法，伟大的API公司就会变得很好，因为这最终会成为一种商品。然后，就像那些在追逐超级巨大的市场一样。这就是为什么我非常感兴趣的客户，你是，移动应用程序开发人员，需要阅读收据，其中有多少在生态系统中。

Shay: That’s actually a good question. There are only 200 mobile app developers the second side  of the business that we are focusing on is that brands are really interested, deeply  interested in this type of data. We are in talks with one of the top  of brands with Craft and they’ve expressed interest in getting this type of data from  us.

谢伊：这其实是个好问题。只有200个移动应用开发者，我们关注的第二个方面是，品牌对这类数据非常感兴趣，非常感兴趣。我们正在与卡夫的顶级品牌之一进行谈判，他们表示有兴趣从我们那里获得这类数据。

Kevin: OK so your real customer is CPG companies.

凯文：好吧，你真正的客户是CPG公司。

Shay: Exactly.

谢伊：没错。

Kevin: OK, so you do have like a multi step process you are like are you  giving the API away for free?
Ash: No.

凯文：好吧，那么你确实有一个多步骤的过程，你是在免费分发API吗？艾什：不。

Shay: No.

谢伊：不。

Kevin: Why not just give it for free, if the real customer is giant CPG companies  why not just be like mobile developers we have a really great OCR receipt reading  thing, have at it and then because you have the best data collecting all that  information then you are able to actually close these enterprises.

凯文：为什么不免费提供呢？如果真正的客户是大型CPG公司-为什么不像移动开发商一样-我们有一个非常棒的OCR收据读取程序-然后因为你有最好的数据收集所有这些信息，那么你就可以关闭这些企业了。

Ash: That’s kind of our plan going forward; right now we’re able to get some revenue  off of just providing this OCR, API to our mobile app vendors. That’s kind of  our way of boot strapping.

阿什：这是我们未来的计划；现在我们能够从向我们的移动应用供应商提供这个OCR，API的过程中获得一些收入。这是我们系鞋带的一种方式。

Kevin: I think it would just slow you down. The thing is like how boot strapped  are you? Are you going to run out of money by now?
Ash: We are completely boot strapped right now.

凯文：我想这会让你慢下来。问题是你是怎么系鞋带的？你现在快没钱了吗？阿什：我们现在完全被绑住了。

Kevin: I see.

凯文：我明白了。

Shay: Yeah right now they are paying $2,000 per month for processing their receipts this is  on track to scale up to 15,000.

谢伊：是啊，现在他们每月要付2000美元来处理他们的收据-这是按部就班的，可达15000美元。

Dalton: Sorry just like you process the receipts, what are you … The product data but  why are they giving you, that’s like a lot of money for an app developer  to give you, why are they … What is the thing that they can’t build  themselves that you can build that’s like super useful to them?
Ash: The thing that we got is that we’ve build a bunch of scrapers and we’ve  got some partnerships in works.

道尔顿：对不起，就像你处理收据一样，你是什么…？产品数据，但为什么他们给你，这就像一个应用程序开发人员给你很多钱，为什么他们是…什么东西，他们不能建立自己，你可以建立，就像超级有用的他们？阿什：我们得到的是，我们建造了一堆铲运机，我们在工程中建立了一些合作伙伴关系。

Dalton: Are you scraping their email are you going to … What are you scraping exactly?
Ash: We’re scraping receipt images, people take-
Dalton: OK the user-
Shay: Like physical receipts.

道尔顿：你在刮他们的邮件吗？你要去…吗？你到底在刮什么？阿什：我们在刮收据图像，人们拿着-道尔顿：好的，用户-谢伊：就像实物收据。

Dalton: Photographs-
Ash: A receipt.

道尔顿：照片-灰：收据。

Dalton: A physical receipt.  Yes.

道尔顿：一张实物收据。是

Kerry: Yes.

克里：是的。

Dalton: Then the app developer calls your API with … Pass it like a GIF and  then you OCR it and you are like okay this I what this thing says.

道尔顿：然后应用开发者用…调用你的api。把它像GIF一样传递出去，然后你就像OCR一样，你就像好的，这是我这个东西说的。

Shay: Exactly.

谢伊：没错。

Ash: Yes then we structure it for them.

艾什：是的，那我们为他们安排一下。

Dalton: Okay.

道尔顿：好的。

Ash: So that it’s not just the receipts but the discounts.

艾什：所以不仅仅是收据，还有折扣。

Dalton: They need that to do loyalty. Okay so I'm just making sure I really understand  exactly what your API does okay.

道尔顿：他们需要这样才能做到忠诚。好的，所以我只想确定我真的很清楚你的API是怎么做的，好的。

Shay: Yes.

谢伊：是的。

Dalton: You get it?
Kevin: Yeah I do get it, it just makes me nervous because if your real customer  is a CPG what's your real business model. Like how much data do you need  to collect or Craft to say like we’ll even look at this. I know it’s  got to be a lot.

道尔顿：你明白吗？凯文：是的，我明白，这让我很紧张，因为如果你真正的客户是中央人民政府，你真正的商业模式是什么？比如，你需要收集多少数据，或者说，我们甚至要看这个。我知道一定有很多。

Ash: Yes, they want a million receipts a month.

艾什：是的，他们每月要一百万张收据。

Kevin: Got you. All the mobile app developers that potentially need this how much, is that  much … Because, I feel like the people who are mostly going to track receipts  are going to be people who are tracking expenses. But the only app I use  that I take a picture of my receipt, nothing consumer related do I do that.

凯文：抓住你了。所有可能需要这个的移动应用程序开发人员-有多少…？因为，我觉得大部分跟踪收据的人都是跟踪支出的人。但我唯一使用的应用程序是我的收据拍照，没有任何与消费者相关的东西我可以这样做。

Dalton: I mean there is loyalty stuff, but going along this line of thinking so if  your real customer is a CPG and this is sort of everyone can extrapolate from  this in the audience but maybe you should just be building the receipt tracking app  that does loyalty. It seems like you are trying to use this API thing as  like a shortcut and it’s going to be hard. But you are like whoa we  don’t really know how to get a million receipts, so let’s just build an APR  and like other people will get receipts. That kind of sounds like wishful thinking unless  … Again it’s great that you have this first customer so congrats on that. But  like to get a million receipts are they going to have a million receipts?
Ash: They are on tract … They want us to do about half a million receipts  right now. They are getting us close so we’ll need to work with a couple  of others.

道尔顿：我的意思是有忠诚度的东西，但是按照这样的思路，如果你真正的客户是中央人民政府，那么每个人都可以从中推断出观众的忠诚度，但也许你应该建立一个收据跟踪应用程序来实现忠诚度。似乎您正试图像使用快捷方式一样使用这个API，这将是很困难的。但是你就像哇，我们真的不知道如何获得一百万的收入，所以让我们建立一个APR，就像其他人会得到收据一样。这种想法听起来像是一厢情愿，除非…再次，这是很好的，你有第一个客户，所以祝贺你。但是，想要拿到一百万张收据，他们会有一百万张收据吗？艾什：它们在…上他们想让我们现在做大约50万张收据。他们把我们拉近了，所以我们需要和其他几个人一起工作。

Kevin: They are actually processing that many?
Ash: They are getting that many. That’s one of the reasons.

凯文：他们真的在处理那么多？艾什：他们得到了那么多。这就是原因之一。

Dalton: Then okay along this line of thinking like and they are cool with this right,  because sometimes what's tough with an API company is if you are doing something and  that it’s really straight forward how you’re monetizing it. You are kind of middle man  and eventually people like squeeze middle men. Maybe they are like hey, this is really  valuable, maybe the app that you are selling the API to also wants to sell  us the CPGs. You see the tension there?
Ash: Yeah.

道尔顿：好吧，沿着这样的思路，他们对这个观点很冷静，因为有时候API公司的困难之处在于，如果你在做某件事，而且你是如何将它货币化的，这是非常直截了当的。你是那种中间的人，最终人们喜欢挤中间的人。也许他们就像嘿，这真的很有价值，也许你卖API的应用程序也想卖给我们的CPG。你看到那里的紧张了吗？艾什：是啊。

Shay: Yeah we see that an actually we’ve done research and CPGs are buying lots of  data from third party companies like Oracle, Datalogix Experian they are spending millions of dollars  to get this type data. What's interesting is that this data is more aggregated in  nature that it’s mostly transactional. What we are getting at is like product level data  that we are focusing on which we know like brands really want.

谢伊：是啊，我们看到了，事实上我们已经做过研究，而且公司正在从第三方公司购买大量数据，比如甲骨文公司，Datalogix Experian公司，他们正在花费数百万美元来获取这类数据。有趣的是，这些数据在本质上是更聚合的，主要是事务性的。我们得到的是像产品级别的数据，我们正在关注，我们知道，就像品牌真正想要的那样。

Dalton: That makes sense but I think just from as scale perspective, like my understanding of  what data brokers want for ad targeting is like tens of millions of hundreds, like  the scale that you need to build a data business is much larger, like you  have seen anyone. Even with millions even for millions they give you the-
Kevin: The closest I have seen that people doing this is like they are offering companies  for free, so grocery stores, electronic stores retailers they see for free e-receipts. They say  like we offer this technology e-receipt is for free and then what they do is  they take all the data and what they have is it’s good for those customers  it’s good for the retailers because they are getting information they wouldn’t have otherwise about  their customer base. Then they resell the data as the CPG and like even like  bigger retailers. The whole thing is race to the data. It feels like I closed  this company they are doing half a million receipts okay maybe this is easier than  I think. Then like what's the barrier for you closing more people?
Ash: Right and I think that’s something that we’re actively trying to go after more of  these kind of data sources and so the more data sources that we can get  that obviously then proves the value of our.

道尔顿：这是有道理的，但我认为从规模的角度来看，就像我对数据经纪人想要的广告目标的理解一样，就像数以千万计的人，就像你所见过的任何人一样，建立数据业务所需的规模要大得多。即使几百万甚至数百万，他们也给了你-凯文：我所见过的最接近的是，人们这样做就像他们在免费提供公司，所以杂货店，电子商店，他们看到免费的电子收据。他们说，就像我们提供这种技术一样，电子收据是免费的，然后他们会拿走所有的数据，他们拥有的是对那些顾客有利的东西，这对零售商是有好处的，因为他们得到的信息，否则他们的客户群是不会有的。然后，他们将数据转售给中央人民政府，甚至像大型零售商一样。整件事就是和数据赛跑。感觉就像我关闭了这家公司，他们有50万张收据，好吧，也许这比我想的要容易。那你关更多人的障碍是什么？阿什：是的，我认为这是我们正在积极努力寻找更多的这类数据源，所以我们可以得到更多的数据源，很明显，然后证明了我们的价值。

Dalton: Yeah.

道尔顿：是的。

Kevin: How is that going? You said there is like 200 so have you emailed all  200?
Ash: We’ve emailed about 100 of them so far.

凯文：怎么样？你说有200人，所以你把所有200封邮件都发出去了吗？阿什：到目前为止，我们已经给他们发了大约100封电子邮件。

Kevin: What have you learned?
Shay: We’ve learned, our response rate has been about 25% so far and we’ve learned that  the current mobile app lender that’s providing us this data like them others are also  interested and they are willing to show that data because they are experiencing similar problems.  They have all of these-
Kevin: You had 25 people respond to you why are they not customers that’s actually the  question I'm interested in.

凯文：你学到了什么？谢伊：我们已经了解到，到目前为止，我们的回复率大约是25%。我们了解到，目前向我们提供这些数据的移动应用程序贷款人也很感兴趣，他们愿意展示这些数据，因为他们遇到了类似的问题。他们都有-凯文：你有25个人对你做出回应，为什么他们不是顾客-这实际上是我感兴趣的问题。

Ash: We actually only launched our private data with this mobile app lender about a week  and a half go so we’re still super early on this. We’ve got a list  of meetings next week. One of the reasons why they are not customers yet is  because our sales cycle is a little bit I think probably at least a month  or two.

阿什：我们实际上只向这个移动应用程序贷款人发布了我们的私人数据，大约一周半的时间，所以我们仍然非常早。我们有下周会议的清单。他们还不是顾客的原因之一是因为我们的销售周期有点小，我认为可能至少有一两个月。

Kevin: It’s still pretty good.

凯文：还是挺不错的。

Shay: Yeah.

谢伊：是的。

Ash: Yeah.

艾什：是啊。

Kevin: But I mean these aren’t really enterprise prices that you are charging?
Ash: Right.

凯文：但我的意思是，这些并不是真正的企业价格，你是在收取吗？艾什：对。

Kevin: Okay I think for an API like the biggest thing is like any API is  like you have such a long cycle because you got to meet with like, you  want to see you have to someone actually try the thing, are people going to  be invested. Is it meeting at the right time right? It’s like the time that’s  developing the app and need to work on the future is that the time they  sort of need your product or service. It’s really a matter of you need all  cylinders going up once to have as many of those people try, because you don’t  know at what point and then all of a sudden there is a proper nexus  of the sale that actually close, or the usage to actually happen. When you talk  to like Craft how much were they willing to pay?
Ash: They were looking at 20 cents a receipt.

凯文：好吧，我想对于一个API来说，最大的事情就是像任何一个API一样，你有一个很长的周期，因为你必须遇到这样的人，你想看到你必须有人去尝试这个东西，人们会被投资吗？会议时间对吗？这就像开发应用程序和未来需要的时间是他们需要你的产品或服务的时间。这真的是一个问题，你需要所有的气瓶升一次，让这些人中的许多人尝试，因为你不知道在什么时候，然后突然之间有一个适当的关系，真正关闭，或实际发生的使用。当你和“喜欢手工艺”交谈时，他们愿意付多少钱？艾什：他们看的是一张20美分的收据。

Kevin: 20 cents a receipts for a million receipts?
Shay: Yeah.

凯文：一百万张收据一张20美分？谢伊：是的。

Ash: Yeah.

艾什：是啊。

Kevin: Okay fascinating.

凯文：好的，很吸引人。

Dalton: One thing this is just like a general purpose piece of advice is like when  you are dealing with large corporates they employ lots of people in the business development  role and their job is to meet with people and to find innovative stuff all  the time. For every deal that they actually do and for every contract they execute,  they probably meet with a 100 startups. We meet with a lot of startups all  the time that have similar things where from their side of the table you just  ask for something crazy like go get a million receipts and then we’ll look at  it and maybe we’ll pay. You know I doubt they are saying that in writing,  right. Did they send you a contract?
Ash: No.

道尔顿：有一件事，这就像一个通用的建议，就像当你和大公司打交道时，他们雇佣了很多人从事商业发展工作，他们的工作就是随时与人见面，寻找创新的东西。对于他们实际做的每一笔交易和他们执行的每一份合同，他们可能会遇到100家初创公司。我们经常遇到很多创业公司，他们有着相似的东西，从他们那一边的桌子上，你只需要一些疯狂的东西，比如去拿一百万张收据，然后我们再看一看，也许我们会付钱。你知道我怀疑他们是以书面形式说的，对吧。他们给你发合同了吗？艾什：不。

Dalton: OK well so you can give people these impossible tasks just like for fun and  see if they come back with it. Even if they do come back with it,  that doesn’t necessarily mean they are going to do the deal with you. We’re always  talking to startups that they believe the best case scenarios it’s so good to be  optimistic so I get why, but they believe the best case scenario the you know  hey this huge Fortune 500 company is going to do a deal with my two  person startup and they are going to give us a million dollars. Men just not  really. Like usually to pattern match here usually you have to stare stuff up and  you start with smaller customers that say yes more quickly and it’s for smaller dollar  amounts. You have to do that for quite a while before you are able to  get one of these deals. Sometime people call then silver bullet deals. It’s the deal  that makes your startup where you go from zero revenue to a million; somehow the  universe makes those very, those things rarely happen. I think in your case one negotiation  tactic here maybe is to be like hey we don’t have a million receipts but  why don’t we start with a pilot we do have whatever.

道尔顿：好吧，所以你可以给人们这些不可能完成的任务，就像好玩一样，看看他们是否会带回来。即使他们回来了，这也不一定意味着他们会和你做交易。我们总是跟初创公司说，他们相信最好的情况-乐观是很好的，所以我明白为什么，但是他们相信最好的情况-你知道，这家财富500强公司将和我的两个人的创业公司做一笔交易，他们会给我们一百万美元。只是男人不是真的。就像通常模式匹配在这里，通常你必须盯着东西，你开始与较小的客户说是更快，这是为了更小的美元金额。你必须这样做很长一段时间后，你才能得到这些交易之一。有时人们称之为银弹交易。正是这笔交易让你的创业公司从零收入变成了一百万；不知怎么的，宇宙让这些事情很少发生。我想在你的情况下，这里的谈判策略可能是，嘿，我们没有一百万的收据，但为什么我们不从飞行员开始，我们有什么。

Kevin: Half a million.

凯文：50万。

Dalton: How about that let’s start with that and let’s just get this going and let’s  do our first data drop and let’s get this on paper. What you can do  when you negotiate with these kinds of people is to try to like if they  are saying come back with this really hard thing, and then maybe I’ll say yes,  move them down to something you can do, something that’s more minor. Then try to  get it in writing and once you get something in writing, it’s so much more  likely they’ll do the deal because talk is cheap is. Like anyone could say, oh  we’ll give you a million dollars if you do whatever. To get someone that works  at a corporation to put something in paper they will either come up with an  excuse why they can’t, or they are actually serious. Think about how much better that  would be for you as founders if you had something in writing, because then you  know this is real and that can give you so much more confidence that you  are going down the right direction. That’s always something I always suggest, this goes for  everybody where you‘re dealing with these big organization is try to get anything in writing.  You have five minutes.

道尔顿：让我们从这个开始，让我们做我们的第一次数据删除，让我们把它写在纸上。当你和这些人谈判的时候，你能做的就是试着喜欢他们说的话-带着这个很难的东西回来，然后我也许会说是的，把他们移到你能做的事情上，一些更小的事情。然后试着把它写下来，一旦你在书面上得到了一些东西，他们很有可能会这么做，因为谈话很便宜。就像任何人都能说的，哦，如果你做任何事，我们会给你一百万美元。要想让在公司工作的人把某件事写在纸上，他们要么会想出一个借口来解释他们做不到，要么他们是认真的。想一想，如果你有书面的东西，这对你作为创始人会有多大的好处，因为你知道这是真实的，这会给你更多的信心，让你朝着正确的方向前进。这一直是我一直建议的，这适用于你与这些大组织打交道的每一个人，那就是试着得到任何书面的东西。你还有五分钟。

Kevin: The thing I don’t like about this kind of code is inefficient. Like one you  working on like commodity level, data processing, is being set up and then you have  to do one thing before you can do the other thing all right. It’s a  two step process and so there is so many additional risks. To me it’s always  like I'm trying to get this other thing, how do I make that go really  fast to prove out this sort of nature. That’s why my first instinct is like  just make this free. If your mobile developers really want this and everything comes down  to you having as much data as possible and you make sure that you get  as much data as possible, as quickly as possible. That means like giving it, doing  it and doing it at a scale that other people won’t be able to sort  of compete. I firmly believe like down the line this technology for OCR processing for  receipts and stuff that’s going to be fairly common.

凯文：我不喜欢这种代码的地方是低效的。就像你在商品级别上工作，数据处理，正在建立，然后你必须做一件事，然后你可以做另一件事，好吧。这是一个两步的过程，所以还有很多额外的风险。对我来说，我总是想要得到另一种东西，我怎样才能很快地证明这种本性。这就是为什么我的第一反应就是让这个自由。如果您的移动开发人员真的希望这样做，那么所有的事情都取决于您拥有尽可能多的数据，并且确保尽可能快地获得尽可能多的数据。这意味着，就像付出，去做，在其他人无法竞争的规模上去做。我坚信，就像这条线一样，这种用于OCR处理收据和其他东西的技术将会相当普遍。

Dalton: Maybe this is a dumb question but is there a reason why like Expensify and  all the receipt tracking things aren’t just doing this. Like why can’t the CPGs get  access to all these other receipt tracking data things?
Ash: I mean what we’ve seen so far is that a lot of the accuracy levels  in receipts is still pretty low.

道尔顿：也许这是个愚蠢的问题，但是为什么像Expensify和所有的收据跟踪工具都不只是这样做呢？比如为什么PG不能访问所有其他的收据跟踪数据？艾什：我是说，到目前为止，我们看到的是，收据中的许多准确性水平仍然很低。

Dalton: Interesting.

道尔顿：有意思。

Ash: Like especially because you can get the direct OCR that’s pretty good at this point.  But it’s going from that OCR kind of piece to an NLP piece that a  lot of companies either really-
Dalton: Do you actually need to skew is that what you are-
Ash: Yeah.

阿什：特别是因为你可以得到直接的OCR，在这一点上是相当不错的。但是从OCR到NLP，很多公司或者真的-道尔顿：你真的需要扭曲你是什么吗-阿什：是的。

Dalton: Is that they can get pricing data but they don’t have the actual skew to  map it back.

道尔顿：他们可以得到价格数据，但他们没有实际的倾斜来映射回来。

Ash: Exactly because that’s exactly what it is.

艾什：正是因为这正是它的本质。

Dalton: OK.

道尔顿：好的。

Ash: I mean it’s one of those things like this is a problem that I actually  solved and when I was co-founder at a healthcare company. We had lab forts that  we actually had to match to individual SNOMED lab codes. I did that there and  we were able to do it for 40 million patients.

阿什：我的意思是，这是我真正解决的问题之一，当时我还是一家医疗保健公司的联合创始人。我们有实验室堡垒，实际上我们必须与SNOMED实验室代码相匹配。我在那里这样做了，我们为4000万病人做了这件事。

Dalton: That’s great so here is something to think about when you are this stage, it’s  like you think about what are my strengths what are the things that we can  do really well that no one else can do and what are the area where  we’re on the same level playing field with everybody else. I feel like what I'm  getting from this conversation is that a lot of your strengths is in this technology.

道尔顿：那太好了，所以当你在这个舞台上的时候，这里有一些值得思考的事情，就像你在想我的优点，我们能做得很好的事情，其他人都做不到的事情，以及我们和其他人在一个公平竞争环境中的领域。我觉得我从这次谈话中得到的是，你的很多优势都在这个技术上。

Ash: Yeah.

艾什：是啊。

Dalton: It is in the fact you can build this amazing OCR and it sounds like  you’ve been trying to find what the best possible market is. By doing a bunch  a of customer conversations you ended up saying, hey you know what CPGs have money  and we can use this technology, we already know we’re good at. I would think  of your core strength is be in the technology. Now on the CPG side until  you have your first thing in writing that’s still in the question mark. It’s not  not a strength but you don’t, it’s not like in the bag, in the way  that, it sounds like you have this technology and it works today right?
Ash: Yeah.

道尔顿：这是事实，你可以建立这个惊人的OCR，这听起来，它听起来，你一直在努力寻找什么是最好的市场。通过做大量的客户对话，你最终会说，嘿，你知道CPG有什么钱，我们可以使用这种技术，我们已经知道我们很擅长。我认为你的核心力量在于科技。在中央人民政府方面，直到你第一件书面的事情还在问号上。这不是一种力量，但你没有，它不像在袋子里，在方式上，它听起来就像你有这种技术，它今天起作用了吗？艾什：是啊。

Dalton: That’s in the bag like you can take that to the bank. I would think  about thinking about what your strengths are and then maybe being open minded to how  you monetize it. It could be until you get this right, until you lock in  this risk that this may not the best possible market for this technology.

道尔顿：那是包里的东西，你可以把它拿到银行去。我会想一想，你的优势是什么，然后也许是开放的思想，你如何赚钱。这可能是直到你得到正确的，直到你锁定这种风险，这可能不是最好的市场，为这项技术。

Kevin: They call it being promiscuous.

凯文：他们称之为滥交。

Dalton: Be open minded to ways you can use this. Other people maybe like hey you  don’t need a million receipts we’ll give you money today for this other like semi  related. It could be really close to what you are doing or it could be  a little further away we don’t know but you have something really special and you  have how long ago did you talk to Craft?
Ash: We talked to Craft about three weeks ago.

道尔顿：对你可以使用这个的方法持开放的态度。其他人，比如，嘿，你不需要一百万张收据，我们今天会给你钱买另一张，就像半相关的。它可能真的很接近你正在做的事情，或者它可能是更远一点，我们不知道，但你有一些非常特别的东西，你有多久前，你与克拉夫特？阿什：我们三个星期前和克拉夫特谈过了。

Kevin: Great. Then is the deal closed with the half a million?
Shay: No we are in relative early conversations but they’ve-
Dalton: With Craft.

凯文：太好了。那么，这笔交易是否与50万美元交易结束了？谢伊：不，我们的谈话还比较早，但他们已经-道尔顿：和克拉夫特。

Shay: With Craft that’s with Craft.

谢伊：有工艺，就有工艺。

Kevin: I got you. Make the deal close with the app developer.

凯文：我抓住你了。与应用程序开发人员达成协议。

Shay: Yes the deal is closed with the app developer.

谢伊：是的，这笔交易已经和应用开发者达成了。

Kevin: Do you actually have data for half a million receipts?
Shay: Yes.

凯文：你真的有50万张收据的数据吗？谢伊：是的。

Dalton: That’s awesome.

道尔顿：太棒了。

Kevin: OK you should go immediately back to Craft is like we currently have-
Dalton: Let’s do a pilot.

凯文：好的，你应该马上回到克拉夫特，就像我们现在的情况一样-道尔顿：让我们做个飞行员吧。

Kevin: Half a million-
Dalton: Just work with them.

凯文：50万-道尔顿：和他们一起工作。

Kevin: Would you be interested in doing like a pilot, sign a letter of intent say  like start looking at the data we provided to you, you guys can check to  see if like is this what you are looking for, because that will help you  know that you are delivering something on time. Then like have them sign a letter  of … Letter of intent all that’s going to say is just going to say  okay. Then if we, you are going to initially look at this data and tell,  we’ll work back and forth to see is this what you are looking for. This  is the going to be format you want. Then when we have a million receipts,  we’ll start talking about pricing.

凯文：你是否有兴趣像一个飞行员那样做，签一份意向书，比如开始查看我们提供给你们的数据，你们可以检查一下，看看这是不是你想要的，因为这将帮助你知道你正在按时交付一些东西。然后让他们签一封…的信意向书要说的都是好的。如果我们，你首先要看这些数据，然后告诉我们，我们会来回工作，看看你要找的是什么。这是你想要的格式。当我们有一百万张收据时，我们就开始讨论定价问题。

Dalton: Because like if you can just put numbers on this I would say when a  startup says we’re in discussions with a customer the close rate on that is like  10%.

道尔顿：因为就像你能把数字放在上面一样，我会说，当一家初创公司说我们在和一位客户讨论时，收盘率大概是10%。

Kevin: I discount the zero and even-
Dalton: Let’s just say 10, between 0 and 10%, it’s very low. Versus if you get  an LOI then I’d discount that to like 50% maybe even 60.

凯文：我把零和偶数折算了-道尔顿：假设是10，在0到10%之间，很低。与之相比，如果你得到一杯饮料，我会给你打50%的折扣，甚至60%的折扣。

Kevin: 25%.

凯文：25%。

Dalton: What's that’s? 25, all right.

道尔顿：那是什么？25，好吧。

Kevin: A 25.

凯文：25分。

Dalton: I guess I'm more optimistic than Kevin here. Then once you have a signed contract  then obviously it’s 100%. We from our side of the table we’ve seen so many  people that are in discussions with all these great signing deals and we’re like well  can you get it in writing, then they go try to get it in writing  they are like no. That’s such a good test at this stage and it doesn’t  cost you anything.

道尔顿：我想我比凯文更乐观。那么，一旦你签了合同，显然是100%。我们在谈判桌上看到了这么多人，他们正在讨论这些伟大的签约协议，我们就像你能以书面形式得到它，然后他们试着用书面方式得到它-它们都是否定的。这是一个很好的测试，在这个阶段，它不需要花费任何费用。

Shay: Absolutely.

谢伊：当然。

Kevin: The other piece of advice is everything Dalton talked about in terms of like what  you have in the bank in term of what you are good at, another way  of thinking about it is that like that is default for your business. The default  is the technology of the OCR it has to work, and has better than anything  else. You have to do these other thing usually at a startup that is going  to actually determine whether you will grow and be really successful, and that is going  be sales. That is the part that you have to work 10X harder on. This  thing that you are not very good at you actually have to spend ironically a  lot more time on it to make your company better. Yes for the sales you  are going to talk to all the rest of those mobile developers. Try to get  them all in discussion and close them to get the deal. But also you’ve got  Craft going on but also you should talk to as many other CPG companies also  well to see if is there a market beyond these guys. Is it similar sort  of pricing, what do I need to understand, what needs to be delivered because I  actually basing everything that I'm going to give the CPG companies on what Craft has  said. It’s really like by the end it’s like the next like two months it  should be like you have talked to and figured out how to talk to all  the other mobile developers and you have talked to like 50 other CPG companies at  the very least. That almost all your time, it’s almost no programing or coding. It’s  just developing the language for like do I understand what is the process for closing  these deals, which is actually going to make me money we’re out of time, guys  thank you so much.

凯文：另一条建议是道尔顿谈论的每一件事，就像你在银行里所拥有的一样-你擅长什么，另一种思考方式是，就像你的企业违约一样。默认的是OCR的技术，它必须工作，并且比其他任何技术都要好。你必须做其他的事情-通常是在一家初创公司，这将决定你是否会成长并取得真正的成功，这就是销售。这是你必须努力10倍的部分。这件你不擅长的事情，你实际上不得不花更多的时间在它上，以使你的公司更好。是的，为了销售，你将和所有其他的移动开发人员交谈。试着让他们都参与讨论，然后完成他们的交易。但是，你也有手工艺，但你也应该和其他的CPG公司谈一谈，看看这些人以外是否还有市场。这是类似的定价吗，我需要理解什么，需要交付什么，因为实际上，我要给中央人民政府的所有东西都是基于Craft所说的。就像到了最后，就像下一个月，应该像你已经和所有其他的移动开发人员谈过，想出了如何交谈的方法，你至少已经和其他50家CPG公司谈过了。几乎所有的时间，它几乎没有编程或编码。它只是在发展一种语言，比如我是否理解完成这些交易的过程，这实际上会让我赚到钱-我们没时间了，伙计们，非常感谢你们。

Dalton: Thank you so much.

道尔顿：非常感谢。

Shay: Thank you.

谢伊：谢谢。

Ash: Thanks.

阿什：谢谢。

Dalton: Thanks appreciate it, thank you.

道尔顿：谢谢，谢谢。

Kevin: Thank you.

凯文：谢谢。

Dalton: Hey how is it going? I'm Dalton.

道尔顿：嘿，怎么样？我是道尔顿。

Kevin: Hi I’m Kevin.

凯文：嗨，我是凯文。

Speaker 7: Hi.

演讲者7：嗨。

Kevin: Hi.

凯文：嗨。

Speaker 7: Cool so we are working on Commaful a place where people share and read short  stories. We’ve found a new format that’s a little bit like a picture book. There  is a little of text on each page then there is a background image that  relates to the text and you tap through to flip through the pages of the  story. People share anything from poetry fiction as well random blog posts about what they  are doing in their daily lives. Currently we get about 100,000 monthly unique and mostly  teenagers currently using this site.

演讲者7：酷，所以我们正在共济会，一个人们分享和阅读短篇故事的地方。我们发现了一种新的格式，有点像图画书。每一页都有一点文字，然后有一个背景图像，与文本相关，你可以点击，翻阅故事的页面。人们分享诗歌、小说以及随意的博客文章，分享他们在日常生活中所做的事情。目前，我们得到了每月约100，000独特，并主要是青少年，目前使用这个网站。

Kevin: How many stories are been created?
Speaker 7: 20,000 have been created total about 1,500 a month.

凯文：创造了多少故事？演讲者7：20，000人，每月总共约1，500人。

Dalton: Let’s say I'm of your active users, what format do I consume this in is  this a mobile app is this a website?
Speaker 7: Right now it’s all mobile web.

道尔顿：假设我是你们的活跃用户，我用什么格式消费这个-这是一个移动应用，这是一个网站吗？演讲者7：现在都是移动网络。

Dalton: Okay 100% mobile web?
Speaker 7: Yes.

道尔顿：好的，100%的移动网络？发言者7：是的。

Dalton: What's the breakdown of what devices they’re on?
Speaker 7: It’s about half and half an IOS and Android.

道尔顿：他们用的是什么设备的故障？扬声器7：大约一半是iOS和Android。

Speaker 8: 60, 40.

演讲者8：60，40。

Dalton: OK and then what's the geo location of those folks what country are they in?
Speaker 8: It really leans toward IOS in American and the rest of the world are Android  so it’s still 60, 40.

道尔顿：好吧，那这些人的地理位置是什么？他们在哪个国家？扬声器8：它真的倾向于iOS在美国和世界其他地方是Android，所以它仍然是60，40。

Dalton: Okay so 60% IOS U.S.

道尔顿：好的，60%的iOS美国。

Speaker 7: Yes.

发言者7：是的。

Dalton: Then what are the countries that are non-U.S. Out of the U.S.?
Speaker 7: Philippines is a pretty popular one.

道尔顿：那美国以外的国家是什么？演讲者7：菲律宾是一个很受欢迎的国家。

Speaker 8: U.K. And India.

演讲者8：英国和印度。

Speaker 7: U.K.

演讲者7：英国。

Kevin: U.K. India.

凯文：英国，印度。

Dalton: Then what would be breakdown say of the Philippines on that one, like 10, 20%.

道尔顿：那么菲律宾在这一问题上会有什么问题呢，比如10%，20%。

Speaker 7: It’s like 15%.

演讲者7：大概是15%。

Dalton: 15 okay.

道尔顿：15，好的。

Kevin: Who are your most popular storyteller?
Speaker 7: So there is a girl in LA and she basically writes like kind of fourth  wall fiction stories and she already had an audience before joining Commaful, she brought a  good chunk of her audience over.

凯文：谁是你最受欢迎的说书人？演讲者7：在洛杉矶有个女孩，她的写作基本上就像四墙小说，在加入Commaful之前她已经有了听众，她带来了相当一部分观众。

Kevin: Gotcha and what does popular mean does she have like, you guys have a thing  like subscribers?
Speaker 7: Yeah so she has about 700 followers. We have people who have more followers than  her however she gets the most likes on her stories, she gets the most engagement.

凯文：明白了，她有什么受欢迎的意思，你们有像订户这样的东西吗？主持人7：是的，她有大约700名追随者。我们有比她拥有更多追随者的人，然而她的故事得到了最多的赞，她得到了最多的订婚。

Kevin: How often does she publish?
Speaker 7: Probably a couple of times a month.

凯文：她多久出版一次？演讲者7：大概一个月几次。

Kevin: Couple of times a month gotcha.

凯文：一个月几次，抓到你了。

Dalton: Sorry just I want to really picture it, then when she publishers what is her  … You said there is a few things people can make, what is the thing  that she makes?
Speaker 7: Fiction stories.

道尔顿：对不起，我只是想象一下，当她出版她的…时你说有些东西是人们可以做的，她做的是什么？演讲者7：小说故事。

Dalton: How long are they usually?
Speaker 7: They take about three minutes to read they are about a 100 words.

道尔顿：通常多长时间？演讲者7：他们大约需要三分钟的时间来阅读-大概是100个字。

Dalton: Cool, would you say there is any similarities between this and some of the apps  that are like taking off right now that are like collaborative fiction? What’ s the  name of one of them, there is like three.

道尔顿：很酷，你会说这和一些应用程序有什么相似之处吗？这些应用程序就像现在推出的，就像合作小说一样？其中一个叫什么名字，大概有三个。

Speaker 7: Hooked tap.

扬声器7：钩式水龙头。

Dalton: Yeah, I’ve seen those, if you squint at it all, does it look like any  of those?
Speaker 7: It’s a very different model, those are built as games, there is a subscription model  built into them, however we have many similar users, so many of the target users  use both or they are conscious about the money they use Commaful. That’s kind of  the similar audience but different play.

道尔顿：是的，我见过这些，如果你都眯着眼睛看的话，它看起来像那些吗？扬声器7：这是一个非常不同的模型，那些是作为游戏构建的，有一个订阅模型，但是我们有许多相似的用户，所以很多目标用户同时使用，或者他们意识到他们使用Commaful的钱。这是一种类似的观众，但不同的戏剧。

Dalton: Do you have enough purchases and do you have anything at all that goes to  that?
Speaker 7: Currently no.

道尔顿：你有足够的东西买吗？你有什么可以买到的吗？发言者7：目前没有。

Dalton: Got it.  Or without a case like that. I’m just trying to think of how those companies  work okay.

道尔顿：明白了。或者没有这样的案子。我只是想想这些公司是如何运作的。

Kevin: Do you see this as… What’s the big version of this, what’s the metaphor that  you think of?
Speaker 7: Metaphor wise we see this as kind of how these teens interact with the written  word, you see Instagram and Snapchat as these very visual creatures, very short form types  of content. However, the written word really hasn’t seen much change. As a results a  lot of the stories that you can only through the written word that you can’t  tell through a Snapchat or on Instagram kind of get lost. For us we want  to be the bridge for this new generation to the written word and those types  of stories.

凯文：你认为这是…吗？这个的大版本是什么，你认为的隐喻是什么？说话者7：从隐喻的角度来看，我们认为这些青少年是如何与文字互动的，你可以看到Instagram和Snapchat是这些非常视觉的生物，非常简短的内容类型。然而，文字并没有发生太大的变化。结果，很多你只能通过文字而不能通过Snapchat或Instagram讲述的故事就会消失。对我们来说，我们想成为新一代书写文字和那些故事的桥梁。

Speaker 8: These stories are permanent, they exist in a space.

演讲者8：这些故事是永恒的，它们存在于一个空间里。

Dalton: Are there some stories from a year ago that are still super popular as per  the permanent question?
Speaker 8: Yeah.

道尔顿：根据永久的问题，还有一年前的故事仍然很受欢迎吗？演讲者8：是的。

Speaker 7: They still get hits, I wouldn’t say they blow up or they get a consistent  huge amounts of traffic but it shows up on search sometimes, sometimes it still resurfaces  in sharing in Twitter.

演讲者7：他们仍然会被点击，我不会说他们会爆炸，或者他们会得到大量的流量，但有时会出现在搜索中，有时还会在Twitter上再次出现。

Dalton: Do you have a sense of what percentage of your readers come from SCO?
Speaker 7: Very few, we get 700 clicks I think per month.

道尔顿：你知道你的读者中有多少来自上海合作组织吗？演讲者7：非常少，我想每个月都会有700次点击。

Dalton: What are the most consistent sources of traffic, like when you said it’s the authors  who promote it, so they post it to Twitter and Facebook and then that drives  traffic?
Speaker 7: It pretty much all.

道尔顿：什么是最稳定的流量来源，就像你说是作者在推广它，所以他们把它发到Twitter和Facebook上，然后驱动流量？演讲者7：差不多了。

Kevin: This is what success looks like to me in this sort of space. It really  comes down to, is you’ve build a platform that allows people to get things. That’s  pretty much it.

凯文：在这种情况下，这就是我眼中的成功。归根结底，你已经建立了一个平台，让人们可以得到东西。差不多就是这样。

Speaker 7: Yes it is.

演讲者7：是的。

Kevin: I think there is like three drivers of like desires by most people and it’s  like money , sex and then power or influence.

凯文：我认为大多数人都有三种类似欲望的驱动因素，这就像金钱，性，然后是权力或影响力。

Speaker 7: Yeah that makes sense.

演讲者7：是的，这是有道理的。

Kevin: I don’t know if it’s only three.

凯文：我不知道是不是只有三个。

Speaker 7: Right three, someone taught me.

演讲者7：对，第三，有人教我。

Kevin: That influence the biggest things, so does your platform allow people to get really popular,  do they generate stuff that lots of people want to see? Until you hit that,  the thing is dead in the water. This really it’s like what do I do  to bring and on board the very best story tellers, very best people. Ideally it’s  like you guys are constantly generating these service and they have to be really great.  But also it’s like hopefully your community is generating stuff and then are you able  to promote them better, that they can even promote themselves. Something has to happen there  and that’s your only goal, you can try to monetize et cetera but I think  it really comes down to is this a platform where it’s like, if I use  this it’s like or I want to tell stories on here because people actually read  or experience them. It’s like from what you saw from the medium the whole thing  is like what to do next? I don’t know that becomes really the hard part.  Sometimes you end up raising a bunch of money and doesn’t work out, but the  whole thing you have to at least get to the point where like it’s a  platform that gets people really popular. Everything has to do with looking at what is  somewhat popular and saying how do I multiply that, how do I replicate that? Is  there a portion of that where people see theirs and they start making for themselves.  It’s like I would go and just figure out how do I get let me  see here … The best story I heard from within the YC community was twitch.  The long stream platform and what they try to do was like, some people already  streaming, gaming on YouTube. They contacted all the top streamers on there and said like  what do we have to do to get you come to our platform? They did  whatever they wanted because they knew it’s a power locker for content. Only a handful  of people are going to be the most popular. That gives you the best headstart,  so they build whatever features, super nice etcetera. Where are the very best story tellers  for your sort of format? I would think it’s creative people who have been really  good on Snapchat or Instagram or whatever and say and say look you want more  than this, we can offer this to you and you have to figure out what  do they most want, then build those sort of features. Have you started doing that?
Speaker 7: Yes, so the last while we know a lot of top creators and that are  able.

凯文：这会影响最重要的事情，那么你的平台会让人们变得很受欢迎吗？他们会产生很多人想要看到的东西吗？在你撞到它之前，它已经死在水里了。这真的就像我该怎么做才能让最优秀的故事讲述者和最优秀的人参与进来。理想的情况是，就像你们不断地创造这些服务，他们必须是真正伟大的。但这也就像希望你的社区正在产生一些东西，然后你能更好地推广它们，他们甚至可以自我推销。有些事情必须发生，这是你唯一的目标，你可以尝试赚钱等等，但我认为这真的是一个平台，它是这样的，如果我用它就像，或者我想在这里讲故事，因为人们确实读过或经历过它们。就像你从媒体上看到的，整件事就像接下来该做什么？我不知道这是否真的很难。有时候，你最终会筹到一大笔钱，结果却没有效果，但你必须至少达到这样的程度，那就是它是一个能让人们真正受欢迎的平台。每件事都是关于看那些比较受欢迎的东西，然后说我如何将它乘以，如何复制它呢？其中是否有一部分是人们看到自己的，然后开始为自己制造的。就像我会去想办法，让我看看这里，…我从YC社区听到的最好的故事是抽搐。长流平台和他们试图做的是，有些人已经在YouTube上播放游戏。他们联系了那里所有的顶级彩带，问我们要怎么做才能让你来到我们的平台？他们做任何他们想做的事，因为他们知道这是一个内容储物柜。只有少数人会成为最受欢迎的人。这给了你最好的先发制人，所以他们建立了任何功能，超级好等等。对于你的格式来说，最优秀的故事讲述者在哪里？我认为是那些有创造力的人在Snapchat或Instagram上表现得很好，他们说你想要的不仅仅是这个，我们可以提供给你，你必须弄清楚他们最想要的是什么，然后构建这些特性。你开始这么做了吗？演讲者7：是的，所以最后一段时间我们认识了很多顶尖的创作者，这是有能力的。

Kevin: What does a top creator look like?
Speaker 7: Someone who has 10,000, 50,000, 100,000
Kevin: No, I want you to go find people that are the top ones.

凯文：顶级创造者长什么样？演讲者7：10，000，000，100，000凯文：不，我要你去找最顶尖的人。

Speaker 7: I see.

演讲者7：我明白了。

Kevin: You have to talk to them and figure out what would it actually pay.

凯文：你得和他们谈谈，弄清楚到底要付多少钱。

Speaker 7: The best out there is the million followers plus.

演讲者7：最好的是有百万的追随者加上。

Dalton: Could you just pulling people off Tumblr, because Tumblr is-
Speaker 7: That’s actually most of our traffics. When we say social both our traffic like 80%  is from Tumblr.

道尔顿：你能不能把人们从Tumblr上拉下来，因为Tumblr是-议长7：那实际上是我们大部分的交通。当我们说社交的时候，我们80%的流量都来自Tumblr。

Dalton: Okay because Tumblr Yahoo is not really taking care of and I imagine you can  pull the top Tumblr people right?
Speaker 7: Yeah, so we are actually are friends with almost all the top Tumblr creators. What  we’ve been thinking about is critical mass and we think that there is a certain  points that we want to spike everything with all of the users coming together as  one, where you hit this critical mass point and theoretically
Kevin: I would not even think of it like that, that’s too completed. Mostly it’s just  like all the popular kids and I’m just going to systematically talk to all of  them.

道尔顿：好吧，因为Tumblr雅虎并没有真正的照顾，我想你可以吸引顶级的Tumblr人，对吗？演讲者7：是的，所以我们实际上是几乎所有顶级Tumblr创作者的朋友。我们一直在考虑的是临界质量，我们认为有一个特定的点，我们想把所有的用户聚集在一起，在这里你达到这个临界质量点，理论上，凯文：我甚至不会这样想，这太完美了。大多数情况下，这就像所有受欢迎的孩子一样，我只想系统地和他们交谈。

Speaker 7: Just land grab get as many-
Kevin: As many as you can and because what you’re looking for is inspiration and you  don’t know what it’s going to be. You don’t know who is going to be  the one that makes a part from take off, you don’t know what this piece  that they are going to make. You need a lot of lightening striking, that’s hopefully  like people go like holy crap what’s this new platform.

说话人7：只要抓住土地，得到尽可能多-凯文：尽可能多，因为你正在寻找的是灵感，而你不知道它将是什么。你不知道谁会是从起飞中制造一部分的人，你不知道他们要做什么。你需要大量的闪电打击，这有希望就像人们去像神圣的垃圾，这是什么新的平台。

Dalton: I agree with that I mean like … I think that founders that are working  on a consumer internet stuff under count how many social things get to your skill  and then top out. They think everyone knows the story of Snapchat and Facebook and  they know about things like that but men even back in the day, there were  a lot of Facebook competitors like hundreds. A lot of them had millions of users.

道尔顿：我同意，我是说像…那样我认为，那些致力于网络消费的创始人们会计算出有多少社交活动会影响到你的技能，然后就会变得精力充沛。他们认为每个人都知道Snapchat和Facebook的故事，他们也知道类似的事情，但即使是在那个时代，Facebook上也有很多竞争对手，比如数百人。其中许多用户数以百万计。

Speaker 7: Right.

演讲者7：对。

Dalton: Tens of millions or users.

道尔顿：千万用户。

Speaker 7: it’s not meaningful.

演讲者7：这是没有意义的。

Dalton: The thing that’s tricky about consumer internet if we are not going to monetize by  charging our users is the only way you can ever bull an ad business as  you need hundreds of millions. I think in your … Think about Tumblr itself, they  had trouble with their ad business but remember they were the winner for every Tumblr,  they were like ten other little blogs sites, which it’s sounds like you guys are  experts. You remember them?
Speaker 7: Right.

道尔顿：消费者互联网的棘手之处在于，如果我们不想通过向用户收费来赚钱，那是唯一的办法，因为你需要数以亿计的广告业务。我觉得在你的…里想想Tumblr本身，他们在广告业务上遇到了麻烦，但是记住他们是每个Tumblr的赢家，他们就像另外10个小博客网站，听起来你们都是专家。你还记得他们吗？演讲者7：对。

Dalton: They were other want to be Tumblr that had even LiveJournal itself. LiveJournal was original  Tumblr. The point I’m making is like really Kevin, if you’re going to do this  kind of business, you usually want it to grow as fast as you can and  get those economies of scale otherwise you can get stuck in the hundred thousand to  million user range and then top out and then what? I know the founders of  a lot of those types of ones and those are rough, right.

道尔顿：他们还想成为Tumblr，甚至连LiveJournal也不例外。LiveJournal是原版的Tumblr。我要说的是，真的，凯文，如果你要做这样的生意，你通常希望它尽可能快的增长，并获得规模经济，否则你会被困在几十万到百万的用户范围内，然后达到极限，然后呢？我知道很多这类公司的创始人都很粗糙，对吧。

Kevin: Yeah. I feel like you want both a bunch of users and then a bunch  of different stories. Again be what are the top things that people have done on  Tumblr, recreating it on your platform. Like top tweet stories, that’s like series like small  pieces of text and then read, tell them on your platform.

凯文：是啊。我觉得你既想要一群用户，又想要一堆不同的故事。同样是人们在Tumblr上所做的最重要的事情，在你的平台上重新创建它。就像推特上的故事一样，这就像一系列小片段的文字，然后阅读，在你的平台上告诉他们。

Dalton: That’s probably a twitch thing, just ask them what would it take for you to  move everything over from Tumblr? What features do we need to build for you to  take everything from your Tumblr over here and then put up an audio Tumblr blog  post and then point to your site. If you just didn’t that systematically, that was  the twitch play book. Hang out word, I think now is the time to raid  the Tumblr users.

道尔顿：这可能是个抽搐的问题，问问他们，你要怎么才能把所有的东西都从Tumblr搬过来？我们需要为您构建哪些功能，以便您从Tumblr中获取所有内容，然后张贴一个音频Tumblr博客文章，然后指向您的站点。如果你不那么系统的话，那就是“抽搐游戏”了。我想现在是时候搜查Tumblr的用户了。

Speaker 8: One of the most popular things we have it’s a so people take content from  Tumblr and then post on Commaful and we have an export function, every social site  has a different preferred format. On Tumblr we export as photo site. If you're sharing  Tumblr it automatically generates photo sites that’s pretty … It fits on Tumblr. Facebook is  different, Twitter is different.

演讲者8：最受欢迎的事情之一，我们有一个，所以人们从Tumblr的内容，然后张贴在Commaful和我们有一个导出功能，每个社交网站有不同的首选格式。在Tumblr上，我们作为照片站点输出。如果您共享Tumblr，它会自动生成漂亮的…照片站点适合Tumblr。Facebook是不同的，Twitter是不同的。

Kevin: You should also look at all the people making the little stories on medium too,  still on them as well.

凯文：你也应该看看那些在媒体上写小故事的人，也应该看看他们。

Speaker 8: Those are incredible stories too.

演讲者8：这些也是令人难以置信的故事。

Kevin: The whole thing is like figure out, talk to the top story tellers, talk to  the top people who are on all those different platforms, figure out what it’s going  to take to bring them over or start moving some of that stuff over automatically  and just showing it off to the community and seeing what steps what people really  like, what goes around.

凯文：整件事就像搞清楚，和高层出纳员交谈，和那些不同平台上的高层人士交谈，找出需要什么才能把他们带过来，或者自动地把其中的一些东西搬过来，然后向社区展示，看看人们真正喜欢的是什么，会发生什么。

Dalton: Because like consumer is different. I think a lot of times people out of in  the audience world, they hear these consumer things, which is just get big, get big  and that is what we’re telling you. But just for everyone else in the audience  that’s the case if you’re doing like B2B. This is not like once size fits  all advice but if you’re going to … Hey you’re launched you’re doing consumer internet  you have a 100,000 MAU, you made it this far, you’ve got to power through  here. Or else if you end up stalling out, then what? You don’t have enough  users to really monetize and we’ve just seen a lot of people stall out of  this stage. In your case yeah you got to go grow.

道尔顿：因为就像消费者不一样。我想很多时候，观众世界里的人们都会听到这些消费的东西，这些东西就是变大，这就是我们要告诉你们的。但是对于观众中的其他人来说，如果你做的像B2B一样的话，情况就是这样的。这不像一旦大小适合所有的建议，但如果你要去…嘿，你启动了-你在做消费者互联网-你有一个10万毛，你做到了这一点，你必须在这里供电。否则如果你最后拖延时间，那又怎样？你没有足够的用户真正赚钱，我们刚刚看到很多人停止了这个阶段。在你的情况下，是的，你得去成长。

Speaker 8: We are in the problem solving position here.

演讲者8：我们现在处于解决问题的位置。

Kevin: Yeah. You need to generate whatever it takes to get people the world of mouth  about your thing is like oh, if I’m a really good creator I tell those  stories on this platform, I can get really big.

凯文：是啊。你需要做些什么才能让人们对你的事情充满口碑，哦，如果我是一个很好的创造者，我会在这个平台上讲述那些故事，我会变得很大。

Dalton: One of the piece of tactical advice, I would look at SCO. Usually like the  way you get really huge I built a consumer site I got it up to  25 Million MAU and SCO was a big part of that, the way you do  something like Quora where you get hundreds of millions of MAU is SCO. I would  try to start tracking it.

道尔顿：战术上的建议之一，我会看看上海合作组织。通常情况下，就像你变得非常庞大，我建立了一个消费者网站，我得到了高达2500万毛，上海合作组织是其中的一个很大一部分，你做的事情，像Quora，在那里你得到了数以亿计的茂是上海合作组织。我会开始追踪它。

Speaker 7: We find that embedding helps us get back links and help us rank some of  those stories that normally wouldn’t write.

演讲者7：我们发现嵌入可以帮助我们获得反向链接，并帮助我们对一些通常不会写的故事进行排序。

Speaker 8: We pushing SCO currently right now yeah.

演讲者8：我们目前正在推动上海合作组织，是的。

Dalton: Okay, good that’s the sort of thing it doesn’t cost you anything and that will  just get the flywheel spinning for you to hit that escape velocity. Five minutes.

道尔顿：很好，这是一种不需要花费任何代价的东西，它只会让飞轮旋转，让你达到逃逸速度。五分钟。

Kevin: Any questions for us?
Speaker 7: I think the biggest challenge for us obviously is getting from our 100,000 10 Million,  like that’s the next big phase. You’ve already kind of gone over different strategies, I’m  curious what other companies that you’ve seen throw going through YC who have successfully gone  from that 100,000 to millions.

凯文：有什么问题吗？演讲者7：我认为对我们最大的挑战显然是从我们的10万，000，000，000，似乎这是下一个大阶段。你已经考虑过不同的策略了，我很好奇你所看到的其他公司通过YC成功地从10万发展到了数百万。

Kevin: It’s still parallel, it’s always parallel for those kind of communities. The top ones bring  almost all the traffic. Which is why I’m saying like everything you have to do  is how do I bring on celebrities onto the platform or return people in this-
Dalton: Well, in along those lines here is the pitfall, don’t pay them. I’ve seen people  try that, that is not … Paying for traffic when you don’t have revenue is  like-
Kevin: They need to love.

凯文：它仍然是平行的，对于那些社区来说总是平行的。最上层的车辆几乎带来了所有的交通。这就是为什么我说，就像你要做的所有事情一样，我要如何把名人带到平台上，或者在这个平台上让人们回归-道尔顿：嗯，沿着这些思路，这是一个陷阱，不要付钱给他们。我见过有人这么做，那不是…当你没有收入的时候支付交通费用就像-凯文：他们需要爱。

Speaker 7: Once you pay them they also expect to be paid in order to make something.

演讲者7：一旦你给了他们钱，他们也期望得到报酬，以制造一些东西。

Dalton: That is exactly right, as far as … My understanding is Instagram never paid anyone,  Snapchat never paid anyone, all their clones sure did right but that’s … you know  what I’m saying?
Speaker 7: Yes got it.

道尔顿：没错，就…而言我的理解是Instagram从来不付钱给任何人，Snapchat从来不付钱给任何人，他们所有的克隆人都做对了，但这是…你知道我在说什么吗？演讲者7：是的，明白了。

Dalton: YouTube wasn’t really paying for traffic but all of the wannabe YouTube that were trying  to raise for money, were paying for traffic. Whatever you try don’t just take what  he’s saying and be like yeah we are just going to pay some celebrities and-
Speaker 7: Right:
Kevin: It’s not a cost effective way of growing.

道尔顿：YouTube并不是真正为流量付费，但所有想要筹集资金的YouTube都在为流量付费。不管你尝试什么，不要只听他的话，就像他说的那样，我们只会付钱给一些名人-议长7：好吧：凯文：这不是一种成本效益高的增长方式。

Dalton: Yeah. I think if you have the dev cycle I don’t know if you do,  but I would consider a mobile app, one advantage from a retention perspective is that  you can do push notifications and that way if someone is subscribing to something and  you do pushed notification to their followers, then you’re ensuring a much, a tighter feedback  loop that maybe you have now on mobile web. What are you doing with the  email Joe?
Speaker 7: Because they’re teams email has been pretty tricky in terms of getting high response rates,  we try messenger bots, so we get some decent response right there, still nothing huge  or significant.

道尔顿：是的。我想，如果你有开发周期，我不知道你是否有，但我会考虑一个移动应用程序，从保留的角度来看，一个好处是你可以做推送通知，如果有人订阅了什么，而你确实把通知推给了他们的追随者，那么你确保了一个更紧密的反馈循环，也许你现在已经在移动网络上了。你在处理电子邮件吗乔？演讲者7：由于他们是团队，电子邮件在获得高响应率方面相当棘手，我们尝试了信使机器人，因此我们在那里得到了一些不错的响应，仍然没有什么大的或有意义的。

Dalton: I want to keep explaining one of those, again you’re asking what have people done?  You have to reach out and touch people for them to not forget the thing  exist. Think about like there is a million apps out there, everything is competing for  attention and if you think about tools like Facebook it’s basically a weaponized attention grabber.  They have thousands of people working on making sure that you’re constantly looking back at  it. Very smart people that’s all they do all day, it’s try to like steal  your attention and you’re competing with them for attention.

道尔顿：我想继续解释其中的一个，你又在问人们做了什么？你必须伸出手去触摸人们，让他们不要忘记存在的东西。想想看，就像有上百万的应用程序一样，所有的东西都在争夺注意力，如果你想到像Facebook这样的工具，它基本上就是一种武器化的注意力抓取器。他们有成千上万的人致力于确保你不断地回顾它。非常聪明的人-他们整天都在这样做-就是想偷取你的注意力，而你却在和他们竞争注意力。

Speaker 7: Exactly:
Dalton: I think just doing some really basic stuff, like continuing to write on email, if  chat is the right thing to do, make sure people remember you exist and that  they are a member of your community and that they should go check out some  new stories otherwise it’s going to be tricky. One experiment you can do I’ve heard  someone give this talk before is go create a Facebook account with like a fake  email and don’t add any friends and look at how emails they’ve sent you.

演讲者7：没错：道尔顿：我认为只是做一些非常基本的事情，比如继续写电子邮件，如果聊天是正确的事情，确保人们记住你的存在，他们是你社区的一员，他们应该去看看一些新的故事，否则就会很棘手。你可以做的一个实验-我听过有人做过这样的演讲-去创建一个像假邮件一样的Facebook账户，不要添加任何朋友，看看他们是如何发送给你的。

Speaker 8: I’ve done that actually.

演讲者8：实际上我已经做过了。

Dalton: I think it sends you like 50 I’m exaggerating.

道尔顿：我想这会让你像50岁一样，我有点夸张了。

Speaker 8: .

发言者8：

Dalton: But the point is they realize that if you don’t add any friends that you’re  going to have a bad time and that you’re useless to them and so they  are very aggressive about emailing people. They know they’ve churned you. Anyway if you have  users that you know are going to churn or way past churning just remind them  that you exist. That’s best practices too.

道尔顿：但重点是，他们意识到，如果你不加任何朋友，你会有一个不好的时间，你是无用的，所以他们是非常积极的电子邮件的人。他们知道他们搅动了你。不管怎么说，如果你的用户是你知道的要搅乱或远超过搅动，只要提醒他们，你的存在。这也是最佳做法。

Speaker 7: Right make sense.

发言者7：正确是有道理的。

Kevin: Guys thank you so much.

伙计们，太感谢你们了。

Speaker 8: Thank you.

发言者8：谢谢。

Dalton: Thank you, I appreciate it.

道尔顿：谢谢，我很感激。

Kevin: Thanks a lot.

凯文：非常感谢。

Dalton: OK cool, well I think that’s it for us.


道尔顿：好吧，我想我们就这样吧。
