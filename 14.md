# How to Build and Manage Teams - Vinod Khosla

Anu Hariharan: Today we have Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures and former founder of Sun Microsystems.  He has advised a lot of start-ups in Silicon Valley.

Anu Hariharan：今天我们有Vinod Khosla，Khosla Ventures的创始人和Sun Microsystems的前创始人。他曾为硅谷的许多初创公司提供咨询。

I'm going to interview Vinod  today, and we're going to talk about how to build and manage teams. Thank you,  Vinod for taking the time. You've talked a lot about company building and hiring.

今天我要采访维诺德，我们将讨论如何建立和管理团队。谢谢你，维诺德抽出时间。你已经谈了很多关于公司建设和招聘的话题了。

I  know that you've often said that a company becomes the people it hires not the  plan it makes. Can you elaborate on what you mean by that, and especially for  founders who are just beginning to start a company. What should they focus on in  hiring?
Vinod Khosla: Yeah, that's one of my favorite topics. Many, many founders, and when you start you  know very little about what you're doing.

我知道你经常说，一家公司变成了它雇用的人，而不是它制定的计划。你能详细说明一下你的意思吗，尤其是刚开始创业的创始人。他们在招聘时应该注重什么？维诺德·科斯拉：是的，这是我最喜欢的话题之一。很多创始人，当你开始创业的时候，你对自己所做的事情知之甚少。

If you did know enough, you wouldn't start  the company.

如果你知道得够多的话，你就不会创办这家公司了。

If you were really sensible and pragmatic, you wouldn't start companies.

如果你真的明智和务实，你就不会创办公司。

I'm an  entrepreneurship zealot self-described.

我是一个自我描述的企业家狂热者。

I'm a real fan of people trying companies, and trying to build  things, especially when you're younger when you can afford to take the risks. There's no  reason to go work for somebody else in my book, and I never did. What  I find is people have plans but it is very, very rare for a company  to achieve that plan. The way to think about where you're starting is a collection  of ideas in a relatively rich space that you find you can be passionate about.  That's the way to think about a plan.

我是一个真正的粉丝尝试公司，并试图建设的东西，特别是当你年轻时，当你有能力承担风险。在我的书里，没有理由为别人工作，而我从来没有这样做过。我发现人们都有计划，但对于一家公司来说，实现这一计划是非常罕见的。思考你从哪里开始的方法是在一个相对丰富的空间里收集一些想法，你会发现你可以对它充满激情。这就是思考计划的方式。

I have a separate talk on flexi  planning, which is don't plan, just plan to plan. The critical part of that is  the team you build ends up making all day to day decisions about where you're  going to end up. Whether to higher the next person from this area or that  area or with that strength or some other strength, or to pick path A or  B, is very, very critical to where a company ends up. There's a huge path  dependence, and the path depends so much on the people you hire. You're starting plan  becomes much less relevant than the people you higher initially, especially the first 10 people.  Those 10 people will then go on to hire the next 50, and they will  then hire the last 100. You can fire the original team, and it's gene DNA  stays in the company. That's why it's so important, and why the people you hire  determine the company becomes. We can come back later and talk about where I see  mistakes made around functional hiring. People always ask me, and I say this gets treated  a lot, there's a huge difference between a zero million dollar company, and a zero  billion dollar company. The difference is attitude and ambition and mostly the kind of team  you build, which will reinforce certain directions for you especially who else you end up  hiring.

我有一个关于柔性版计划的单独的讨论，那就是不计划，只是计划。这其中的关键部分是，你所构建的团队最终每天都在对你最终走向何方做出决定。无论是从这个地区或那个地区的下一个人，还是以这种力量或其他力量，还是选择A或B的路径，对于公司最终的结局来说，都是非常关键的。有一个巨大的路径依赖，这条路在很大程度上取决于你雇佣的人。你开始的计划变得比你最初更高的人，特别是前10个人的相关性要小得多。然后，这10个人将继续雇用下一个50人，然后他们将雇用最后100人。你可以解雇原来的团队，然后基因DNA就会留在公司里。这就是它如此重要的原因，也是为什么你雇佣的人决定了公司的发展。我们可以稍后再来谈谈我在官职招聘方面所犯的错误。人们总是问我，我说这会受到很大的对待，一家零百万美元的公司和一家零十亿美元的公司之间有很大的区别。不同之处在于你的态度和抱负，以及你所建立的团队，这将加强你的某些方向，尤其是你最终雇佣的其他人。

It's far more critical than people believe, and it's really hard to hire those  skills later.

这比人们所相信的要重要得多，以后再雇用这些技能真的很难。

Anu Hariharan: Yeah, and I think you've touched upon the first 10 hires being so important, and  especially defining pretty much even the culture or the belief system that you would call  for the company. A lot of founders here have like a one or two member  teams. How should they think about who should be those first few hires, and how  do they go about finding those candidates? I know you also have a strong view  about how equity should be split for the first 10 employees versus and next 30,  so would love to hear how should a founder think about that?
Vinod Khosla: Many start-ups are very tactical and they should be.

是的，我想你已经提到了最初的10名员工是如此重要，尤其是定义了你为公司所要求的文化或信仰体系。这里很多创始人都有一个或两个成员团队。他们应该如何思考谁应该是第一批聘用的人，以及他们如何去寻找那些候选人呢？我知道，你也对前10名员工和接下来30名员工应该如何分割股权持有强烈的看法，所以很想听听创始人应该如何看待这一点？维诺德·科斯拉：许多新兵都是非常有策略的，他们应该是这样的。

In doing the tactics, you can  sometimes forget what the big vision is. You may even exclude the big vision.

在做战术时，你有时会忘记什么是宏大的愿景。你甚至可以排除大视野。

I  was talking to a company fairly recently in our portfolio that hired a bunch of  people to do particular tasks that needed doing. There was a new hire, potentially a  big hire, very attractive person to have join the team.

我最近和一家公司谈过，他们雇佣了一群人去做一些需要做的事情。有一个新的雇用，潜在的一个很大的雇用，非常有吸引力的人加入了这个团队。

I asked the founder, "Who's  going to interview?" He told me who would interview, this founder.

我问创始人：“谁来面试？”他告诉我谁会采访这位创始人。

I said, "If I  was a really great candidate, and these three people interviewed me first, I'd drop out  of the recruiting process." I said, "You know what? Why don't I be the first  interviewer? That can be a real waste of my time because I want him to  grab the big vision first and not just be interviewed. Let me sell him on  the big idea, and why he can be a part of honing it." The best  people almost can't be interviewed. They have to be sold and evaluated. Evaluation's important, but  evaluation and interviewing are different things in my mind. Once you hired the first five,  and they interview other people, you might actually exclude the best candidates. That's very, very  tricky for a founder. At the same time sometimes you can't afford the big name,  so you don't have enough to attract them. Those are very tricky times. That's why  I think whether you're zero million dollar company or zero billion dollar company sort of  gets set by the time you're 15 or 20 people. There's people who've done it  very poorly.

我说，“如果我是一个很棒的候选人，这三个人先面试我，我会退出招聘过程。”我说：“你知道吗？为什么我不成为第一位面试官呢？这真的是在浪费我的时间，因为我希望他先抓住远大的愿景，而不仅仅是接受面试。让我向他推销这个伟大的想法，以及为什么他可以参与其中。”最好的人几乎无法接受采访。它们必须被出售和评估。评价很重要，但是评价和面试在我的脑海里是不同的。一旦你雇佣了前五个人，他们就会面试其他人，实际上你可能会把最好的候选人排除在外。对于一个创始人来说，这是非常棘手的。同时，有时你买不起大牌，所以你没有足够的钱去吸引他们。那是非常棘手的时期。这就是为什么我认为，无论你是零百万美元的公司还是零十亿美元的公司，在你15到20岁的时候就能确定下来。有些人做得很差。

I won't give you examples, but people like Stripe, Patrick did it amazingly  great job of his early hires, and has continued to do that. You can completely  change the trajectory of a company by that hiring and how big you'll become.

我不会给你举例子，但是像斯特里普这样的人，帕特里克在他早期的工作中做得非常出色，并且一直在这样做。你可以完全改变一家公司的发展轨迹，通过招聘和你将变得有多大。

Anu Hariharan: What are some of the things that you think Patrick at Stripe or some of  these successful founders have done in the first year.

Hariharan：你认为Stripe的Patrick或者这些成功的创始人在第一年做了什么。

Is it that they meet candidates  in other roles? Because the founder often also doesn't know a lot of the other  roles, or doesn't have domain knowledge about the roles that they are looking to hire.

是因为他们遇到了其他职位的候选人吗？因为创始人通常也不知道很多其他的角色，或者对他们想要雇佣的角色没有领域知识。

Vinod Khosla: Let's talk about each of those separately because they're quite distinct things. First, I think  of company-building as going after Mount Everest, but nobody got to Mount Everest without getting  to base camp first. Here's the misstep. You can't get to Everest without basecamp. Many  people forget that basecamp has to lead to Everest, so they set up basecamp where  it doesn't help reduce the risk to Everest. Building a company you never shoot for  the big enchilada in one step. You go after basecamp one, then basecamp two.

维诺德·科斯拉：让我们分别来讨论它们，因为它们是完全不同的东西。首先，我认为建立公司是为了追赶珠穆朗玛峰，但没有人能到达珠穆朗玛峰，除非先到达营地。这是错误的一步。没有基地你去不了珠穆朗玛峰。许多人忘记了基地必须导致珠穆朗玛峰，所以他们建立基地，这无助于降低珠穆朗玛峰的风险。一步地建立一家你从不为大公司而射击的公司。你去追一级基地，然后是2号基地。

It's  a very good analogy. However, especially with bad investors, and I have a lot of  beefs about investors. They want revenue, or they want break even, or they want management,  all the things that can lead to setting up here that then excludes the possibility  that you learn more about how to get to basecamp two and three. You are  out in some other local minima or maxima. That's really dangerous early on, too.

这是一个很好的类比。然而，特别是对坏投资者，我有很多关于投资者的担心。他们想要收入，或者他们想要收支平衡，或者他们想要管理，所有可以在这里建立的东西，然后排除你学习更多关于如何建立第二和第三基础的可能性。你在其他地方的极小值或极大值。这么早也很危险。

In  fact, one of the beefs I was just talking to somebody in the YC class,  and talking about this.

事实上，我刚才和YC班的人谈过这件事。

I said, "This is one of my pieces of advice to  YC.

我说：“这是我对YC的建议之一。

If you get too tactical and forget the strategic, you'll set up basecamp in  the wrong place." You want to decide which is the rich space you're going to  go after with the technology, in this case, starting with great technology, before you start  doing all the tactical stuff. There's this uncomfortable balance between tactics and strategy.

如果你过于战术化，而忘记了战略，你就会在错误的地方建立基地。“你想要决定，在你开始做所有战术性的事情之前，你将追求哪个是你要追求的丰富空间，在这种情况下，你要从伟大的技术开始。战术和战略之间存在着一种令人不快的平衡。”

I say  be obstinate about your vision, be flexible about your tactics. Another way I like to  say it is think big but act small. These are really difficult things to navigate,  much easier said than done. Back to this issue, let me talk about a process  I call gene pool engineering.

我说对你的眼光要固执，对你的战术要灵活。我喜欢说的另一种说法是，要有远大的想法，但要表现得小一些。这些都是很难把握的事情，说起来容易做起来难。回到这个问题，让我谈谈一个我称之为基因库工程的过程。

If you're going after a space, assuming you pick the  right space, or the one you're passionate about.

如果你在追求一个空间，假设你选择了正确的空间，或者你热爱的空间。

It doesn't even have to be right  for others, right for you. The first thing I suggest people do is say all  the ways in which you can fail. Think about it. You want to identify the  key risks in whatever you're trying to do. Then you hire for those risks. Always  say to people, find your top five risks. For each of those risks, say risk  one, who are the companies that have dealt with that risk, or where does the  expertise on that risk lie? Make a list of three to five companies, and by  the way this document, you'll get a link called gene pool engineering. That's on our  website that I wrote just for this purpose.

它甚至不一定对其他人，对你是对的。我建议人们做的第一件事就是说出你可能失败的所有方式。好好想想。你想找出你想做的任何事情的关键风险。那你就为这些风险雇个人。总是对别人说，找出你的前五大风险。对于这些风险中的每一种，风险一号说，谁是处理过这种风险的公司，或者关于这种风险的专业知识在哪里？列出三到五家公司的名单，顺便说一句，你会得到一个叫做基因库工程的链接。这是在我们的网站上写的，我就是为了这个目的而写的。

If you've identified the five companies that  have dealt with that risk, then you have at least the places that can reduce  your risk. Within each company identify three names. Now you have 15 names for the  risk number one.

如果你已经确定了五家已经处理过这种风险的公司，那么你至少有一些地方可以降低你的风险。在每个公司内确定三个名字。现在你有了第一个风险的15个名字。

If you do that for your top five risks, you essentially have  a library of names that will help you reduce the risk in your business. That's  risk oriented management. Start-ups after you decide what space you're going after is all about  risk management. There's lots of risk trade offs. Every time you hire somebody increase your  burn, you're taking on financial risk, but you're reducing some other risk, maybe it's product  risk, or development risk, or feature risk.

如果您这样做是为了您的前五大风险，您基本上有一个人名库，这将帮助您降低您的业务风险。这是以风险为导向的管理。当你决定你要追求的空间是风险管理的时候，你就开始创业了。有很多风险权衡。每次你雇佣一个人时，你都会承担财务风险，但你会减少一些其他风险，可能是产品风险，开发风险，或者特征风险。

It's a series of trade offs. That's how  start-ups should think about what they're trying to do. This is a process I call  gene poll engineering, where you engineer 15 names for each of your major risks, and  then go after all of them, and hopefully hire one or two of the 15.  You've then engineered the gene pool of your company for the risks that are you  in the plan you're going to pursue.

这是一系列的权衡。这就是创业公司应该如何思考他们想要做的事情。这是一个我称之为基因投票工程的过程，你为你的每一个主要风险设计15个名字，然后追踪所有的风险，希望雇佣其中的一个或两个。然后，你设计了公司的基因库，以应对计划中的风险。

It's way more precise than the platitude of  let's hire great people.

这比我们雇佣优秀员工的陈词滥调要精确得多。

I find that really disturbing because I've never actually had a  start-up come in to me and say they're only hiring bad people. Never quite happens.  How do you make platitudes into something concrete and actionable? That's a big thing with  me. The second part of that is the reality that students seldom pursue the original  plan they started with. You also have to hire not only for the risks you  know, but all the other things that you might pivot to, change to, adapt to,  iterate to. Building a business plan in a new area is a series of iterations.  Suddenly this risk requirement goes in parallel with this other requirement, which I call smart  adaptation. You adapt very quickly to whatever the market is teaching you, and is particularly  good at that. Teaching you how to iterate quickly and learn. Essentially, very similar to  what I call this flexi-planning process where you iterate your way to a plan instead  of saying this is my plan.

我发现这真的很令人不安，因为我从来没有真正有过一家创业公司来找我，说他们只是在雇佣坏人。从来没有发生过。你是如何把陈词滥调变成具体可行的？这对我来说是件大事。第二部分是学生很少追求最初计划的现实。你还必须雇用不仅因为你知道的风险，而且所有其他的事情，你可能会转向，改变，适应，迭代。在新领域中构建业务计划是一系列迭代。突然间，这一风险要求与另一项要求并行，我称之为智能适应。你很快就适应了市场告诉你的任何东西，而且在这方面特别擅长。教你如何快速迭代和学习。本质上，非常类似于我所称的柔性计划过程，在这个过程中，你迭代到一个计划，而不是说这是我的计划。

I always worry when people make plans seven years  out, and give me forecast because it tells me they don't have a clue what  they don't know. That is one of the great benefits of YC from my point  of view, this iterative approach. Other people call it MVP or there's other names for  this iterative approach.

我总是担心，当人们制定七年的计划，并给我预测，因为它告诉我，他们不知道什么他们不知道。在我看来，这是YC最大的好处之一，这种迭代方法。其他人称它为MVP，或者这种迭代方法有其他名称。

I call it flexi-planning. The team you build in addition to this  risk approach also has to be open to new ideas, grab new ideas, ask a  lot of questions, adapt quickly, brainstorm with others constructively so you build on each other  ideas. These are parallel set of requirements around hiring that are very hard to quantify.  They're also full of danger for the following reason. Sometimes people don't hire for this,  that's a danger, and other times, and one of the biggest risks if you decide  you want to be aggressive about hiring is going after names or titles or other  things. Big names and titles in big companies are really, really dangerous and misleading for  start-ups. My biggest mistakes early on in my career was getting too impressed with somebody's  title at IBM or some big company. Now I take the view that if somebody's  been at a big company for 10 or 15 years, if they've been at Cisco  for 10 years, they can't work effectively in a start-up until they get re-brainwashed by  failing once or twice in a start-up. Then it will work. Hiring for this other  stuff and not falling into the trap of just big names is very important. Also  depends upon your domain.

我称之为弹性计划。除了这种风险方法之外，你所建立的团队还必须对新的想法敞开心扉，抓住新的想法，提出许多问题，迅速适应，与其他人进行建设性的头脑风暴，这样你们就可以建立在彼此的想法之上。这些都是与招聘相关的并行要求，很难量化。他们也充满了危险，原因如下。有时人们不会为此雇佣，这是一个危险，而其他时候，最大的风险之一，如果你认为你想要积极的招聘是追求姓名或头衔或其他事情。大公司的大牌和头衔对初创企业来说是非常危险和误导的。在我职业生涯的早期，我最大的错误就是对IBM或某家大公司的头衔印象太深了。现在我认为，如果有人在一家大公司工作了10年或15年，如果他们已经在思科工作了10年，那么他们在创业初期就无法有效地工作，除非他们在创业中失败一次或两次而被洗脑。那就成功了。雇佣其他人，而不是掉进大牌的陷阱是非常重要的。也取决于您的域名。

If the domain your start-up is in is radically different ...  Let me put it differently. Some domains need a lot of expertise.

如果你的初创公司所在的领域完全不同.让我换个说法。有些领域需要大量的专业知识。

If you're doing  a blood test like , you can drop out of school and start that, but  eventually it's a serious physics and chemistry problem, and you have to get that talent  on board.

如果你在做血液测试，你可以从学校辍学开始，但最终这是一个严重的物理和化学问题，你必须让这位天才加入其中。

If you're doing something like Stripe did, it was very simple problem. You  don't need three PhDs.

如果你做的事情像Stripe做的那样，这是一个非常简单的问题。你不需要三个博士。

If you're going to solve health care with AI, you're going  to need expertise.

如果你要用人工智能解决医疗问题，你需要专业知识。

It depends on the domain. You don't always need the gurus.

这取决于域。你并不总是需要大师。

It  depends on your problem. You don't always need the big names. Another very counter intuitive  thing, we were recruiting for a CEO for our company AliveCor. They essentially do cardiac  care.

这取决于你的问题。你不总是需要大人物。另一件非常违背直觉的事情是，我们正在为我们的公司AliveCor招聘一位CEO。他们本质上是做心脏护理的。

I insisted I would not talk to any candidate who had ever worked in  health care, and that's because health care executives tend to apply old rules because their  domain hasn't changed very much. People are so used to applying old us, and applying  good process, as opposed to inventing this new future, this new path. That's very dangerous.  We should come back and talk about how founders should figure all this out when  they don't have a clue what these other functions are. That's really dangerous, and so  that's a big, big caution.

我坚持说，我不会和任何曾经在医疗保健领域工作过的候选人交谈，这是因为医疗管理人员倾向于采用旧的规则，因为他们的领域并没有发生太大的变化。人们习惯于应用旧的我们，并应用良好的过程，而不是发明这一新的未来，这条新的道路。太危险了。我们应该回来讨论一下，当创始人不知道这些其他功能是什么的时候，他们应该如何解决这些问题。这真的很危险，所以这是一个非常大的警告。

It's seldom that a person out of a domain can  innovate in a domain, and if you're a young founder, and you hire somebody with  deep experience in a domain, it is logical as human beings to defer more to  their knowledge, and that is a real problem.

一个领域之外的人很少能在一个领域里进行创新，如果你是一个年轻的创始人，你会雇佣一个在某个领域有丰富经验的人，作为一个人，更多地尊重他们的知识是合乎逻辑的，这是一个真正的问题。

It's important to understand the problems they  raise not the solutions they propose.

理解他们提出的问题很重要，而不是他们提出的解决方案。

If you take that, you'll keep doing what traditional  people in that industry have done. This is why CEO hired into companies don't work  very well, and why founder vision becomes so important and so critical.

如果你这样做，你就会继续做那个行业里传统的人所做的事情。这就是为什么受雇于公司的首席执行官工作效率不高的原因，也是为什么创始人的愿景变得如此重要和如此关键的原因。

I'm wandering all  over the place, but correct me.

我到处乱跑，但请纠正我。

Anu Hariharan: Before we touch on the functional hiring, and how to look for domain knowledge, I  wanted to touch upon one other element that you talked about in the gene pool  hiring paper, which is about diversity. Not in the literal sense, but you talked about  there are different dimensions of diversity that are important as you're trying to figure out  candidates. Can you elaborate on what are the different dimensions of diversity a start-up should  really focus on, and why is it important to do that early on?
Vinod Khosla: Yeah, so if you buy the thesis that most of what you end up executing  on isn't part of your plans today, then the single most important thing becomes people  who can help you evolve your plan. The more diverse the set of people, and  I don't mean diverse ethnically, I mean backgrounds, places they've worked, areas they know, age,  level of experience, there's some really great things about experience. You want experience, but you  don't want experience to guide you into doing what others have already done in that  same business and not innovate. That is the result of too much experience. Mixing the  right experience where you can identify the problems with first principles thinking from fresh new  ideas, people who've never worked in the domain, or people who actually are just fresh  graduates, and have no idea, but can ask fundamental questions, those are the best kind  of founders. Put it differently, in big companies, you need people with good process.

ANU Hariharan：在我们讨论功能性招聘和如何寻找领域知识之前，我想谈谈基因库招聘论文中提到的另一个要素，那就是多样性。不是字面意义上的，但你说的是多样性的不同维度，在你试图找出候选人的过程中，这些维度是很重要的。你能详细说明一个创业公司真正应该关注的多样性的不同维度吗？为什么这么早就这么做很重要？维诺德·科斯拉：是的，如果你相信你最终执行的大部分东西不是你今天计划的一部分，那么最重要的事情就是那些能帮助你制定计划的人。人越多，我不是指不同的种族，我指的是背景，他们工作过的地方，他们知道的领域，年龄，经验水平，关于经验有一些很棒的东西。你需要经验，但你不希望经验引导你去做别人在同一项业务中已经做过的事情，而不是创新。这是经验过多的结果。在正确的经验中，你可以从新的新想法、从未在这个领域工作过的人，或者那些实际上只是刚毕业的人，但你可以问一些基本的问题，这些都是最好的创始人。换句话说，在大公司里，你需要有良好流程的人。

In  start-ups you need people with good iteration and good adaptation. Those are very, very, different  skills because in start-ups you invent 90% of stuff.

在创业中，你需要有良好的迭代和良好的适应能力的人。这些是非常，不同的技能，因为在初创企业中，90%的东西都是你发明的。

In big companies, 90% of what  you do this year will be what was done last year. There's very little innovation.  Takes a different kind of person. Both valuable, in fact, every start-up if they're successful,  they'll need some process people later, but process people early in a start-up can be  a disaster. Too good a manager is a bad thing for early start-upstairs, but at  some point you really need to add that. That's what I mean by diversity.

在大公司里，你今年所做的90%将是去年所做的。几乎没有创新。需要一个不同的人。事实上，每一个创业公司都是有价值的，如果他们成功的话，他们以后需要一些流程人员，但在创业初期处理员工可能是一场灾难。太好的经理是一件坏事，早开始-楼上，但在某个时候，你真的需要补充这一点。这就是我所说的多样性。

If  you have a bunch of PhDs, how many are experienced PhDs, how many are fresh?  How many are from within your area, and how many are from completely outside the  area. Every dimension of diversity will help because they'll bring a different point of view.  As long as they have this ability to think from first principles not saying, "This  is done this way because we did it this way before." I also should probably  say this feels way more complex. This is why I've written about it extensively in  two articles. One's called the Art and Science of Hiring. You'll get a link to  that.

如果你有一群博士，有多少是有经验的博士，有多少是新鲜的？有多少人来自你所在的区域，有多少人完全来自这个地区。多样性的每个方面都会有所帮助，因为它们会带来不同的观点。只要他们有能力从最初的原则思考，而不是说，“这是这样做的，因为我们以前是这样做的。”我也应该说这感觉要复杂得多。这就是为什么我在两篇文章中对此做了广泛的描述。其中一个叫做“雇佣的艺术和科学”。你会得到一个链接的。

It's on our website too. One's called Gene Pool Engineering. There's a third one  I actually wrote when Peter Boyd joined us, which talked about what boards should and  shouldn't do. Boards will do more damage to start-ups than anything else I know. That's  why I don't go to board meetings anymore. Applying tradition just really hurts. When you're  looking for an investor, it's not money, it's help in building this team that's way  more important. Way, way more important to where you'll get to than anything around the  amount of money raised, or the valuation, or other things. We should come back and  talk about founder equity also.

它也在我们的网站上。一个叫做基因池工程。当彼得·博伊德加入我们的时候，我写了第三篇文章，讨论了董事会应该做什么，不应该做什么。董事会对初创企业的损害比我所知道的任何事情都要大。所以我才不去参加董事会会议了。应用传统真的很伤人。当你寻找一个投资者时，更重要的不是钱，而是帮助建立这个团队。方式，更重要的是，在哪里，你将获得比任何有关的资金筹集，或估值，或其他事情。我们也应该回来谈谈创立者权益。

I spend a third of my time maybe, more time  on recruiting for our companies than any other single thing I do because of all  the things I've talked about.

我花了三分之一的时间为我们的公司招聘，比我所做的任何一件事情都要多，因为我已经谈到了所有的事情。

In fact, at start-up Grind, the interviewer asked me, he  said, Chamat was saying that you couldn't possibly spend that much time interviewing.

事实上，在刚起步的时候，面试官问我，他说，Chamat是说你不可能花那么多时间面试。

I said,  "That's because he just fundamentally has a different belief system than me." I do, and  it's most of what I do.

我说，“那是因为他和我有着根本不同的信仰体系。”我知道，这是我所做的大部分事情。

I'll go to 100 LinkedIn resumes by myself on  a weekend if I'm looking for a critical hire for a company. A few people  can make or break a company.

如果我想找一家公司的关键员工，我会在周末自己去看100份LinkedIn简历。几个人能创造或破坏一家公司。

Anu Hariharan: Yeah, and I think you've talked about this too, which would be helpful here. The  CEO's job initially is to be the chief recruiting officer. Can you elaborate on what  is the founder's role, and how should they be thinking. Especially because we see a  lot of start-ups where they say, "Oh, I'm looking for VP of sales," and they  write down all the skills, but then they forget about all the elements needed for  what it takes to lead in a start-up.

是的，我想你也讨论过这个问题，这在这里会很有帮助的。首席执行官最初的工作是担任首席招聘官。你能否详细说明创始人的角色，以及他们应该如何思考。尤其是因为我们看到很多初创公司说，“哦，我在找销售副总裁，”他们写下了所有的技能，但是他们忘记了领导创业所需要的所有要素。

Vinod Khosla: Yeah, so let's come back to this notion of functional hiring. Let me talk about  what founders need to do. A founder's role, and when I was a founder I  spent probably 40% of my time recruiting. You're much better off hiring the people who  can code than coding-
Anu Hariharan: Was it throughout the life of the start-up, or did it change?
Vinod Khosla: Both in the beginning and throughout the life of the start-up.

维诺德·科斯拉：是的，让我们回到功能性雇佣的概念。让我谈谈创始人需要做什么。一个创始人的角色，当我还是创始人的时候，我大概花了40%的时间来招聘。和编码相比，雇用能编码的人要好得多-Anu Hariharan：是在创业的整个生命过程中，还是它改变了？维诺德·科斯拉：无论是在创业初期还是在整个创业生涯中。

I think it's true  of very early, mid stage, and later stage companies, and really good founders do most  of that because if you can hire the people, you should generally be able to  hire the people who can do any given job better than you can.

我认为非常早、中期和后期的公司都是这样的，而真正优秀的创始人大部分都是这样做的，因为如果你能雇用这些人，你通常应该能够雇佣那些能够比你更好地完成任何一项工作的人。

I tell  founders about their role, if there's any job you can hire for, modular money, which  we can talk about, you should hire for that role so you don't have to  spend time. Founders have some unique characteristics. They have this entrepreneurial spirit, this first principle  thinking, this attitude says, "Yes, done this way but why?" This why, and I recommend  a back by Simon Sinek called Start With Why.

我告诉创始人他们的角色，如果有任何工作你可以雇佣，模块化的钱，我们可以谈论，你应该雇用那个角色，这样你就不用花时间了。创始人有一些独特的特点。他们有这种创业精神，这种第一原则思维，这种态度说：“是的，是这样做的，但为什么呢？”这就是为什么，我推荐西蒙·辛尼克(SimonSinek)的书名为“从为什么开始”。

It's a really good book about  questioning everything, and yet staying true to your vision even if it's not precise.

这是一本关于质疑一切的好书，但即使它不精确，也要忠于你的愿景。

If  you're doing something radically new, it's going to be ambiguous, and very, very few normal  people are comfortable with that ambiguity. Let's charge ahead in this direction even though we  don't know precisely what the business model is, or why, or what will take. That  leadership is a founder's role. That's something it's almost impossible to hire for.

如果你正在做一些全新的事情，它将是模棱两可的，而且很少有正常人会对这种模糊感到舒服。让我们朝着这个方向前进，尽管我们不清楚业务模式是什么，为什么，或者需要什么。领导是创始人的角色。这几乎是不可能雇佣的。

If you  hire senior executive from another company, there's zero chance you'll have that. They can systematize  what you are doing, and get much more boost to your efforts, but not without  your vision. That's a founder's role.

如果你从另一家公司聘用高级管理人员，你就没有机会做到这一点。他们可以系统化你正在做的事情，并得到更多的推动你的努力，但不是没有你的远见。这是创始人的角色。

I call it leadership.

我称之为领导。

It's a belief system in  the face of ambiguity.

这是一个面对歧义的信念系统。

It's figuring it out kind of attitude, assembling a diverse team.  I was very lucky as a young founder.

它正在找出一种态度，组建一个多元化的团队。作为一个年轻的创始人，我很幸运。

I loved awesome people.

我喜欢很棒的人。

I didn't know  why we hired many of the people, but if you look at it the first  15 people we hired at Sun probably started more than 10 companies worth a billion  dollars later one. We hired Carol Bartz who became CEO of Yahoo. We hired Eric  Schmidt who became CEO of Google. We hired all these. We hired Bill Joy.

我不知道为什么我们雇佣了这么多人，但如果你看一下，我们在Sun招聘的前15名员工可能在一家公司成立了10多家公司，价值10亿美元。我们聘请了卡罗尔·巴茨(CarolBartz)担任雅虎首席执行官。我们雇佣了埃里克·施密特，他成为了谷歌的首席执行官。这些都是我们雇的。我们雇了比尔·乔伊。

In  fact, Bill Joy became a founder six months after we started. We should come back  to it.

事实上，比尔·乔伊(BillJoy)在我们开始创业的六个月后成为了创始人。我们应该再谈一谈。

I so badly wanted him. We made him founder retroactively. Anything is okay  in this game of assembling great talent.

我太想要他了。我们让他追溯到创始人。在这个聚集天才的游戏里，任何事情都是可以的。

I loved learning from great people, so we  hired great people.

我喜欢向伟人学习，所以我们雇佣了很棒的人。

In retrospect, that was why we were successful, and I started believing  company becomes the people you hire. By the way, Andy Bechtolmsheim was a student in  Margaret Jacks Hall, not far from here, where the computer science department used to be.  He had licensed his technology to six companies. The only one that succeeded with it  is us, and we started two years after some of the other companies had licensed  the technology, but we got all the people.

回想起来，这就是我们成功的原因，我开始相信公司会成为你雇佣的人。顺便说一句，AndyBechtolmsheim是玛格丽特·杰克斯大厅的一名学生，就在离这里不远的地方，计算机科学系曾经就在这里。他已将他的技术授权给六家公司。唯一成功的就是我们，我们是在其他一些公司批准这项技术两年后开始的，但我们拥有了所有的人才。

I hounded Andy until he dropped his  PhD to join me.

我一直缠着安迪，直到他放弃了博士学位才加入我的行列。

I hounded Bill Joy until he dropped his PhD to join  us. Both of them dropped their PhDs when they thought they were six months from  finishing. Selling is also a founder's job, and it's gut-wrenching because you don't know you're  going to be successful, and you're trying to convince somebody to drop their PhD.

我一直缠着比尔·乔伊，直到他放弃了博士学位才加入我们的行列。当他们都认为离毕业还有六个月的时候，他们都放弃了博士学位。销售也是创办人的工作，这让人很痛苦，因为你不知道自己会成功，你想说服别人放弃他们的博士学位。

It's  gut-wrenching. Hiring is gut-wrenching. Or you're convincing them to drop a comfortable job at Google  and join you, so many stories. Anyway, back to what were we talking about.

真是令人痛心。招聘真是令人痛心。或者你说服他们放弃谷歌的一份舒适的工作，加入你的行列，这么多故事。不管怎么说，回到我们刚才说的。

Anu Hariharan: Yeah, no, I think just to ...

是的，不，我想只是.

I know before you have said in one  of the points that when it comes to selling for hiring, no means maybe, and  then maybe means yes.

在此之前，我知道你曾在其中一点上说过，当涉及到为招聘而销售时，没有可能，也可能意味着是。

Vinod Khosla: Yeah, I have my favorite. When a candidate says no I convince them it's a  maybe. Then I'll spend enough time. Once they say maybe, then my job is to  say, maybe is a yes. Always say a no is a maybe, and a maybe  is a yes.

维诺德·科斯拉：是的，我有我的最爱。当候选人说不的时候，我说服他们这是一个可能。那我就会花足够的时间。一旦他们说可能，那么我的工作就是说，也许是肯定的。总是说“不”是“可能”，“也许”就是“。

It doesn't matter if you fail. Occasionally when you succeed it's what  ... People give up on recruiting way too early and way too quickly.

你失败了没关系。偶尔当你成功的时候.人们过早地、过快地放弃了招聘。

I just  hound people.

我只是猎犬的人。

Anu Hariharan: I wanted to touch upon founders equity because I know you brought that up twice.  How should, especially when you're trying to attract ... You want to build a great  team, and a great team is a magnet for other people to join the company.  How should founders think about equity especially in the early hires?
Vinod Khosla: Yeah, I find by and large, and there are exceptions, plenty of them, founders keep  too much equity for themselves. They don't realize the following fact. Anybody they hire who's  exceptional will a year later figure out they want to start their own company, unless  they're a founder. You self-select for okay people, good people, not awesome people. My son's  starting a company, actually two companies, right now. He graduated last June from Stanford.

我想谈谈创始人的权益，因为我知道你提过两次。怎么做，尤其是当你试图吸引.你想要建立一个伟大的团队，一个伟大的团队是吸引其他人加入公司的磁石。创始人应该如何看待股权，尤其是在早期招聘中？维诺德·科斯拉：是的，我发现总的来说，也有例外，很多例外，创始人为自己保留了太多的股权。他们没有意识到以下事实。一年后，他们雇佣的任何一位杰出人才都会发现，他们想要创办自己的公司，除非他们是创始人。你自己选的是好人，不是很棒的人。我儿子现在开了一家公司，实际上是两家公司。他去年六月从斯坦福大学毕业。

I  convinced him that him and his co-founder should just take 15% each. Leave 15% for  a third founder, another 15% for three junior founders. Then a 20% pool after that.  They had this humongous pool. Because I fundamentally believe a company becomes the people it  hires I said, "You'll be able to hire great people." For one of his companies,  and I think this is public, if it's not, stop recording. He just hired for  one of his companies the VP of engineering of Quora. Why would that person join  a fresh graduate? Because, one, he helped define a fairly interesting large vision, but two  he had this huge pool. He's been talking to people who would take that kind  of thing, any of whom could start their own company. Let me invert it and  say when a team comes in to present to me, one of the questions I  ask mys in judging how good a team is, do they have expertise in all  the areas they need expertise, but the single most important question I ask. On this  team, if some of these people left and started a company, would I want to  invest in that company? If somebody has two people like that on their team, zero  chance I won't want to invest.

我说服他，他和他的联合创始人应该各拿15%。剩下15%留给第三位创始人，另外15%留给三位初级创始人。然后再加20%的游泳池。他们有一个巨大的水池。因为我从根本上相信一家公司会成为它雇佣的人，所以我说：“你将能够雇佣优秀的员工。”他的公司，我认为这是公开的，如果不是，停止录音。他刚刚为他的一家公司聘请了Quora工程副总裁。为什么那个人会加入一个刚毕业的人？因为，第一，他帮助定义了一个相当有趣的大视野，但第二个，他有一个巨大的水池。他一直在和那些愿意接受这类事情的人交谈，他们中的任何一个人都可以创办自己的公司。让我倒过来说，当一个团队来到我面前时，我问我的问题之一是判断一个团队有多好，他们是否在所有他们需要专业知识的领域都有专门知识，但这是我提出的最重要的问题之一。在这个团队中，如果这些人中的一些人离开并创办了一家公司，我会不会想在那家公司投资呢？如果有人有两个这样的人在他们的团队中，我没有机会不想投资。

Independent of whether I like the plan or not  because they're collecting great talent.

独立于我是否喜欢这个计划，因为他们正在收集优秀的人才。

If I could have great talent or a great plan,  I'd rather have great talent and a founder who loves great talent.

如果我能拥有伟大的人才或伟大的计划，我宁愿拥有伟大的人才和一个热爱伟大才华的创始人。

It's a great  way to judge a start-up is what kind of people do they hire? I told  Sam in the last YC batch there was two companies we made an offer to  if they hired in a critical area. They're both AI start-ups.

这是一个很好的方法来判断一个初创企业是什么样的人，他们雇用？我告诉山姆，在上一批YC，有两家公司，如果他们雇用在一个关键的领域，我们的出价。他们都是人工智能初创公司。

If they left equal  co-founder equity for an AI start-up.

如果他们为一家人工智能初创企业留下同等的联合创始人股权。

I said, "I'll write you a check at the  evaluation you want, if you do that.

我说，“如果你这样做的话，我会在你想要的评估时给你写一张支票。

If not, then we don't want to invest."  One of them took that offer, and the other one didn't, which is okay.

如果没有，我们就不想投资。“他们中的一个接受了这个提议，而另一个没有，这没关系。

I  really, religiously, believe this idea. You get a Bill Joy or Andy ... They weren't  experienced. They were graduates, but they made the whole company. Eric Schmidt wanted to come  work for them. By the time we had first 10 people, we were getting so  many resumes. Everybody wanted to join us because we had so many awesome people other  than ... Me and McNealy were just fresh business school graduates, we didn't count.

我真的，虔诚地相信这个想法。你有比尔·乔伊或者安迪.。他们没有经验。他们是毕业生，但他们创造了整个公司。埃里克·施密特想为他们工作。当我们有了前10个人的时候，我们收到了这么多的简历。每个人都想加入我们是因为我们除了.我和麦克尼利只是刚毕业的商学院毕业生，我们不算在内。

I  always say, and I keep telling my son, "Hire some magnets." I tell him, "Nobody's  going to come join you just to work with you." Think about who you could  get that everybody wants to work with. That's how you'll hire the numbers 10 through  30 or 50. A rough rule of thumb I use on equity, I think Sam  has said at least 10% of the company should be reserved for the first 10  hires.

我总是说，我不停地告诉我的儿子，“雇些磁铁。”我告诉他，“没有人会来和你一起工作。”想想你能得到谁，每个人都想和谁一起工作。这就是你雇佣数字10到30或50的方法。我用在股权上的一个粗略的经验法则，我认为山姆已经说过，至少10%的公司应该保留给前10名员工。

I actually think that numbers too low.

实际上我觉得这个数字太低了。

I flip it around and say when  a company's 50 the founders should have a third of the common. Their direct reports  should have, so if there's five or six direct reports, should have a third of  the common, and everybody else the engineers, the worker bees, should have a third of  the common.

我翻过来说，当一家公司50岁的时候，创始人应该拥有三分之一的公司制。他们的直接报告应该有，所以如果有五到六个直接报告，应该有三分之一的普通报告，而其他每个人-工程师，工人蜜蜂，应该有三分之一的普通报告。

If you do that, people don't leave. People stay with you. Now, Sam  has a good blog post on how to attract a team. One of those is  growth. Growth is always a metric, but you can't always close that. When things get  tough, when you run into trouble, why will people stay? They'll stay because they believe  in your value system. What are you going after, the reason you're defining? Define an  interesting, ambitious enough vision.

如果你那样做，人们就不会离开。人们和你在一起。现在，Sam有一篇关于如何吸引团队的好博客。其中之一就是增长。增长总是一个衡量标准，但你不能总是这样。当事情变得艰难，当你遇到麻烦时，人们为什么要留下来？他们会留下来因为他们相信你的价值体系。你在追求什么，你定义的原因是什么？定义一个有趣的，雄心勃勃的愿景。

If your vision is just to make money, the people at  the first dip will say, "Oh, I joined to make money. Doesn't look like it."  They'll leave. They won't stick with it. The single biggest reason people stick with a  company is because they have people around them who are really awesome that they can  learn from, who are better than them, everybody should feel that way. That's a great  culture to set up, and every time I've seen that done, it's turned out really  well. The gene pool engineering article I mentioned, I put together in 1995 when we  were starting Juniper. Nobody had ever challenged Cisco, and nobody wanted to challenge Cisco, and  no customer in the world wanted to buy TCP IP routers, none for the public  network.

如果你的愿景只是赚钱，第一次下跌的人们会说：“哦，我加入是为了赚钱。看起来不像。”他们会离开的。他们不会坚持的。人们之所以坚持一家公司，最大的原因是因为他们身边的人都很棒，他们可以从中学习，比他们更好，每个人都应该有这种感觉。这是一个伟大的文化建立，每次我看到这样做，它的结果真的很好。我提到的基因库工程文章，是我在1995年创办Juniper的时候写的。没有人挑战思科，也没有人想挑战思科，世界上没有客户想要购买TCP IP路由器，也没有为公共网络购买TCP IP路由器。

It sounds incredulous, but go look up articles from 1995. Not a single carrier,  AT&T, which as Pack Bell, what is now Verizon, all said they would never introduce  TCP IP in the public network. We defined this large vision. We built this process  of engineering the gene pool of the company, and everybody got excited about changing the  course of their internet, from what was ATM, and nobody remembers this. A very, very  senior executive told me when I was looking at investing in this, they would never  use TCP IP. This is what telecom carriers do, this is how traditional wisdom goes,  but you need this awesome team to change that. Pradeep Sindhu, who's was one of  the great founders I run into, not only built a great company, but it actually  changed the trajectory of the protocols in the internet in my view. We would have  ended up with something else. Most likely, ATM if all the carriers had their way.  Every single carrier from Deutsche Telekom in Europe to AT&T here had decided they would  go with ATM not TCP IP. So, great missions, great people to work with, all  that is why you want people in your team.

这听起来令人难以置信，但去看看1995年的文章。没有一家运营商AT&T，也就是现在的Verizon，被称为Pack Bell，他们都说他们永远不会在公共网络中引入TCPIP。我们定义了这个大视野。我们建立了这个公司基因库的工程过程，每个人都对改变他们的互联网进程感到兴奋，从自动取款机(Atm)开始，没有人记得这一点。一位非常资深的高管告诉我，当我考虑投资这个项目时，他们绝不会使用TCP IP。这就是电信运营商所做的，这就是传统的智慧，但你需要这个了不起的团队来改变这一点。普拉迪普·辛杜，他是我遇到的伟大的创始人之一，他不仅建立了一家伟大的公司，而且在我看来，它实际上改变了互联网协议的发展轨迹。我们会有别的结果。最有可能的是，如果所有的运营商都有办法的话，自动取款机。从欧洲的德国电信(DeutscheTelekom)到美国电话电报公司(AT&T)，每一家运营商都决定使用ATM，而不是TCP IP。所以，伟大的使命，伟大的工作人员，这就是为什么你想让人们加入你的团队。

Anu Hariharan: Got it.

明白了。

I want to touch upon functional hiring because I think it is a  component of building a great team as well, and too often founders tend to prioritize  a lot on skills for a product level, versus really figuring out the complete package  or the fit of the person. Can you talk about how should a founder think  about hiring?
Vinod Khosla: Yeah, so let me answer that question, but later if you're a founder, you're a  technologist, or have a technical breakthrough, or a big idea, and you start a company,  and you need a VP of marketing or you need a CFO. We should come  back to the question, and I covered this in my art of hiring, of how  you judge somebody's a good VP of marketing or a good CFO because the first  thing you have to realize is you're not qualified to judge. Knowing what you don't  know is critical and one of the most important things a founder does is decide  whose judgment to trust on what topic, and not just ask their friend because they  may not be qualified.

我想谈谈功能性招聘，因为我认为这也是建立一个伟大团队的一个组成部分，而且创始人往往倾向于把很多技能放在产品水平上的优先考虑，而不是真正想出完整的方案或合适的人选。你能谈谈创始人应该如何考虑招聘吗？维诺德·科斯拉：是的，让我来回答这个问题，但是后来如果你是一个创始人，你是一个技术专家，或者有一个技术突破，或者一个伟大的想法，你就会创建一家公司，你需要一个营销副总裁，或者你需要一个首席财务官。我们应该回到这个问题上，我在我的招聘艺术中谈到了这个问题，你如何判断某人是一个好的市场营销副总裁还是一个好的财务总监，因为你首先要意识到的是你没有资格评判。知道你不知道的是至关重要的，而创始人最重要的事情之一就是决定谁的判断应该相信哪个话题，而不是仅仅问他们的朋友，因为他们可能没有资格。

In fact, founder's just hired their friends instead of gene pool  engineering a start-up, and that's wasting slots and talent too. Let me go back to  functional hiring. We can come back to this, otherwise I cover it fairly extensively in  my paper on hiring, how you interview population, how you judge them.

事实上，创始人只是雇佣了他们的朋友而不是基因库来设计一个创业公司，这也是在浪费时间和人才。让我回到官能型招聘。我们可以回到这个问题上，否则我会在我关于招聘的论文中详细介绍，你是如何面试人口的，你是如何判断他们的。

If you need  a VP of engineering, you can look at somebody who has managed an engineering project.  If you're a founder, especially an inexperienced founder with a big breakthrough idea in a  new space that nobody knows. You clearly need to build an engineering team and execute  on that. What you need more than that? Somebody who's going to go help you  evaluate all the pivots and changes in iterations in your plan. Let's say you hire  a VP of engineering who's good at that, a VP of marketing who is good  at marketing, a VP of sales good at sales, and a CFO, and they do  their job well, who's going to help you figure out what path to take? I  always say you need functions, but way more important while hiring those functional people, you're  getting something else whether you recognize it or not. You're getting somebody who is going  to participate in all the more critical decisions, even more critical than having engineering run  smoothly, which is which path should we take. Ask the following question. When I hire  a VP of engineering, how will it make my VP of marketing better? That's by  asking fundamental first principles questions. Elon Musk's book is worth reading because he knew so  little about building cars or about launching rockets. He made so many screwy mistakes that  could have been avoided, but if he had had all that experience and knowledge, he  wouldn't even have attempted what he did.

如果你需要一个工程副总裁，你可以看看谁管理了一个工程项目。如果你是一个创始人，特别是一个缺乏经验的创始人，在一个无人知晓的新领域有一个重大突破的想法。显然，您需要建立一个工程团队并在此基础上执行。你还需要什么？将帮助您评估计划中迭代中的所有支点和变化的人。假设你雇佣了一个擅长于此的工程副总裁，一个擅长营销的营销副总裁，一个擅长销售的销售副总裁，以及一个财务总监，他们的工作做得很好，谁能帮你找出该走哪条路呢？我总是说你需要功能，但更重要的是，当你雇佣那些有功能的人时，你会得到一些别的东西，不管你是否认识它。你会让一些人参与所有更重要的决策，甚至比让工程顺利运行更关键，这就是我们应该走的道路。问以下问题。当我聘请一个工程副总裁时，它将如何使我的营销副总裁做得更好？这是通过提出基本的基本原则问题。埃隆·马斯克的书值得一读，因为他对制造汽车或发射火箭知之甚少。他犯了那么多本来可以避免的错误，但如果他有那么多的经验和知识，他甚至不会尝试他所做的事情。

I'd rather have somebody like Elon Musk who  just fundamentally asks a lot of questions. Why are we doing it this way? Not  that we've done it this way for 50 years at GM. Remember, GM spent more  money, more time, and started earlier trying to an electric vehicle called the EV1. Elon  with no experience by asking a lot of questions, and adapting rapidly as he screwed  up, he got to a place where Tesla is a much more interesting company than  GM today. When you look for that functional hire, realize you're also getting this other  thing, which is much more important. Look for how they think, how fast they change,  how much they become defensive when you challenge an idea versus saying, "Oh, why didn't  I think of that?" Or be much more brainstorm oriented. This horizontal hiring that you  get while doing functional, vertical hiring is much more important in a much more important  dimension, and by the way, most VCs don't look for it because they've not go  through building companies themselves. They give you bad advice. The number of times they say,  "Go get somebody with distribution channel expertise." I'd rather have somebody figured it out, and  not have a source inertia in this fluid, dynamic, evolving, thinking method in a company.  When you are hiring, more than anything, you are hiring a brain trusts, and they  happen to also have skills in doing functional jobs, but the brain trust is more  important than the functional job, and evaluating them is very tricky.

我宁愿有像埃隆·马斯克这样的人从根本上问很多问题。我们为什么要这样做？这并不是说我们在通用汽车已经这样干了50年了。记住，通用汽车花了更多的钱，更多的时间，并开始更早开始尝试一种电动汽车称为EV 1。埃隆没有经验，他问了很多问题，并迅速适应，因为他的错误，他到了一个地方，特斯拉是一个更有趣的公司比通用汽车今天。当你寻找职能人员时，要意识到你也得到了另一件东西，这更重要。看看他们是怎么想的，他们的变化有多快，当你挑战一个想法而不是说，“哦，为什么我没有想到这一点时，他们变得有多防御性了？”或者更倾向于头脑风暴。这种横向招聘是你在做功能性垂直招聘的过程中得到的，在一个更重要的层面上要重要得多，顺便说一句，大多数风投公司并不是这样想的，因为他们自己还没有经历过公司的建设。他们给了你糟糕的建议。他们说“去找一个有分销渠道专业知识的人”的次数。我宁愿有人搞清楚，而不是在公司里这种流动的、动态的、不断发展的思维方法中有一种源惯性。当你招聘的时候，最重要的是，你雇佣的是一个大脑信托公司，他们碰巧也有做功能性工作的技能，但是大脑信任比职能工作更重要，评估它们是非常棘手的。

It's tricky because partly  you don't know how to evaluate somebody outside of your area of competence. Two, you  call a VP of marketing at Cisco, I don't mean to pick on Cisco, but  it's a good company to pick on, they will look at marketing very, very different  than what a start-up needs. They'll give you the wrong advice. Going through, and this  is where the tricky part comes, not being overly swayed by titles or positions, understanding  why people did certain things, and how thoughtful were they about it. What did they  do that wasn't usual? Is very hard.

这很棘手，因为在一定程度上，你不知道如何评估超出你能力范围的人。第二，你叫思科的营销副总裁，我不是有意挑思科，但这是一个很好的公司，他们会看营销非常，非常不同的一个初创企业的需要。他们会给你错误的建议。这是最棘手的部分，不受头衔或职位的影响，理解人们为什么做某些事情，以及他们对此有多深思。他们做了什么不平常的事？很难。

It's also tricky to go back to this  question of how you evaluate people. Most experienced interviewees know how to give you the  right answers. They're going to fool you. You ask somebody, what did you do here?  They'll retroactively look at what was great about the strategy, and say, "I did this."  I've actually had people pitch me on why they did Sun's marketing strategy. Being very,  very indirect, kind of a list of questions in my paper on hiring, the way  you get to the bottom. Give you one example.

回到你如何评价人们的问题上，这也是一个棘手的问题。大多数有经验的受访者都知道如何给你正确的答案。他们会骗你的。你问别人，你在这里做了什么？他们会追溯到战略的伟大之处，然后说：“我做到了。”实际上，我让人们向我推销他们为什么要做Sun的营销策略。非常，非常间接，在我关于招聘的论文中，我列出了一系列的问题，这是你找到最底层的方法。举一个例子。

I'll ask the same thing three  different ways.

我会用三种不同的方式问同样的问题。

I'll say at the beginning, "What do love doing? What are you good  at?" Somebody say something. Then while talking later about a job I say, "What did  you do really well there?" If those two don't coincide, if somebody's making it up,  they won't.

一开始我会说，“爱做什么？你擅长什么？”谁说点什么。后来，当我谈到一份工作时，我说：“你在那里做得好吗？”如果这两个人不重合，如果有人在编造，他们就不会。

I'll ask that question three different ways. Third time I might ask, "If  you were to join this company, what would you think your strength would be?" I've  asked this question three different ways in three different contexts. People who are making it  up will make up different answers. People who fundamentally have the truth will give the  right answer. Then I might at the end of the interview ask, "What would your  boss say about you?" Now I've asked the same question a fourth time.

我会用三种不同的方式来问这个问题。第三次，我可能会问，“如果你加入这个公司，你认为你的力量会是什么？”我以三种不同的方式在三种不同的情境中问了这个问题。编出来的人会想出不同的答案。从根本上讲，掌握真相的人会给出正确的答案。在面试结束时，我可能会问：“你的老板会怎么评价你？”现在我已经问了第四次同样的问题了。

If they  say something, then I'll say, "Hey can I get your last performance review that your  boss did?" If they say no, I know they don't want to share their performance.  I have a 100 tricks like this I use. You can never rely on the  direct answer you get in interviewing somebody.

如果他们说了什么，我就会说：“嘿，我能得到你老板做的最后一次业绩评估吗？”如果他们拒绝，我知道他们不想分享他们的表现。我用了100个这样的技巧。在面试中，你永远不能依靠你得到的直接答案。

It's the trickiest thing. Then it's good to  get together with each other and see what each person looked at. One other danger  in hiring, I find if I'm rushed today, and I'm interviewing somebody, I'll evaluate them  differently than if I'm doing it over coffee on a Saturday morning. Other thing to  keep in mind, depending upon how your day went, or what mindset you're in, how  you evaluate people changes. For critical positions, I'll interview the same person three times at  three different days just so I'm not biasing myself because humans including yourself and myself  are really biased. There's so many pitfalls. This is why doing a start-up is so  hard. Anyway, I'll let you ask more questions. Sorry, I keep rambling.

这是最棘手的事。然后，在一起，看看每个人都看了些什么，这是很好的。招聘中的另一个危险是，如果我今天很匆忙，而且我要面试一个人，我会对他们的评价和周六早上喝咖啡的时候不同。另外要记住的是，取决于你一天的进展情况，或者你所处的心态，你如何评价人们的变化。对于关键职位，我会在三个不同的日子里对同一个人进行三次面试，这样我就不会有偏见，因为包括你和我在内的人类都是有偏见的。有很多陷阱。这就是为什么创业这么难的原因。不管怎样，我会让你问更多的问题。抱歉，我一直胡说八道。

I could go  on for six hours.

我可以继续六个小时。

Anu Hariharan: I'll ask one more question, and then I'm going to open it up for Q  and A.

我会再问一个问题，然后我将把它打开给Q和A。

I know in that paper you have a lot of questions, and we  will circulate that for interviews, but you also make the point even if you follow  all those processes mistakes are inevitable. At least one third of the time, the hires  don't work out. What in your view is the most common reason why the hires  don't work out, and how should a founder handle that because sometimes start-ups wait too  long to fix it.

我知道在那篇论文中你有很多问题，我们会在面试中传阅，但你也要指出，即使你遵循这些过程，错误是不可避免的。至少在三分之一的时间里，这些员工都是不成功的。在你看来，最常见的原因是招聘人员不成功，以及创办人应该如何处理这些问题，因为有时初创企业等得太久才能解决。

Vinod Khosla: Look, if somebody wants a job, in the interview their job is to fool you.  Question is are they better at fooling you, or are you better at getting behind  the words? I find after hiring many, many people, and I probably do hundreds of  interviews every year, I have a success rate of about 65%.

维诺德·科斯拉：听着，如果有人想要一份工作，在面试中，他们的工作就是愚弄你。问题是，他们是更善于愚弄你，还是你更善于理解这些话？我发现，在雇佣了很多人之后，我每年可能会面试数百次，成功率约为65%。

I'm wrong, and I  find most people with less experience are wrong more often because usually if you're a  young founder the people you are interviewing are more experienced than you at fooling you.  It is a game. We then talk about culture and other things. There's those reasons  why candidates fail, but there's really not be able to get behind the scenes and  dig deep. One, you ought to plan on that happening.

我错了，我发现大多数经验较少的人错得更多，因为通常情况下，如果你是一个年轻的创办人，那么你面试的人在愚弄你时比你更有经验。这是一场游戏。然后我们讨论文化和其他事情。候选人失败的原因是有原因的，但实际上无法在幕后深入挖掘。第一，你应该计划好这一切的发生。

I always tell my teams,  "If you want four people on your team, hire six. Even make up a title  you don't need." Yeah, so I always over hire because you're never successful. Hiring is  a long process. To hire a critical person in a start-up whether it's a technology,  critical technologist or a senior executive, can easily take six months are longer, and then  they take six months coming up to speed.

我总是告诉我的团队，“如果你想在你的团队中有四个人，雇佣六个人，甚至编一个你不需要的头衔。”是啊，所以我总是多雇你因为你从来没成功过。招聘是一个漫长的过程。在初创企业中雇佣一个关键的人，无论是技术、关键技术专家还是高级管理人员，都可以轻松地花上六个月的时间，然后他们就需要六个月的时间才能跟上进度。

If you made a mistake, you lose  a year. They will have hired other crappy people during that time.

如果你犯了错误，你会损失一年。在这段时间里，他们会雇用其他差劲的人。

It's very, very  expensive. This is why you really need to watch new people. You need to really  evaluate how they're doing, and this is where I think board members and investors should  be much more about assisting a venture.

非常昂贵。这就是为什么你真的需要关注新的人。你需要真正评估他们的表现，这就是我认为董事会成员和投资者应该更多地帮助一家企业的地方。

I never call myself a venture capitalist.

我从不称自己为风险投资家。

I  say a venture assistant. Even our tag line for our firm says venture assistant.

我说是风险助理。风险助理说，就连我们公司的挂牌线也不例外。

I  like to do all this, and spend all my time doing all this.

我喜欢做这一切，把我所有的时间都花在做这件事上。

I never  go to VC functions.

我从来不去VC函数。

I never go to financial conferences.

我从不参加金融会议。

I just spend my time  with founders and people they are trying to higher. By the way, it's a lot  more fun, and you learn a lot more, and get excited about it. You should  over hire. Flip side, if you find somebody great, make up a title and hire  him. Two things, no great talent is worth getting away because you don't have a  slot. Make up a slot. They will pay for themselves. The flip side, with few  exceptions, and there are some, a great talent is never too expensive to hire.

我只是把时间花在创始人和他们想要更高的人身上。顺便说一句，它更有趣，你学到了更多，并为此感到兴奋。你应该多雇点人。另一方面，如果你发现一个伟大的人，编造一个头衔并雇用他。两件事，没有伟大的天赋值得离开，因为你没有一个插槽。补个槽。他们会为自己付出代价的。另一方面，除了少数例外，而且也有一些，一个伟大的人才永远不会太昂贵的雇用。

I've  gone to all kinds of ridiculous things. We were trying to hire an exec today,  and I was arguing with another VC this morning.

我做过各种各样可笑的事情。我们今天想雇一个主管，今天早上我和另一个风投公司吵了起来。

I said, "His company offered him  this. They're about to go public. Why don't we guarantee him the first $15 million  out of this start-up. Give him a preference over the preferred stock.

我说：“他的公司给了他这个。他们要上市了。为什么我们不向他保证，从这个初创公司中拿出第一笔1500万美元。给他一个比优先股更多的优先权。”

I'll go to  any lengths for great talent. Nobody heard of putting of 15 million of preference for  an employee above the preferred stock that the investors' money.

我会不惜一切代价去寻找伟大的人才。没人听说过将1500万的员工优先于投资者资金的优先股之上。

I've done this more than  once. Couple of things around that, the flip side is plan for failure and evaluate  new people. One other thing, you can also when you hire somebody, and I want  to stop, try and assimilate them. People can fail because they're the wrong fit, but  people can also fail because you didn't assimilate them well.

我已经做过不止一次了。围绕这一点，另一方面是计划失败和评估新的人。另一件事，你也可以，当你雇用一个人，我想停止，试着吸收他们。人们可能会失败，因为他们是错误的适合，但人们也可能失败，因为你没有很好地吸收他们。

If you have somebody really  experienced in a business, and you hired somebody from that business, they can advise you  on how to assimilate this person. You might think of what they're doing differently than  somebody who knows that person or that business. Getting advice on how to assimilate people  into your business because they are going to be different. They are the diversity you're  trying to be, and you don't want to be too uniform. Getting help in assimilating,  getting lots of advice in how to make them successful as opposed to reacting because  they're acting so differently, and doing things so differently, that's bad too. Then, of course,  if you make a mistake, you have to be quick. Your investors, good investors, can  help you do that. That to me is the principle value good investors bring. Anyway,  let's open it up to questions for a few minute.

如果你有一个真正有经验的人在一家企业，你雇用了一个人从该业务，他们可以建议你如何吸收这个人。你可能会认为他们所做的事情与认识那个人或那个生意的人不同。获得关于如何让人们融入你的事业的建议，因为他们将是不同的。它们是你想要成为的多样性，你不想变得太统一。在同化的过程中得到帮助，在如何使他们成功方面获得很多建议，而不是因为他们的反应是如此的不同，而且他们所做的事情也是如此的不同，这也是很糟糕的。然后，当然，如果你犯了一个错误，你必须迅速。你的投资者，好的投资者，可以帮助你做到这一点。对我来说，这是好投资者带来的主要价值。不管怎么说，让我们把问题打开几分钟。

Speaker 3: I have question. So, you talk about Elon Musk with the space rocket and Tesla,  and then why do you think why do you think one of them it requires  good domain expertise, and then one of them doesn't?
Vinod Khosla: Well, different questions. One, I think Stripe hired really awesome teams.

演讲者3：我有问题。所以，你用太空火箭和特斯拉谈论埃隆·马斯克，然后你为什么认为其中之一需要良好的领域专长，而其中一个却不需要？维诺德·科斯拉：嗯，不同的问题。第一，我认为Stripe雇佣了非常棒的团队。

In fact, the Stripe  co-founder that is now running OpenAI. He hired somebody so strong even though he was  a college drop out, Patrick, he hired awesome people around him.

事实上，现在正在运行OpenAI的Stripe联合创始人。他雇了一个很强壮的人，即使他是个大学毕业生，帕特里克，他雇佣的人都很棒。

I don't think TheraNest  did this early. There's a culture thing we didn't talk about, and culture's very important.  I think good companies acknowledge their problems. Say, "What do we need to solve it?"  TheraNest early on tried to hide their problems. They didn't encourage discussion around their problems.  I think that was the difference.

我不认为TheraNest这么早就做了。有一件我们没有谈论的文化问题，文化是非常重要的。我认为好的公司承认他们的问题。说，“我们需要什么来解决这个问题？”一开始就试图掩盖他们的问题。他们不鼓励围绕他们的问题进行讨论。我想这就是区别所在。

I think Elizabeth has learned a lot.

我觉得伊丽莎白学到了很多。

I think  if she was to do another start-up, she'd do much, much better. Sometimes in trying  to show the outside world you're a great start-up, you tend to not acknowledge your  weaknesses. That's a danger.

我想如果她再做一次创业，她会做得更好。有时候，在试图向外界展示你是一个伟大的创业家时，你往往不承认自己的弱点。这很危险。

In fact, most start-ups spend way more time on their assets,  not their liabilities. Your liabilities can kill you faster than your assets can make you  successful. You need to spend time because you're a cohesive group generally when you're starting  out, you tend to have group think, so you tend to lose sight of your  risks. You want to encourage that behavior of asking a lot of ... That's culture.  We won't go too much into culture today, but establishing the right values, why people  are here, what the mission is, what kind of culture. Then other people made the  point having good goodies in your lunch menu isn't culture. Allowing dogs in your workplace  isn't culture, though I love dogs. Culture is about fundamental values and how you behave  and what you encourage. The more people at every level in the organization can ask  questions, the more you will identify your risks sooner, have a more constructive culture, and  the more likely you will to increase success. Let me finish that by saying one  other thing. Sam, said something else that I really like. He said start-ups are a  pass fail game.

事实上，大多数初创企业花更多的时间在他们的资产上，而不是他们的负债上。你的负债比你的资产能让你成功更快地杀死你。你需要花时间，因为你是一个有凝聚力的团队，当你开始工作的时候，你倾向于集体思考，所以你倾向于忽略你的风险。你想要鼓励这种问很多.这就是文化。我们今天不会过多地探讨文化，而是建立正确的价值观，为什么人们会在这里，任务是什么，什么样的文化。然后，其他人认为，在你的午餐菜单上吃好东西并不是一种文化。允许狗进入你的工作场所并不是一种文化，尽管我喜欢狗。文化是关于你的基本价值观、你的行为和你鼓励的东西。组织中每个级别的人越多地提出问题，你就越能更快地发现自己的风险，拥有更有建设性的文化，你就越有可能增加成功。让我说完另一件事。萨姆，我还说了些我很喜欢的话。他说，初创企业是一种传球失败的游戏。

I think it puts everything I've been saying in context.

我想它把我说的每句话都放在上下文里。

I like  to say start-ups are not about dilution they're about the probability of success. They're much  more distilled than you think.

我想说的是，创业并不是为了淡化，而是关乎成功的可能性。它们比你想象的要高得多。

If you can increase the probability of success by hiring  great people, by asking a lot of questions, by finding your risks early by having  people surface problems, you're going to increase your probability of success. Either your successful or  you're not, and so it's about probability. People worry way too much about dilution, and  not giving more equity to a co-founder, or new hire who may need to be  made a co-founder.

如果你能通过雇佣优秀的人，提出很多问题，通过让人们发现你的问题来及早发现你的风险，你就能增加成功的可能性，你就会增加成功的可能性。不管你成功与否，都是关于概率的。人们过于担心稀释，而不把更多的股权给联合创始人，或者是需要成为联合创始人的新员工。

I'm seeing a lot of this in the AI start-ups now. They're  AI start-ups, but they don't hire the AI talent because the average AI person at  Google, machine learning person, is making the median income I think is like $750,000 cop.  What are you going to do to get that person? You can pretend you can  do without that, but you're fooling yourself. Sorry, there was a question there.

我在人工智能的初创公司里看到了很多这样的事情。他们是人工智能初创公司，但他们不雇用人工智能人才，因为谷歌的人工智能人员，机器学习的人，平均收入的中位数，我认为是75万美元的警察。你要怎么做才能抓到那个人？你可以假装没有那个就行了，但你在自欺欺人。抱歉，有个问题。

Speaker 4: You touched on this earlier, and you spend your Saturdays going through resumes. For early  stage, can you quickly go through like 30 seconds or a minute what you look  for if you're hiring let's say probably technical or like a early business dev person?
Vinod Khosla: What do I look for?
Speaker 4: Yeah.

演讲者4：你早些时候提到过这个问题，你把周六的时间都花在简历上。在早期阶段，如果你招聘的是技术人员或者是早期的商务开发人员，那么你能快速完成你想要的30秒钟或一分钟的工作吗？维诺德·科斯拉：我要找什么？演讲者4：是的。

Vinod Khosla: First, people who can think originally about their area. Whatever their area is.

维诺德·科斯拉：首先，那些最初能思考自己所在地区的人。不管他们的区域是什么。

Speaker 4: Specifically, how do you see that on LinkedIn.

演讲者4：具体来说，你在LinkedIn上是怎么看的。

If you were looking on LinkedIn-
Vinod Khosla: LinkedIn, it may be ... Sometimes if I ask somebody, "What interesting papers have you  read in your area of expertise?" If it's narrow diversity, tells me one thing.

如果你在看LinkedIn-Vinod Khosla：LinkedIn，可能是.有时候，如果我问某人：“你在你的专业领域读过什么有趣的论文？”如果是狭隘的多样性告诉我一件事。

If  it's broad diversity, it's one of my 100 questions.

如果它是广泛的多样性，这是我的100个问题之一。

I'll ask a direct question like  what books have you read.

我会问一个直接的问题，比如你读过什么书。

It tells you how they think, and that's critical to  a start-up in addition to knowing encryption algorithms. Annu, tell me when to stop.

它告诉你他们是怎么想的，除了知道加密算法之外，这对于创业来说也是至关重要的。安努，告诉我什么时候停下来。

I'll  keep asking.

我会一直问。

Anu Hariharan: Probably the last one.

可能是最后一个。

Speaker 5: For an early stage start-up that's bootstrapping, do you see any value in leveraging technical  advisors or an advisory board?
Vinod Khosla: There is always value in leveraging technical advisors in advisory board. What's important is to  get their opinions, but not respect it too much. This is again this quandary, which  is hard. You want them to surface the issues, but you as the founder using  first principles. One, I say, "Do I believe this or not? Or, how much should  I weigh this versus some other things?" That's the critical part. That's the hard part.  That's what makes entrepreneurship hard.

演讲者5：对于早期创业来说，你认为利用技术顾问或顾问委员会有什么价值吗？维诺德·科斯拉(Vinod Khosla)：在顾问委员会中利用技术顾问总是有价值的。重要的是听取他们的意见，但不要太尊重它。这又是一个难题，这是很难的。你想让他们暴露问题，但你作为创办人使用的是第一原则。第一，我说，“我信不信？或者，我应该用多少来衡量这个和其他一些东西？”这是关键的部分。这正是难点这就是创业难的原因。

It is a lot of fun, but it's really hard  too.

这很有趣，但也很难。

I have a great presentation.

我有一个很棒的演讲。

I came up with the title in 1986, and  still on our website, the entrepreneurial rollercoaster where the highs are high and the lows  are low, and the lows are really low in every start-up.

我在1986年想出了这个标题，现在我们的网站上还提到了创业过山车，在这里，每一家初创企业都会出现高、低的情况。

Anu Hariharan: Yes, that's true. Thank you so much, Vinod, for taking the time.

哈瑞哈拉：是的，那是真的。谢谢你，维诺德，你花了这么多时间。

Vinod Khosla: Thank you, everybody.


谢谢大家。
