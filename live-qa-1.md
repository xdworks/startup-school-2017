# Live Office Hours with Yuri Sagalov and Sam Altman


Sam: Good afternoon. Today we're going to do something different. One of the things that we've  learned at Y Combinator is that one of the best ways to learn about startups  is to watch other startups get advice, and so we're going to do live office  hours, which we've done a few times before in this class, three or four times.  We'll try to do three companies each time. This is Yuri, also works at Y  Combinator, and going to do this with me, and we're going to just give advice  to three startups. You have to be very brave to do this, so I'm very  thankful for the startups that have agreed to do this. These are some of the  people that are taking the course online. We'll just get going. Do you want to  tell us ... First, do you want to introduce yourselves?
Sarah: Yes. Does this work? I'm Sarah, and this is my co-founder Andrew. We're building Canny.  Canny helps teams collect and manage feedback from their users. Essentially what it is, is  teams can integrate our product into their website or mobile app, and that lows their  users to post and vote on feedback.
Sam: Is it live?
Sarah: Yes.
Andrew: It is live.
Sam: How many websites have integrated?
Sarah: We launched our NVP about a month ago on Product Hunt. That was pretty good  traffic. We have 25 paying customers, so those are people who have either integrated or  are using us in a certain way. We've got maybe around 500 companies from the  Product Hunt launch.
Sam: That's great.
Sarah: Yeah.
Sam: How much are you charging?
Sarah: It's a range. On the low end we have a $2 plan, which was our  alternative to freemium.
Andrew: Cheapium.
Sarah: Cheapium. It goes from 19.49, 1.29, from there. It's really early, and we're trying to  integrate on this and figure out what our best price point is, which is probably  one of our main challenges right now, I think.
Yuri: Go ahead.
Sam: How'd you even arrive at the first set of numbers to test?
Sarah: The $2 one was kind of special. We were flip-flopping between freemium and cheapium, and  I think that was a good decision because it narrowed down our potential customers by  a lot, and we figured that people who are not going to pay us anything  were never going to pay us anything.
Sam: How many of the 25 customers are on the $2 plan?
Sarah: Maybe ...
Andrew: Seven.
Sarah: Yeah.
Sam: That's a good .
Yuri: Really.
Sam: That's great.
Sarah: Yeah.
Sam: What's the other most popular plan? That's the 19?
Andrew: 19.
Sarah: 19. We limited our $2 plan very heavily, so it's really people who are a  solo founder, probably no revenue ...
Andrew: Who have less than 100 users.
Sarah: Yeah.
Yuri: What do you get with the pricing? I think I looked at your website, it's  how many users you have?
Sarah: Right. Right now we're charging by how many end users you have. That was kind  of our proxy to how much value the company was going to get from our  product. This is kind of a challenge, especially because we can't particularly tell how many  users they have. We're iterating on this as well.
Sam: What do people really love about this? Why do they use your product and not  one of the many other services to accomplish the same goal?
Andrew: Yeah. There's a lot of different values that you get out of posting and voting  on features. One of them is, there's a lot of transparency, so you keep your  users in the loop. A lot of current feedback solutions is email or live chat,  where the user sends an email and then the company says, "We'll pass it on  to the team," is what inevitably happens. Then the user doesn't really know, "Did my  voice get heard?" We've heard both from teams and from users that this is a  great experience, their users are happy, they know what feedback their users are giving, versus  email and live chat, which takes just a ton of time to process all these  conversations.
Yuri: Of the people that are using it, what's the average number of questions that have  been posted on it so far?
Andrew: Average number of questions? What do you mean by that?
Yuri: People request, or something else that they're voting on, do you know, of the 25  paying customers, how many on average have had questions posted?
Sarah: It really depends on how many end users they have, and also how well they've  implemented our tools. If it's less discoverable they're going to less feedback, and so we've  been trying to help that by giving them design advice. Our top team probably has  300 posts. The thing about this versus email is that you might get ... If  a post has 100 votes, you might get 100 different emails, and so we help  you save time by responding to all those 100 people at once, instead of send  individual emails back and forth.
Sam: Do you feel like you've gotten to the point where you have a product that  some people really love? At this point, if so, do you think you're at that  point first?
Andrew: Yeah. I think we have a sliver of product market fit, where some people are  extremely happy with our product and we kind of know the next steps we need  to do to expand that by 10x, to address a larger portion of the market.
Yuri: What are the steps?
Andrew: Integrations with other SAS services, like Intercom, Slack, Zapier, and then a better answer on  mobile.
Sam: Is the biggest challenge you face now just figuring out how to grow and scale  this, do you think, or is there still a lot of product work? Other than  integrations that are meant to drive growth, is there still a lot of product work  before you really want to scale?
Andrew: There's some product work for sure. I think the core product is pretty good, but  it takes a while for our leads to get stuck on our product, because they  have to integrate into their product, so it's a pretty big investment.
Sam: How easy is to integrate?
Andrew: It's pretty easy. It's really easy. It takes half an hour to an hour, is  what we see developers spending time on. It's just, I think we need better onboarding  to convince them that this is worth doing, and so I think right now our  funnel's pretty leaky. That's what we're working on, is onboarding.
Yuri: What's the biggest value? Your biggest user has 300 questions, or a couple hundred questions?
Andrew: Several hundred.
Sarah: that there's votes.
Yuri: What's the biggest value that they see out of it? What do they tell you?
Andrew: it's hard because a lot of our value add is very diverse. One thing is  customer satisfaction, another thing is product management, what you want to work on. Another thing  is having a transparent road map, so keeping your users in the loop. There's just  all these different values, there isn't one core value, which is why it's kind of  hard to ...
Sam: That sounds like a mistake.
Andrew: A mistake.
Sam: Almost everyone who says, "We have all these different values," and, "There's all these different  reasons people like it," it's really nice if you can figure out how that all  abstracts into one message, and then build all of the company's sales and marketing and  PR around ...
Yuri: One message.
Andrew: One core value product?
Sam: This is what it's about, rather than saying, "There's six different reasons to use the  product!" I think one of the things ... When you say you have a problem  with people integrating you, it's not that hard, it's just not high enough on their  priority list, and there's a few ways to solve this. One thing that works is  to send people around and say, "We're going to send an engineer to come help  integrate with you." It's not that the company can't help do it, it's just that  otherwise you'll always be at the bottom of their back log. That's one way. The  other is if it's like, their CEO tells them to go do it, or they  themselves decide, "I've got to go do this, it's really important." That almost never comes  from a bunch of disparate messages that are a bunch of nice-to-haves. It's like one  thing, which is maybe in this case ... It's some version of user feedback, and  how if you don't have this you will be iterating more slowly than your competitors.
Andrew: Or that your users will feel like you're more engaged with them, if listening to  the features they want they'll ...
Sam: I have two big questions. One, I think back-of-the-envelope math is really important, and I  worry that this is the kind of business where, if you're mostly selling to startups,  and you're selling at, let's say on average, 100 bucks ... Is it a month  or a year?
Andrew: A month.
Sam: A month. How big can this business actually get off of this model? Have you  thought about that?
Andrew: We have thought about it. I think just doing napkin math, I think with a  startup you usually want to arrive somewhere around 100 million annual revenue. For us, right  now it's looking like we'd be going for 10,000 people paying us $100 a month.
Sam: Does that feel doable?
Andrew: Maybe it's 100,000. Yeah.
Yuri: There's the difference there.
Andrew: I think the number ...
Sam: I think it is 100,000 for 100 million.
Andrew: Yeah, 100,000, sorry. I think the number of companies that need feedback, and the number  of websites and mobile aps, is increasing, and ...
Yuri: Do you feel there's 100,000 ... Part of it is, do you feel you're going  to have to own like 50 percent of the startup market to get there, or  do you feel there's enough demand out there that you can actually get to the  market without dominating the entire thing?
Andrew: Right.
Sarah: Right. As an aside to this, I think we've been getting a lot of feedback  that we can actually charge a lot more, and so I think there's a few  features that we can build out that will help a lot, including analytics.
Yuri: Do you use your own product?
Sarah: Yeah, definitely. That's a good way to figure out if it's providing value.
Sam: Again, maybe the answer is to charge a lot more, maybe the answer is that  there are 100,000 startups, maybe the answer is you need to tweak the product in  a way that, you can appeal to a lot of people outside of startups, but  I think startups almost never just do the swag on this early enough, and it  really informs product strategy.
Sarah: Right.
Sam: Which also informs my next big question. This feels like the kind of service that  is interchangeable, and that a lot of people can build a similar service, and if  one company uses product A and another company uses product B, there's no reason for  a third company to prefer A or B. There's no network effect, there's no monopoly.  I can imagine ways that you could build one of those into the product, where  there are sort of cross-company incentives to use yours, but what is your plan to  be a monopoly and not another SAS business that just gets competed down to zero  margins?
Sarah: That's a good question.
Sam: If you don't have an answer yet, it's also fine to just say, "We don't  know yet."
Sarah: Yeah. Our strategy so far is to go after influencers. These are including people who  have users that would also use our product. For example we go after open-source projects  and tools like Optimizely for example.
Yuri: You give it free to open-source projects?
Sarah: Open-source projects are free, yeah. As an alternative to GitHub and GitHub issues, and they're  bringing in a lot of people, I think that's a good move for us. So  far I think our strategy is really to put our product in front of the  public, it's powered by Canny, and that's kind of where we're at with it.
Sam: do you have any thoughts about this?
Andrew: One little thought. I think one thing that we've found so far is that there  are other products on the market that do this, and during our Product Hunt launch  we got people coming from those products wanting to use us, and the thing that  they mentioned liking about us more is design and simplicity. I honestly feel like our  product, out of all the products in the market right now, is the best designed  and the simplicity for exactly what we do.
Sam: I believe you that that's true, but here's the problem. Every startup, I'd say one  out of three startups I meet with says, "We're like this other thing, except we're  better designed, we're more beautiful, and we're simpler to use." It may be true that  you are, I believe that it is, but someone else can come do that some  thing to you.
Yuri: More importantly, or not necessarily more importantly, but often times you start off very simple,  and then you start having to build features because you see that they're missing, and  then somebody else comes in and says, "We're now the simplest."
Sam: In any case, it's really good. You've built a product that people love, you've got  them to pay for it, and you have a growth channel you believe will work.  That puts you in the top few percent of all startups, so that's great. But  this is the time where your biggest problem now, part of that, the one thing  you should be thinking about, is what can I do early to build a product  that, A, can eventually address a very large market, and B, how can I build  some sort of monopoly? How can I build something where, because this company uses my  product, this other company is going to be more likely to use it as well?  Design and simplicity, though everyone says it, and it's kind of true, is usually not  a long-term win. At some point, and it may just be that once your integrated  into a company you're impossible to rip out, and then you're going to win the  mine share war. That could be it.
Sarah: I think that's what we're seeing actually.
Sam: A better answer, though, would be if there's some way that you can use aggregated  data or learnings across all companies, or aggregate users ... The kind of users that  leave feedback on products tend to do it across all the products they use, so  there's probably a very small percentage of users that give feedback, and they do it  across all the products. My sense is that somewhere in there, there is a strategy  to build a monopoly, but you want to figure out what that core is and  build that into the core of the product, so that you have a long-term defensible  strategy.
Sarah: Yeah. This is actually very interesting, because we probably started at more of an aggregate  level where everyone could feedback about anything. That was hard because companies weren't onboard first
Sam: Yeah, that doesn't feel right either.
Sarah: Yeah. Right now we've decided to go this other way for now, but there is  a possibility that one day, we're connecting all the users, if they post on multiple  products that use Canny we can connect all those people, so maybe there's some potential  there eventually, yeah.
Sam: Why is it named Canny?
Sarah: Canny was really hard to find. We went through many different names, but a core  part of our product is the subdomain, and we didn't want to use something that  was "Get This," or "Try This," "Use this".
Andrew: Short and sweet.
Sarah: Yeah, so something short and sweet. We got Canny.io, so it's not the worst, but  it's not the best.
Sam: You can still change it's not too late.
Sarah: Yes. We can still change.
Yuri: It thought it was a play on uncanny.
Sarah: Yeah. Actually they're kind of different. It means to make good judgment, so I think  that kind of plays in at well.
Yuri: If it's working, if people remember it, if they spell it right, that's all good.
Sarah: Yeah.
Yuri: Anything else you'd like to talk about?
Sarah: Yeah. In general I think, to your point about broad use cases, after our Product  Hunt launch, it came out with a lot of people using Canny for different reasons,  and so I think focusing on-
Sam: Is there one reason that's surfacing?
Sarah: Yeah. The top one is feature requests, which is what we requested. Also I think  pricing is one of the big ones, figuring out what our main value is, and  that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to isolate that one thing, to especially  market it on our home page. How do we pull people with that one value.
Sam: Feature requests don't sound quite as good as user ... I don't know. I would  be willing to ... This is the place where I believe in AB testing. I  don't believe in it for everything, but in terms of messaging and communication, and what  are those four words you put big on your website when people come there for  the first time, this is the place I believe in, AB testing. If feature requests  are really what people want, then great.
Sarah: Yeah, just put it right up front.
Sam: If that's the thing that's working, that's at least a candidate for the right answer.
Sarah: Right.
Sam: All right, we should move on to the next group. Thank you so much.
Sarah: Okay. Thank you.
Andrew: Thanks.
Sam: Thank you. Thank you.
Sarah: Thank you.
Sam: Thank you. Hey, I'm Sam.
Chris: Chris.
Yuri: Hey, Yuri.
Chris: Hey. Chris.
Yuri: How's it going.
Sam: By the way, I don't know what any of these companies do ahead of time.  Live reaction from me. You want to introduce yourself?
Chris: Hi everybody, my name is Chris Beltran, I'm the CEO and founder of Tuml. What  we do is, we connect home owners, private property owners, and all sorts of parking  lot owners, to our app. Which our app does is, it aggregates, essentially, their parking  spaces, lets them lease it out. The owners are able to make some passive income,  and the parkers are able to just go to their parking spot whenever they want  to easily and quickly. This tool was meant for specifically San Francisco, highly industrialized cities,  in which people need to park easier and faster rather than circling the block.
Yuri: It's like Airbnb parking.
Chris: Essentially yes, it is.
Yuri: Yeah, I've wanted to see something like this happen for a long time, because it  feels like, in urban cities like San Francisco, there's just not enough street parking.
Chris: That is, but right now more of the issue is, is this a perceptive problem,  or is this an actual problem?
Yuri: Are you live in the city right now?
Chris: We are not live in the city. We are currently building out the NVP right  now.
Yuri: Got it.
Chris: Unfortunately my cofounder's not here, she's actually taking a vacation through Mexico. I think she's  doing some traveling. Mind you guys, I'm not a solo founder, I do have a  cofounder.
Yuri: That's all right. Have you been talking to home owners in the meantime? Are they  willing to rent out their parking spots?
Chris: You know what, the funny thing is, I am actually hitting the ground running, and  I'm physically going out to these homes and/or private parking lots, and pitching to them  my idea and saying, "Hey, why don't you use our platform, this is what it's  going to look like, and I'm representing our mockups to essentially say, "This is the  platform that you would essentially be using."
Yuri: What do they tell you?
Chris: More often than not they say, "This is awesome. Why haven't anybody else created this?"
Yuri: Are they willing to say, "I'm ready to pay ..." Or, would they pay you?  No, you would pay them to ... You would to a rough share with them,  right?
Chris: Correct. Essentially, the percentage of sales that occur when the commuter parks in their parking  space will collect 15 percent, they collect 85 percent.
Yuri: Can you sign them up ... Part of the thing for you is that when  you launch in a city you're going to want as much critical match as for  a parking spot.
Chris: Correct, yeah.
Yuri: Are they willing to sign up and say, "My parking spot is yours the moment  you're ready"?
Chris: Currently what we're doing is, we're creating lists and we're pitching the idea to them,  so essentially what we're trying to do is, we're trying to curate all these home  owners and private property owners throughout San Francisco that apply to, pretty much that play  with San Francisco standards, because you cannot park or moped over onto the sidewalk. Obviously  there's some things that we have to double check to make sure that they're completely  legal.
Yuri: Sure.
Chris: Otherwise what we're doing is, we're collecting data from them. Yes, they are more than  willing to sign up with us.
Yuri: When do you think you'll launch?
Chris: I pretty much projected to launch within six months, and-
Yuri: Why so long?
Sam: Yeah.
Chris: Why so long.
Yuri: What about six days?
Chris: I would love to build this out in six days, but currently I'm not a  technical founder, or a technical person.
Yuri: Is your cofounder?
Chris: My cofounder is technical. She has the tools and resources and clout to build this,  essentially, but she's on vacation. Wish she was here.
Yuri: When is she back?
Chris: She should be back within the week.
Yuri: Six days after that.
Chris: I know. I would love to push this.
Sam: One of the things that's really hard is, you're putting this product of yourself out  there when you launch a startup, and no one wants to do it until they  feel like it's really good. In six months the world will look entirely different, and  every good idea you have, someone else has. Now a lot of people are going  to hear about this, because we're talking about this.
Chris: Don't steal my idea.
Sam: Hundreds of thousands of people.
Chris: All of you don't steal it. NDAs for all of you.
Sam: Speed and execution really matter. You could tell 10 million people the idea, and probably  all of them would be busy with their own things, but a few of them  will be interested at least, and there's this issue of speed, and how quickly you  can build and iterate. Especially in a marketplace, there is a big first mover advantage.  Even if it's not the version you want, my most important piece of advice to  you would be to get this launched really quickly in an ugly first version, and  then you'll learn so much about how to build a better version that you can  go from there. It's great that you're talking to customers, that is clearly the number  one thing to go do, and getting people signed up so that you have inventory,  but I would think about how you bring the launch in, even if it's a  soft launch that you're embarassed about, by a lot.
Yuri: Yeah, especially if the problem is acute enough. If it's something that people really struggle  with, finding parking spots, they won't care how pretty the app is, or how ugly  the app is, as long as they can find a parking spot. Having something live,  even if it's just a website wrapped in a little icon ...
Sam: In one neighborhood.
Yuri: Yeah.
Chris: That's literally what we're doing, is we're targeting certain neighborhoods. There's neighborhoods, I'm sure you've  been to San Francisco multiple times.
Yuri: I live there.
Chris: You live there, obviously. Haight district is one of them, which is severely impacted, nine  times out of 10, even during the week ...
Sam: How do you know?
Chris: I've been there physically and had a checkboard out, and checking the times, and stand  there for eight hours a day. But there are times when it does free up  a little bit, but for the most par it's-
Sam: I understand how you're going to get the parking places onboard, which is I think  the harder half of the marketplace, but you still need people to want to park.
Chris: Correct.
Sam: How are you going to get those people?
Chris: What we're going to do is, we're going to reach out to people during festivals.  There's tons of festivals, there's Outside Lands, there's some that go on in Island, even  though that's out of our reach, but there's many that happen around Golden Gate Park,  there's Beta Breakers, there's tons of festivals that we're going to be pitching this around,  or some type of theme, or some type of festival, some type of ball game.
Sam: I worry that those, A, don't happen frequently enough, and B, those are people who  are not looking for parking super regularly in the city. It would be interesting if  you could figure out a way to find people for whom this is truly a  hair-on-fire problem that drive to the city every day and have to park, or live  in the city and don't have a parking place. That does not strike me as  the most urgent need, or the best way to find people who are really feeling  this problem every day, which there are a lot. This is a great problem to  be solving. I would think about other strategies to find a lot of people. The  festival thing, I worry there aren't enough festivals and there aren't enough people at those  to have this as a regular ongoing problem. You want the people who are going  to be daily or at least weekly users of this, and I bet you can  come up with better ways.
Yuri: I think if you're feet on the ground and actually surveying the place, I would  actually ask the people who are parking, "Why are you here?"
Chris: That's exactly what I'm doing.
Yuri: So what's the feedback? Are they working there?
Andrew: Nine times out of 10, people are either commuting into the city, so they're people  people that are not living in the city, obviously, because a lot of people who  live in the city don't necessarily own a car, so there's-
Yuri: Right, but they're commuting for what? Are they commuting for work?
Chris: They're commuting for work, and sometimes they're just commuting to do some contract work. They've  got a come to the city every so often, there's people that come in for  meetings, a whole host of reasons that they come in.
Sam: These people are driving today and parking today, maybe they'll do it more if it's  easier, but can you put signs in the parking lot, in the parking spaces, that  say, "To park here, download this"?
Chris: Yeah. Essentially just ...
Sam: That would work.
Chris: When that time comes in which we do have a product launch, I'm going to  create maybe little signs at first. Something cheap just to get started, maybe laminated or  whatnot, to put it on those places where it needs to be. It's designated .
Sam: Right. You need something, because in a lot of cases it is an impulse buy.  They're going to be looking for parking, they didn't find the street parking, and now  they're ready to buy whatever it is that you're giving them.
Chris: Yeah.
Sam: I have a general thought for you about this kind of marketplace. Airbnb is a  really good business, because if you own a space and you're renting it out, you  can only put it on basically one platform, if you're going to use the instant  book feature, and if you're a guest, you really care if you get these particular  house or this particular house. They're not interchangeable. Ride sharing, if you're a driver you  can drive for any service, you can turn the apps on and off, and if  you're a passenger you don't really care which car you get in. It's really nice  if you can somehow have the former kind of marketplace, where there's not just perfect  substitution and everyone is switching between each service depending on price. If you can do  something with ... I think this is actually a very big and important insight about  parketplaces that most people miss. If you can do something where people can only list  their space on your marketplace because you're going to have around-the-clock instant booking or something,  that would be really important to figure out early, and a very valuable tweak that  doesn't sound that big, but is actually a huge difference to the long-term viability of  the business.
Chris: I think that's a good take on it. Right now, as far as the 24-hour  booking and whatnot, I want to give the property owners or home owners the ability  to set their own times.
Sam: Sure.
Chris: Sometimes maybe some owners or property owners, we'll just say like Wells Fargo, they set  theirs a little bit later after business hours is closed.
Yuri: Do you think that you'll be able to get businesses to give up their parking  spaces though?
Chris: I would love to reach out to businesses to give up their parking spaces as  well.
Yuri: Interesting. I was thinking that this is more around home owners or people who have  extra spaces on their own, but businesses could be really interesting. It's a very different  sale now, because now you really have to go and convince whoever the property manager  is, or somebody else, to actually do it.
Chris: Correct.
Yuri: Go ahead.
Sam: Sorry, just one thought here, which is I would pick one of them in the  beginning, because you won't be able to sell to both.
Chris: Yeah. I especially wanted to be able to focus on residential and private lots first,  and then start slowly building out.
Sam: Do you have any sense yet for pricing?
Chris: Yes. I pretty much wanted to model this after the meters in San Francisco, and  right now the meters are all timed. Sf Park actually did a survey in which  they increased metr pricing similar to variable based pricing. That's what we're going to pretty  much mimic. Essentially we want to be competing with the meters themselves for residential. For  private lots obviously we're going to be competing with private lot prices, so we're just  going to base our model off of the model that San Francisco has already done.
Sam: People will be able to park, I assume, as long as they want and the  property owner is .
Chris: As long as the property owners set their times to say eight to five, they  can park eight to five and it'll be on a hourly rate.
Sam: What's the legal situation of this? I assume it's okay if it's private property.
Chris: It is legal. It is completely legal. I've looked into it, I've talked to an  SF law attorney specifically for San Francisco themselves, and I've asked them ... It's kind  of a funny question. The story goes, I called them up, I said, "My dad  is bed-ridden, he's not able to work, he doesn't get enough from social security, and  essentially he needs to make some passive income. Is it okay if we could rent  this space out to our neighbor?" They said, "As long as its his house, we  don't see any issue with it."
Yuri: Great. That's great.
Sam: Again, this is a really good idea. If you don't move fast it won't work.  I think it's always important as a startup to know what the number one biggest  problem in front of you is. For you, it's not shipping quickly. Just get this  working in one neighborhood as quickly as you possibly can, even if it's hacked up  and doesn't look that great.
Chris: Okay.
Sam: Any other questions you want to discuss?
Chris: I think that's it.
Sam: Great. I'm excited to try it out.
Chris: Awesome, thank you.
Sam: Thank you.
Yuri: Thank you.
Sam: Email us when you launch.
Chris: Awesome, thank you.
Yuri: How's it going. Yuri.
Emma: Philip.
Yuri: Nice to meet you.
Philip: I'm Emma.
Yuri: Yuri. Nice to meet you.
Philip: Nice to meet you.
Yuri: What do you guys do?
Emma: I'm Philip.
Philip: I'm Emma, and we're Moonlight Work. We're building a marketplace for software engineers and designers  to match up with companies who need them, 10 hours at a time.
Yuri: Specifically 10 hours at a time?
Philip: Yeah. I think we'll start with 10 hours at a time, but some companies want  more than that, and some people want more work, so if they want more time  they can have more time.
Sam: Is this launched, up and running?
Philip: We have a prototype up and running. We haven't had anybody else use it, but  both of us have both ...
Sam: Built projects for other people? That's a great way to start.
Philip: Yes. We started because we have this need ourselves.
Sam: Where do companies find you?
Emma: There's been a variety of them. Some of them have been friends of friends that  heard that we were doing contract work, and would come ein and assign jobs through  there. Another thing is, when we shut down our last company we open-sourced all of  the code, and so we had people coming in and paying us to deploy that  code for them on their own servers. They found us through Git Hub basically.
Sam: What kind of projects are people having you build so far?
Philip: So far it's a lot of people who have a very specific need, so they're  like, "I need an expert in this language," or an expert that knows how to  build this thing really well, and so they're looking for someone who, there's not going  to be much onboarding, they're just going to be able to jump in and do  a project.
Yuri: Why do they choose you instead of something like paperwork or TopTel or one of  the other outsourcing houses?
Philip: I think the biggest reason is because we're promoting it as something that experts are  working on, so these aren't just anyone in the world who wants to make $15  dollars an hour. This is someone who maybe works at a Google, or an Uber,  and they want to make a bunch of extra money on the side, but they're  really good at what they do.
Yuri: So you're gone have to actually curate these people.
Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah.
Yuri: Is that something you're already doing?
Philip: Yeah. That's what we're starting to do, and I think that's going to be the  biggest barrier for us, is being able to make sure that these people are really  quality workers.
Sam: How much are you charging for a 10-hour project?
Emma: The contractors set their own rates, and then we're handling the invoicing and charging 15  percent on top of that.
Sam: But true marketplace.
Emma: Correct, yeah.
Sam: Other than quality, given that so many people ... This is clearly a good business,  so a lot of people want in, a lot of people are already in it.  How will you become the marketplace where everyone goes for contracted engineering help?
Emma: I think we can speak from our own experience and say there have been times  in the past where we had student loans, and would've worked extra time every week  to pay them off, and there's not really parketplaces out there where people who want  over 50 or $70 per hour can find short term projects that they can do  on the side.
Yuri: That's true on the developer side, but how do you get the companies to come  to you and say, "When we need an expert we go to you guys"?
Emma: We're working on a couple different ways of matching, but I think the short of  it is that there are very specialized needs that some companies have, and it doesn't  even have to be core to the product. Sometimes it's like, "I need to set  up a development environment," or, "I want a landing page and our design team is  focused on an app," or something like that.
Yuri: I wonder if you want to become known as the place to go to for  a particular set of skills. Not for every expertise, but in the beginning it's just  like a particular set, where they just go to you and then you open up  additional verticals as you go.
Emma: For that we're looking at open-source projects. An open-source project is something where it takes  a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience, to understand the ins and the outs.  We tested that with our own open source projects, and got projects coming through there  and people signing up, and I think that matching people based on very specific open  source projects. Not saying Ruby programming language, but something like, the Mongo DB bindings for  Chef, or something very specific for that.
Sam: I think the insight of going after high-end work, and also for people who are  just looking for smaller pieces, is really good. I wonder if you could pick projects  that particularly need that, like projects that are harder to build and take less time,  sort of need specialized skills and are not the normal, "I just need people to  grind through this". That would strike me as a good initial focus.
Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Sam: What's the biggest problem in front of the company right now?
Philip: I think it's making sure that matching ... Obviously every marketplace has that issue, but  making sure that the people we have are worth what they're trying to get charged  for. Because we want to set a limit on how much people can charge for  hour so we will have higher-
Sam: Why?
Philip: We want people that are ... Minimum, sorry.
Sam: Oh.
Philip: We want people who are making more money per hour, because that's going to bump  up the quality of the work .
Sam: How much do you charge for hour?
Philip: We're both trying to charge about 150 an hour. We've had about 300 people sign  up so far, and we asked them what their hourly rate is, and it's usually  from about 70 to 200 per hour.
Yuri: The interesting thing is that it's not so much how much the people are charging,  it's more the perceived value on the other companies. If the company is saying that  these developers are worth the 150 or $200 an hour, they don't actually ... They're  happy to pay that, but you need to convince them that they're worth that money,  regardless of what the developers think they're worth.
Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Yuri: How do you do that? How do you convince a company that your developers are  worth $200 an hour if they can go somewhere for $25 an hour?
Philip: Yeah, and I think right now for the NVP, what we're trying to say is,  we are personally experts in these field, and we're making sure that the quality of  talent we have is up to that par. I think that we need to figure  out how we're going to scale that.
Sam: I also think, in addition to figuring out how to scale it, you need to  figure out how you're going to communicate it. The website really has to give across  the impression with testimonials from well-known customers for whatever, that these are the best people.  In terms of studying the prices, one thing that we have consitently seen is, when  you ask a user to set their price in the marketplace, if you give them  guidance, if you say, "Based on what you said, here's what we recommend," or, "Here's  the range we recommend," 85, 90 percent of the users will do that. If you  want to move people towards a specific range because you want people that are that  quality level, you can probably do that.
Emma: we did that. Our signup form says the average hourly rate is $70 per hour,  and it also says if you have you annual salary, that's about what your hourly  rate is. $100,000 per year is about $50 per hour.
Yuri: When do you think you'll have the first external developer live, that's not the two  of you?
Emma: We're working on basically building out invoicing right now, and so that'll be the next  week or two, probably.
Yuri: Can you do it more manually in the beginning? Just so that you can see  someone who's not you ... Because you obviously don't have invoicing.
Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Emma: We've been doing this ourselves, and there's just a lot of moving parts. There's sending  contracts back and forth, there's setting up bank accounts, there's getting companies to pay. When  we talk to the potential contractors who want to be on the platform, some of  their biggest concerns are, if I'm only working 10 hours per week, how much time  does it take to ramp up? Do I need to talk with the customer, and  how long does it take until I get paid?
Yuri: I would try and hack all of that way and just do it behind the  scenes manually right now, just to get the developers developing. Take all of the pressure  away from them so that they can just start interacting with a customer, and if  you need to manually process it do that. It's so important that someone who's not  you starts doing this on your perform.
Emma: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Sam: Then when they do, for the first ones especially, I would be super involved, just  to learn what the issues are. It may be that people aren't sure they're allowed  to do this, and they need help looking at their current employment contracts. It may  be that people need training to know how to engage with a customer, and how  much they should communicate. There are all of these things, many of which will surprise  you, and your guesses on many will be wrong, and the way you find this  out is to just, for the first, let's say, 20 users, go sit with them.  Or at least go talk to them all the time.
Yuri: I would at least think about it like, become their agent. If they were a  talent, and you were an agent for them, and you take care of everything for  them and answer all their questions.
Sam: Then you can just start building that into the product. In our experience, almost every  time when the people think they know where the break points are going to be,  or what they need to teach their users, they're almost always wrong. But you find  it out really quickly. You don't need a giant sample set to start hearing the  common concerns people have at every stage in the process, and then you just knock  those off one at a time. That is a way I think you can differentiate  from other coding talent parketplaces that don't do this. If you can figure out, if  you can be the person that makes it so that people who want a little  extra income but don't know how to go be a financer learn, and if that  becomes your reputation, that'll be a great way to get the top talent in the  field.
Yuri: One of the other, just an idea, which you may or may not want to  pursue, but if you want to be known as the experts in the field, see  if you can get any experts to actually use your platform through your network or  somewhere else. Or get someone who's well-known on a particular niche area and have them  sign up on your platform and do projects on your platform, if they're willing to.
Philip: Yeah.
Sam: What's your biggest problem right now?
Emma: Us personally?
Sam: The company.
Yuri: In this stage it's often one and the same.
Emma: Yeah.
Philip: I think it's more just getting the machinery up. If we were to manually take  payments, my big concern would be that 10 months down the line I'm going to  have to manually calculate 1099s, things like that.
Yuri: But you're not going to be 10 months down the line. You need to get  to the next two months.
Philip: Yeah.
Emma: I would say to go along with that, the reason we feel like we have  to have some sort of payment thing set up is because there's so many laws  around how you can pay people, and kind of the logistics of all that, and  paperwork that needs to be gone through. I think you're right, we need to do  those first couple ones to know what those are, but I think we're both apprehensive  of doing that.
Sam: Is there not just some other startup that you can use that handles invoicing really  well? It is complicated.
Yuri: Or just an accountant that can help you?
Emma: Yeah. Do you want to Stripe(inaudible)
Philip: Yeah. We're using Stripe Connect, which handles everything including the 1099s, but there's no turnkey  invoicing system built on top of that right now.
Yuri: Yeah, I get that. I really do get that, but I still feel like it's  so ... I get that feeling as a developer all the time, where it's like,  if only I have this built I'd be ready to go. But it's so much  more important to actually find out if you can ... Even if you have the  platform built, there's the chance that people won't start using it, and you'll only know  that when you do the non-scalable things. That's one of the things that we drive  home almost every single office hour session, which is just, do the non-scalable things. Do  it manually. Don't worry about 10 months down the road. 10 months down the road  it's a new company. It will look very different than it is today. Today it's  so important to just do the non-scalable things.
Sam: We're just talking about a small handful of users. You don't have to bring on  ... Everyone's like, "My problem is that if I do this non-scalable thing, 2,000 users  will sign up tomorrow ...
Philip: You should be so lucky.
Sam: Then we'll have to deal with them. That is not what's going to happen. It's  a slightly instinct to say that my big problem is that I haven't built this  one piece of the software yet, not that my biggest problem is how I'm going  to get those 2,000 users.
Philip: What we're focusing on basically is the invoicing right now. It's not people logging in  or anything like that, it's just being able to take your credit card or bank  account details right now.
Sam: Okay, well again, if that's the one thing you want to do, I would get  that to work .
Yuri: if you think you'll have it live in a week ...
Sam: My answer to that question about your biggest problem ... I'm not worried about the  fact that you'll be ability to get people that need developers to build something. There's  a lot of people that have an idea for an app. The thing that I  worry about is, every so often we've seen the idea of, "I'm going to get  these great developers to build stuff for other people," and it has been so hard  to actually do that, because the reasons that people have thought they're going to get  the developers, or the assumptions in, developer know how to do this well, have just  been so wrong. You still don't have ... You won't notice your own problems because  you've thought about this a lot. You may find out that invoicing doesn't even need  to built the way you think it needs to be built, because there's something fundamental  about the model that's going to change, but getting people you don't know, or you  don't know well, to build projects on a platform, I think that's a really important  step.
Philip: I agree with that. I would just add in that the idea came from a  prior company where we didn't have the time to go hire people, and we started  hiring part-time people, people who were friends of friends, things like that. We started to  do a lot of first-hand research like that.
Yuri: I think that's great. That's actually super important, because it means you have the pain  and you understand the pain. Sam and I are just kind of driving to the  same thing, which is, it's so critical to get someone who has nothing to do  with your previous business or your current core business, that wants to start using it.
Philip: That makes sense.
Sam: Any other issues you'd like to talk about? Any other questions?
Emma: I don't think so. I think that's our main thing that we know we need  to do right now.
Yuri: That's super exciting.
Sam: How did you decide about 15 percent as the amount to charge?
Emma: I think that's another thing we need to test out, but we feel like that's  a number that's not crazy for businesses to pay on top of something. My roommate  is a recruiter, and she gets 30 percent off of the top of all of  their salaries, but it's also enough for us to not have too many people to  start with, and be able to start testing things out.
Yuri: Is that a price that you're going to charge on top of the hourly rate,  or is that just going to be blended into the hourly rate?
Emma: Yeah. If somebody's $70 an hour, we'll add $15 dollars to that. Sorry, hundred dollars  an hour, we'll ad $15 to that.
Sam: This is a good problem to have in the future: what will prevent people from,  once they work with someone they like, just hiring them off the platform and not  paying you?
Emma: I think that's another thing that a lot of developers and designers have pointed out  to us, and I think we want to make sure that the tools inside of  the platform are keeping people there, so it's so easy for them to get work  and keep work, and they can do this on the side. Building internal tools that  allow people to work remotely and as contract workers will be another thing we're going  to focus on.
Philip: That's another thing that works well about the short-term projects.
Emma: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah.
Yuri: All right.
Sam: Very cool.
Yuri: Great, thank you very much.
Philip: Thanks.
Sam: Thank you.
Yuri: Nice to meet you.
Philip: Thank you.
Emma: Thank you.
Yuri: Yeah.
Sam: Format-wise, that was an experiment. Is that something you'd like us to do more of  in the class? Was that useful? More regular lectures? Yes? Yes? Some middle? Okay, we'll  do some more of that then. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you Yuri.
