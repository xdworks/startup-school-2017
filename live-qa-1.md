# Live Office Hours with Yuri Sagalov and Sam Altman

#与Yuri Sagalov和Sam Altman一起办公时间


Sam: Good afternoon. Today we're going to do something different. One of the things that we've  learned at Y Combinator is that one of the best ways to learn about startups  is to watch other startups get advice, and so we're going to do live office  hours, which we've done a few times before in this class, three or four times.  We'll try to do three companies each time. This is Yuri, also works at Y  Combinator, and going to do this with me, and we're going to just give advice  to three startups. You have to be very brave to do this, so I'm very  thankful for the startups that have agreed to do this. These are some of the  people that are taking the course online. We'll just get going. Do you want to  tell us ... First, do you want to introduce yourselves?
Sarah: Yes. Does this work? I'm Sarah, and this is my co-founder Andrew. We're building Canny.  Canny helps teams collect and manage feedback from their users. Essentially what it is, is  teams can integrate our product into their website or mobile app, and that lows their  users to post and vote on feedback.

山姆：下午好。今天我们要做一些不同的事情。我们在Y Combinator中学到的一件事是，学习创业的最好方法之一就是看其他创业公司获得建议，所以我们要做现场办公时间，我们以前在这门课上做过几次，三四次。我们每次都试着做三家公司。这位是Yuri，也在Y Combinator工作，并且和我一起做这件事，我们将给三家初创公司提供建议。你必须非常勇敢地去做这件事，所以我非常感谢那些已经同意这样做的初创公司。这些人都是在网上选修这门课的人。我们还是走吧。你想告诉我们.。首先，你们想自我介绍一下吗？莎拉：是的。这个有用吗？我是莎拉，这是我的联合创始人安德鲁。我们在建造Canny。Canny帮助团队收集和管理用户的反馈。本质上来说，团队可以将我们的产品整合到他们的网站或移动应用程序中，这就降低了他们的用户的发帖和反馈投票的水平。

Sam: Is it live?
Sarah: Yes.

山姆：是现场直播吗？莎拉：是的。

Andrew: It is live.

安德鲁：这是现场直播。

Sam: How many websites have integrated?
Sarah: We launched our NVP about a month ago on Product Hunt. That was pretty good  traffic. We have 25 paying customers, so those are people who have either integrated or  are using us in a certain way. We've got maybe around 500 companies from the  Product Hunt launch.

山姆：有多少网站整合了？莎拉：大约一个月前，我们推出了我们的NVP产品Hunt。交通很好。我们有25个付费客户，所以他们要么已经整合，要么正在以某种方式使用我们。我们有大约500家公司从产品猎头推出。

Sam: That's great.

山姆：那太好了。

Sarah: Yeah.

莎拉：是啊。

Sam: How much are you charging?
Sarah: It's a range. On the low end we have a $2 plan, which was our  alternative to freemium.

山姆：你要收多少钱？莎拉：这是个靶场。在低端，我们有一个2美元的计划，这是我们的自由选择。

Andrew: Cheapium.

安德鲁：印度。

Sarah: Cheapium. It goes from 19.49, 1.29, from there. It's really early, and we're trying to  integrate on this and figure out what our best price point is, which is probably  one of our main challenges right now, I think.

莎拉：印度。从那里开始，从19.49到1.29。现在还为时尚早，我们正试图在这方面进行整合，并确定我们的最佳价格点是什么，我认为这可能是我们目前面临的主要挑战之一。

Yuri: Go ahead.

尤里：来吧。

Sam: How'd you even arrive at the first set of numbers to test?
Sarah: The $2 one was kind of special. We were flip-flopping between freemium and cheapium, and  I think that was a good decision because it narrowed down our potential customers by  a lot, and we figured that people who are not going to pay us anything  were never going to pay us anything.

山姆：你是怎么得到第一组要测试的数字的？莎拉：2美元是有点特别的。我们在免费和廉价之间翻来覆去，我认为这是一个很好的决定，因为它把我们的潜在客户缩小了很多，我们认为那些不给我们任何东西的人永远不会付给我们任何东西。

Sam: How many of the 25 customers are on the $2 plan?
Sarah: Maybe ...

山姆：25位顾客中有多少人在2美元的计划中？莎拉：也许.。

Andrew: Seven.

安德鲁：七。

Sarah: Yeah.

莎拉：是啊。

Sam: That's a good .

山姆：这是个好消息。

Yuri: Really.

尤里：真的。

Sam: That's great.

山姆：那太好了。

Sarah: Yeah.

莎拉：是啊。

Sam: What's the other most popular plan? That's the 19?
Andrew: 19.

山姆：另一个最受欢迎的计划是什么？那就是19？安德鲁：19。

Sarah: 19. We limited our $2 plan very heavily, so it's really people who are a  solo founder, probably no revenue ...

莎拉：19。我们很大程度上限制了我们的2美元计划，所以真正的人是一个单独的创始人，可能没有收入.

Andrew: Who have less than 100 users.

安德鲁：只有不到100个用户。

Sarah: Yeah.

莎拉：是啊。

Yuri: What do you get with the pricing? I think I looked at your website, it's  how many users you have?
Sarah: Right. Right now we're charging by how many end users you have. That was kind  of our proxy to how much value the company was going to get from our  product. This is kind of a challenge, especially because we can't particularly tell how many  users they have. We're iterating on this as well.

尤里：你对价格有什么看法？我想我看了你的网站，你有多少用户？莎拉：对。现在，我们正在收取多少最终用户，你有。这是我们的代理，公司将从我们的产品中获得多少价值。这是一种挑战，特别是因为我们不能特别知道他们有多少用户。我们也在反复讨论这个问题。

Sam: What do people really love about this? Why do they use your product and not  one of the many other services to accomplish the same goal?
Andrew: Yeah. There's a lot of different values that you get out of posting and voting  on features. One of them is, there's a lot of transparency, so you keep your  users in the loop. A lot of current feedback solutions is email or live chat,  where the user sends an email and then the company says, "We'll pass it on  to the team," is what inevitably happens. Then the user doesn't really know, "Did my  voice get heard?" We've heard both from teams and from users that this is a  great experience, their users are happy, they know what feedback their users are giving, versus  email and live chat, which takes just a ton of time to process all these  conversations.

山姆：人们真正喜欢这个的是什么？为什么他们使用你的产品而不是许多其他服务中的一个来实现同样的目标？安德鲁：是啊。有很多不同的价值观，你可以从张贴和投票的功能。其中之一是，有很大的透明度，所以你让你的用户在循环中。很多当前的反馈解决方案都是电子邮件或实时聊天，用户发送一封电子邮件，然后公司说，“我们会把它传递给团队”，这是不可避免的。然后用户不知道，“我的声音被听到了吗？”我们从团队和用户那里都听说过，这是一个很好的体验，他们的用户很高兴，他们知道他们的用户给出了什么反馈，而电子邮件和实时聊天只需要花费大量的时间来处理所有这些对话。

Yuri: Of the people that are using it, what's the average number of questions that have  been posted on it so far?
Andrew: Average number of questions? What do you mean by that?
Yuri: People request, or something else that they're voting on, do you know, of the 25  paying customers, how many on average have had questions posted?
Sarah: It really depends on how many end users they have, and also how well they've  implemented our tools. If it's less discoverable they're going to less feedback, and so we've  been trying to help that by giving them design advice. Our top team probably has  300 posts. The thing about this versus email is that you might get ... If  a post has 100 votes, you might get 100 different emails, and so we help  you save time by responding to all those 100 people at once, instead of send  individual emails back and forth.

尤里：在使用它的人中，到目前为止，贴在上面的问题的平均数量是多少？安德鲁：问题的平均数量？您这是什么意思?尤里：你知道吗，在25位付费客户中，平均有多少人提出了问题？莎拉：这真的取决于他们有多少终端用户，以及他们实现我们的工具有多好。如果不那么容易发现，他们会得到更少的反馈，所以我们一直试图通过给他们设计建议来帮助他们。我们的顶级团队可能有300个职位。这和电子邮件的区别是你可能会.。如果一个帖子有100张选票，你可能会收到100封不同的电子邮件，所以我们可以帮你节省时间，一次回复所有100个人，而不是来回发送单独的电子邮件。

Sam: Do you feel like you've gotten to the point where you have a product that  some people really love? At this point, if so, do you think you're at that  point first?
Andrew: Yeah. I think we have a sliver of product market fit, where some people are  extremely happy with our product and we kind of know the next steps we need  to do to expand that by 10x, to address a larger portion of the market.

山姆：你觉得自己已经到了某些人真正喜欢的产品的程度了吗？在这一点上，如果是的话，你认为你是在第一个点吗？安德鲁：是啊。我认为我们有一小部分产品市场适合，其中一些人对我们的产品非常满意，我们知道下一步我们需要做的10倍，以满足更大的市场份额。

Yuri: What are the steps?
Andrew: Integrations with other SAS services, like Intercom, Slack, Zapier, and then a better answer on  mobile.

尤里：台阶是什么？安德鲁：集成其他SAS服务，比如对讲机、Sack、Zapier，然后在手机上找到更好的答案。

Sam: Is the biggest challenge you face now just figuring out how to grow and scale  this, do you think, or is there still a lot of product work? Other than  integrations that are meant to drive growth, is there still a lot of product work  before you really want to scale?
Andrew: There's some product work for sure. I think the core product is pretty good, but  it takes a while for our leads to get stuck on our product, because they  have to integrate into their product, so it's a pretty big investment.

山姆：你现在面临的最大挑战是如何成长和扩大规模，你认为，还是仍然有大量的产品工作？除了旨在推动增长的整合之外，在你真正想要扩大规模之前，还有很多产品工作要做吗？安德鲁：肯定有一些产品。我认为核心产品很好，但是我们的领导需要一段时间才能在我们的产品上站稳脚跟，因为他们必须融入他们的产品，所以这是一个相当大的投资。

Sam: How easy is to integrate?
Andrew: It's pretty easy. It's really easy. It takes half an hour to an hour, is  what we see developers spending time on. It's just, I think we need better onboarding  to convince them that this is worth doing, and so I think right now our  funnel's pretty leaky. That's what we're working on, is onboarding.

山姆：集成有多容易？安德鲁：这很容易。这真的很容易。它需要半个小时到一个小时，这是我们看到的开发人员花在上面的时间。只是，我认为我们需要更好的上机让他们相信这是值得的，所以我认为现在我们的漏斗漏水了。这就是我们正在研究的，正在上船。

Yuri: What's the biggest value? Your biggest user has 300 questions, or a couple hundred questions?
Andrew: Several hundred.

尤里：最大的价值是什么？你最大的用户有300个问题，还是几百个问题？安德鲁：几百。

Sarah: that there's votes.

莎拉：有选票。

Yuri: What's the biggest value that they see out of it? What do they tell you?
Andrew: it's hard because a lot of our value add is very diverse. One thing is  customer satisfaction, another thing is product management, what you want to work on. Another thing  is having a transparent road map, so keeping your users in the loop. There's just  all these different values, there isn't one core value, which is why it's kind of  hard to ...

尤里：他们从中看到的最大价值是什么？他们怎么跟你说的？安德鲁：这很难，因为我们的增加值很多都是多样化的。一件事是顾客满意，另一件事是产品管理，你想做什么。另一件事是有一个透明的路线图，所以让你的用户在循环中。所有这些不同的价值观，没有一个核心价值，这就是为什么它很难.

Sam: That sounds like a mistake.

山姆：听起来是个错误。

Andrew: A mistake.

安德鲁：一个错误。

Sam: Almost everyone who says, "We have all these different values," and, "There's all these different  reasons people like it," it's really nice if you can figure out how that all  abstracts into one message, and then build all of the company's sales and marketing and  PR around ...

山姆：几乎每个人都说，“我们有这么多不同的价值观，”而且，“人们喜欢它有很多不同的原因，”如果你能弄清楚这些信息是如何抽象成一条信息的，然后围绕着公司的所有销售、营销和公关，那真是太好了…

Yuri: One message.

尤里：一条信息。

Andrew: One core value product?
Sam: This is what it's about, rather than saying, "There's six different reasons to use the  product!" I think one of the things ... When you say you have a problem  with people integrating you, it's not that hard, it's just not high enough on their  priority list, and there's a few ways to solve this. One thing that works is  to send people around and say, "We're going to send an engineer to come help  integrate with you." It's not that the company can't help do it, it's just that  otherwise you'll always be at the bottom of their back log. That's one way. The  other is if it's like, their CEO tells them to go do it, or they  themselves decide, "I've got to go do this, it's really important." That almost never comes  from a bunch of disparate messages that are a bunch of nice-to-haves. It's like one  thing, which is maybe in this case ... It's some version of user feedback, and  how if you don't have this you will be iterating more slowly than your competitors.

安德鲁：一个核心价值产品？山姆：这就是它的意义所在，而不是说，“使用该产品有六个不同的理由！”我觉得其中一件事.。当你说你对人们整合你有问题时，这并不难，只是在他们的优先级列表上还不够高，有几种方法可以解决这个问题。其中一件事是派人到处说，“我们要派一名工程师来帮助你集成。”这并不是说公司无法做到，只是不然的话，你将永远处于他们的后台日志的最底层。这是一条路。另一个是，如果他们的CEO告诉他们去做，或者他们自己决定，“我必须去做，这真的很重要。”这几乎从来没有从一堆不同的信息，是一群好的富人。就像一件事，也许在这种情况下.这是一些版本的用户反馈，如果你没有这个，你会比你的竞争对手更慢的迭代。

Andrew: Or that your users will feel like you're more engaged with them, if listening to  the features they want they'll ...

安德鲁：或者你的用户会觉得你更喜欢他们，如果听他们想要的功能，他们会.

Sam: I have two big questions. One, I think back-of-the-envelope math is really important, and I  worry that this is the kind of business where, if you're mostly selling to startups,  and you're selling at, let's say on average, 100 bucks ... Is it a month  or a year?
Andrew: A month.

山姆：我有两个大问题。第一，我认为回过信封的数学是很重要的，我担心这是一种生意，如果你主要是卖给初创公司，而你的平均售价是100美元.是一个月还是一年？安德鲁：一个月。

Sam: A month. How big can this business actually get off of this model? Have you  thought about that?
Andrew: We have thought about it. I think just doing napkin math, I think with a  startup you usually want to arrive somewhere around 100 million annual revenue. For us, right  now it's looking like we'd be going for 10,000 people paying us $100 a month.

山姆：一个月。这个企业到底能摆脱这种模式的规模有多大？你想过吗？安德鲁：我们考虑过了。我想仅仅是做餐巾纸的数学计算，我认为作为一家初创公司，你通常希望达到1亿左右的年收入。对我们来说，现在看来我们需要1万人一个月付我们100美元。

Sam: Does that feel doable?
Andrew: Maybe it's 100,000. Yeah.

山姆：这感觉可行吗？安德鲁：也许是十万。嗯

Yuri: There's the difference there.

尤里：这是有区别的。

Andrew: I think the number ...

安德鲁：我想这个号码.。

Sam: I think it is 100,000 for 100 million.

山姆：我想1亿英镑是10万英镑。

Andrew: Yeah, 100,000, sorry. I think the number of companies that need feedback, and the number  of websites and mobile aps, is increasing, and ...

安德鲁：对，10万，对不起。我认为需要反馈的公司数量、网站和移动APS的数量都在增加，而且.

Yuri: Do you feel there's 100,000 ... Part of it is, do you feel you're going  to have to own like 50 percent of the startup market to get there, or  do you feel there's enough demand out there that you can actually get to the  market without dominating the entire thing?
Andrew: Right.

尤里：你觉得有10万.部分原因是，你觉得你必须拥有50%的创业市场才能达到目标，还是你觉得有足够的需求才能真正进入市场，而不去主宰整个市场呢？安德鲁：对。

Sarah: Right. As an aside to this, I think we've been getting a lot of feedback  that we can actually charge a lot more, and so I think there's a few  features that we can build out that will help a lot, including analytics.

莎拉：对。除此之外，我认为我们已经得到了很多反馈，我们实际上可以收取更多的费用，所以我认为我们可以构建一些功能来帮助我们，包括分析。

Yuri: Do you use your own product?
Sarah: Yeah, definitely. That's a good way to figure out if it's providing value.

尤里：你用自己的产品吗？莎拉：是的，当然。这是一个很好的方法，以确定它是否提供了价值。

Sam: Again, maybe the answer is to charge a lot more, maybe the answer is that  there are 100,000 startups, maybe the answer is you need to tweak the product in  a way that, you can appeal to a lot of people outside of startups, but  I think startups almost never just do the swag on this early enough, and it  really informs product strategy.

山姆：也许答案是收取更多的费用，也许答案是有100，000家初创公司，也许答案是你需要以一种方式来调整产品，你可以吸引很多创业公司以外的人，但我认为初创公司几乎从来没有这么早就这么做过，它确实为产品战略提供了信息。

Sarah: Right.

莎拉：对。

Sam: Which also informs my next big question. This feels like the kind of service that  is interchangeable, and that a lot of people can build a similar service, and if  one company uses product A and another company uses product B, there's no reason for  a third company to prefer A or B. There's no network effect, there's no monopoly.  I can imagine ways that you could build one of those into the product, where  there are sort of cross-company incentives to use yours, but what is your plan to  be a monopoly and not another SAS business that just gets competed down to zero  margins?
Sarah: That's a good question.

山姆：这也告诉了我下一个大问题。这就像是一种可以互换的服务，很多人可以建立类似的服务，如果一家公司使用A产品，另一家公司使用B产品，那么第三家公司就没有理由选择A或B。没有网络效应，也没有垄断。我可以想象，你可以在产品中加入其中一种，在这种情况下，你会有某种跨公司的动机去使用你的产品，但你的计划是成为一家垄断企业，而不是另一家刚刚被竞争到零利润的SAS业务？莎拉：这是个好问题。

Sam: If you don't have an answer yet, it's also fine to just say, "We don't  know yet."
Sarah: Yeah. Our strategy so far is to go after influencers. These are including people who  have users that would also use our product. For example we go after open-source projects  and tools like Optimizely for example.

山姆：如果你还没有答案，也可以说，“我们还不知道。”莎拉：是啊。到目前为止，我们的策略是追捕有影响力的人。这些人包括那些拥有用户的人，他们也会使用我们的产品。例如，我们追求开源项目和工具，比如Optimizely。

Yuri: You give it free to open-source projects?
Sarah: Open-source projects are free, yeah. As an alternative to GitHub and GitHub issues, and they're  bringing in a lot of people, I think that's a good move for us. So  far I think our strategy is really to put our product in front of the  public, it's powered by Canny, and that's kind of where we're at with it.

尤里：你给它免费的开源项目？莎拉：开源项目是免费的。作为GitHub和GitHub问题的替代方案，他们带来了很多人，我认为这对我们来说是个不错的选择。到目前为止，我认为我们的策略是把我们的产品摆在公众面前，它是由Canny提供动力的，这也是我们目前所处的位置。

Sam: do you have any thoughts about this?
Andrew: One little thought. I think one thing that we've found so far is that there  are other products on the market that do this, and during our Product Hunt launch  we got people coming from those products wanting to use us, and the thing that  they mentioned liking about us more is design and simplicity. I honestly feel like our  product, out of all the products in the market right now, is the best designed  and the simplicity for exactly what we do.

山姆：你对此有什么想法吗？安德鲁：一个小小的想法。我认为到目前为止我们发现的一件事是，市场上还有其他产品可以做到这一点，在我们的产品Hunt发布过程中，我们从那些产品中得到了想要使用我们的人，而他们提到的更喜欢我们的是设计和简单。老实说，我觉得我们的产品，在目前市场上的所有产品中，是我们所做的最好的设计，也是最简单的。

Sam: I believe you that that's true, but here's the problem. Every startup, I'd say one  out of three startups I meet with says, "We're like this other thing, except we're  better designed, we're more beautiful, and we're simpler to use." It may be true that  you are, I believe that it is, but someone else can come do that some  thing to you.

山姆：我相信这是真的，但问题是。每一家初创公司，我都会说，我遇到的每三个创业公司中就有一个说：“我们就像另一件事，只不过我们设计得更好，我们更漂亮，而且使用起来也更简单。”也许你是真的，我相信是的，但是其他人可以对你做一些事情。

Yuri: More importantly, or not necessarily more importantly, but often times you start off very simple,  and then you start having to build features because you see that they're missing, and  then somebody else comes in and says, "We're now the simplest."
Sam: In any case, it's really good. You've built a product that people love, you've got  them to pay for it, and you have a growth channel you believe will work.  That puts you in the top few percent of all startups, so that's great. But  this is the time where your biggest problem now, part of that, the one thing  you should be thinking about, is what can I do early to build a product  that, A, can eventually address a very large market, and B, how can I build  some sort of monopoly? How can I build something where, because this company uses my  product, this other company is going to be more likely to use it as well?  Design and simplicity, though everyone says it, and it's kind of true, is usually not  a long-term win. At some point, and it may just be that once your integrated  into a company you're impossible to rip out, and then you're going to win the  mine share war. That could be it.

尤里：更重要的是，或者说不一定更重要，但通常情况下，你一开始非常简单，然后你就开始构建特性，因为你看到它们不见了，然后有人进来说，“我们现在最简单了。”山姆：无论如何，这真的很好。你已经建立了一个人们喜欢的产品，你让他们为此付出代价，而且你有一个你相信会奏效的增长渠道。这使你进入了所有初创公司中的前几个百分点，所以这很好。但现在是你最大的问题，也是其中的一部分，你应该思考的一件事是，我能做些什么来建立一个产品，A，最终可以解决一个非常大的市场，而B，我怎样才能建立某种垄断？我怎样才能建立这样的东西，因为这家公司使用我的产品，而另一家公司也会更有可能使用我的产品？设计和简单，虽然每个人都这么说，这是一种真实的，通常不是一个长期的胜利。在某种程度上，它可能只是，一旦你的合并成为一个公司，你是不可能撕毁，然后你将赢得矿业权战争。可能就是这样。

Sarah: I think that's what we're seeing actually.

莎拉：我想这就是我们实际上看到的。

Sam: A better answer, though, would be if there's some way that you can use aggregated  data or learnings across all companies, or aggregate users ... The kind of users that  leave feedback on products tend to do it across all the products they use, so  there's probably a very small percentage of users that give feedback, and they do it  across all the products. My sense is that somewhere in there, there is a strategy  to build a monopoly, but you want to figure out what that core is and  build that into the core of the product, so that you have a long-term defensible  strategy.

山姆：不过，一个更好的答案是，如果你有办法可以在所有公司或聚合用户中使用聚合数据或学习.那些在产品上留下反馈信息的用户倾向于在他们使用的所有产品上进行反馈，所以很可能有一小部分用户会给出反馈，并且他们会在所有的产品中进行反馈。我的感觉是，在某个地方，有一种建立垄断的策略，但是你想要弄清楚核心是什么，并把它构建到产品的核心，这样你就有了一个长期的防御战略。

Sarah: Yeah. This is actually very interesting, because we probably started at more of an aggregate  level where everyone could feedback about anything. That was hard because companies weren't onboard first
Sam: Yeah, that doesn't feel right either.

莎拉：是啊。这其实是非常有趣的，因为我们可能从一个更多的总体水平开始，每个人都可以对任何事情进行反馈。这很难，因为公司并不是第一位的，山姆：是的，这感觉也不太好。

Sarah: Yeah. Right now we've decided to go this other way for now, but there is  a possibility that one day, we're connecting all the users, if they post on multiple  products that use Canny we can connect all those people, so maybe there's some potential  there eventually, yeah.

莎拉：是啊。现在我们决定走另一条路，但是有一天，我们有可能连接所有的用户，如果他们在使用Canny的多个产品上发布文章，我们可以连接所有这些人，所以也许最终会有一些潜力，是的。

Sam: Why is it named Canny?
Sarah: Canny was really hard to find. We went through many different names, but a core  part of our product is the subdomain, and we didn't want to use something that  was "Get This," or "Try This," "Use this".

山姆：为什么叫Canny？莎拉：精明真的很难找到。我们经历了许多不同的名称，但我们的产品的核心部分是子域，我们不想使用“获取这个”或“尝试这个”，“使用这个”。

Andrew: Short and sweet.

安德鲁：又短又甜。

Sarah: Yeah, so something short and sweet. We got Canny.io, so it's not the worst, but  it's not the best.

莎拉：是啊，那就来点又短又甜的吧。我们有坎尼。奥，所以这不是最坏的，但不是最好的。

Sam: You can still change it's not too late.

山姆：你还是可以改变的-现在还不算太晚。

Sarah: Yes. We can still change.

莎拉：是的。我们还是可以改变的。

Yuri: It thought it was a play on uncanny.

尤里：它认为这是一部关于“不可思议”的戏剧。

Sarah: Yeah. Actually they're kind of different. It means to make good judgment, so I think  that kind of plays in at well.

莎拉：是啊。其实他们有点不同。这意味着要做出正确的判断，所以我认为这种方式发挥得很好。

Yuri: If it's working, if people remember it, if they spell it right, that's all good.

尤里：如果它起作用了，如果人们记得它，如果他们拼写正确的话，那就太好了。

Sarah: Yeah.

莎拉：是啊。

Yuri: Anything else you'd like to talk about?
Sarah: Yeah. In general I think, to your point about broad use cases, after our Product  Hunt launch, it came out with a lot of people using Canny for different reasons,  and so I think focusing on-
Sam: Is there one reason that's surfacing?
Sarah: Yeah. The top one is feature requests, which is what we requested. Also I think  pricing is one of the big ones, figuring out what our main value is, and  that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to isolate that one thing, to especially  market it on our home page. How do we pull people with that one value.

尤里：你还有什么想谈的吗？莎拉：是啊。总的来说，我认为，对于你所说的广泛的用例，在我们的产品Hunt发布之后，有很多人出于不同的原因使用Canny，所以我认为关注于-Sam：有一个原因出现了吗？莎拉：是啊。最前面的是特性请求，这就是我们所要求的。此外，我认为定价是一个大的问题，找出我们的主要价值是什么，这就是我们要做的。我们试图隔离这件事，特别是在我们的主页上推销它。我们怎么才能吸引有这个价值的人。

Sam: Feature requests don't sound quite as good as user ... I don't know. I would  be willing to ... This is the place where I believe in AB testing. I  don't believe in it for everything, but in terms of messaging and communication, and what  are those four words you put big on your website when people come there for  the first time, this is the place I believe in, AB testing. If feature requests  are really what people want, then great.

山姆：功能请求听起来不如用户好.我不知道我愿意.。这是我相信AB测试的地方。我不相信所有的事情，但是在信息和交流方面，当人们第一次来的时候，你在你的网站上放了四个大词是什么，这是我相信的，AB测试的地方。如果功能请求真的是人们想要的，那么很好。

Sarah: Yeah, just put it right up front.

莎拉：是的，把它放在前面就行了。

Sam: If that's the thing that's working, that's at least a candidate for the right answer.

山姆：如果这是起作用的东西，那至少是一个正确答案的候选人。

Sarah: Right.

莎拉：对。

Sam: All right, we should move on to the next group. Thank you so much.

山姆：好吧，我们应该转到下一组去。非常感谢

Sarah: Okay. Thank you.

莎拉：好的。谢谢。

Andrew: Thanks.

安德鲁：谢谢。

Sam: Thank you. Thank you.

山姆：谢谢。谢谢。

Sarah: Thank you.

莎拉：谢谢。

Sam: Thank you. Hey, I'm Sam.

山姆：谢谢。嘿，我是山姆。

Chris: Chris.

克里斯：克里斯。

Yuri: Hey, Yuri.

尤里：嘿，尤里。

Chris: Hey. Chris.

克里斯：嘿。克里斯。

Yuri: How's it going.

尤里：怎么样？

Sam: By the way, I don't know what any of these companies do ahead of time.  Live reaction from me. You want to introduce yourself?
Chris: Hi everybody, my name is Chris Beltran, I'm the CEO and founder of Tuml. What  we do is, we connect home owners, private property owners, and all sorts of parking  lot owners, to our app. Which our app does is, it aggregates, essentially, their parking  spaces, lets them lease it out. The owners are able to make some passive income,  and the parkers are able to just go to their parking spot whenever they want  to easily and quickly. This tool was meant for specifically San Francisco, highly industrialized cities,  in which people need to park easier and faster rather than circling the block.

山姆：顺便说一下，我不知道这些公司提前做了什么。我的实时反应。你想自我介绍吗？克里斯：大家好，我是克里斯·贝尔特兰，我是Tuml的首席执行官和创始人。我们要做的是，我们把房主，私人业主，以及各种各样的停车场所有者连接到我们的应用程序上。我们的应用程序所做的是，它聚集了，基本上，他们的停车位，让他们出租它。业主可以获得一些被动的收入，而停车的人只要想轻松和迅速地就能去他们的停车位。这个工具是专门为旧金山，高度工业化的城市，在那里人们需要更容易和更快的停车，而不是围绕街区。

Yuri: It's like Airbnb parking.

尤里：就像Airbnb的停车场。

Chris: Essentially yes, it is.

克里斯：基本上是这样的。

Yuri: Yeah, I've wanted to see something like this happen for a long time, because it  feels like, in urban cities like San Francisco, there's just not enough street parking.

尤里：是的，我很久以来就想看到这样的事情发生，因为在像旧金山这样的城市里，路边的停车位太少了。

Chris: That is, but right now more of the issue is, is this a perceptive problem,  or is this an actual problem?
Yuri: Are you live in the city right now?
Chris: We are not live in the city. We are currently building out the NVP right  now.

克里斯：是的，但现在更多的问题是，这是一个明显的问题，还是一个实际的问题？尤里：你现在住在城里吗？克里斯：我们不是住在城里的。我们目前正在建立NVP。

Yuri: Got it.

尤里：明白了。

Chris: Unfortunately my cofounder's not here, she's actually taking a vacation through Mexico. I think she's  doing some traveling. Mind you guys, I'm not a solo founder, I do have a  cofounder.

克里斯：不幸的是，我的联合创始人不在这里，她实际上是在墨西哥度假。我想她在旅行。各位，我不是一个单独的创始人，我有一个共同的创始人。

Yuri: That's all right. Have you been talking to home owners in the meantime? Are they  willing to rent out their parking spots?
Chris: You know what, the funny thing is, I am actually hitting the ground running, and  I'm physically going out to these homes and/or private parking lots, and pitching to them  my idea and saying, "Hey, why don't you use our platform, this is what it's  going to look like, and I'm representing our mockups to essentially say, "This is the  platform that you would essentially be using."
Yuri: What do they tell you?
Chris: More often than not they say, "This is awesome. Why haven't anybody else created this?"
Yuri: Are they willing to say, "I'm ready to pay ..." Or, would they pay you?  No, you would pay them to ... You would to a rough share with them,  right?
Chris: Correct. Essentially, the percentage of sales that occur when the commuter parks in their parking  space will collect 15 percent, they collect 85 percent.

尤里：没关系。你和业主谈过了吗？他们愿意把停车位租出去吗？克里斯：你知道吗，有趣的是，我实际上是在跑步，我身体上跑到这些房子和/或私人停车场，向他们介绍我的想法，然后说，“嘿，你为什么不使用我们的平台，这就是它的样子，我代表我们的模特儿说，”这是你本质上要使用的平台。“尤里：他们怎么跟你说的？克丽丝：他们经常说，“这太棒了。为什么没有其他人创造这个？“尤里：他们愿意说，”我准备好了.“或者，他们会付钱给你吗？不，你会付钱给.你会和他们一起分享的，对吗？克里斯：没错。基本上，当通勤者在他们的停车位上停车时，他们会收取15%的销售额，他们会得到85%的收入。”

Yuri: Can you sign them up ... Part of the thing for you is that when  you launch in a city you're going to want as much critical match as for  a parking spot.

尤里：你能帮我签个名吗.对你来说，部分原因是当你在一个城市里发射的时候，你会想要和一个停车位一样多的关键匹配。

Chris: Correct, yeah.

克里斯：对，是的。

Yuri: Are they willing to sign up and say, "My parking spot is yours the moment  you're ready"?
Chris: Currently what we're doing is, we're creating lists and we're pitching the idea to them,  so essentially what we're trying to do is, we're trying to curate all these home  owners and private property owners throughout San Francisco that apply to, pretty much that play  with San Francisco standards, because you cannot park or moped over onto the sidewalk. Obviously  there's some things that we have to double check to make sure that they're completely  legal.

尤里：他们愿意报名说，“我的停车位在你准备好的时候就归你了”吗？克丽丝：目前我们正在做的是，我们正在创建清单，我们正在向他们宣传这个想法，所以我们想要做的基本上是，我们试图在旧金山各地对所有这些房主和私人业主进行管理，这些都是符合旧金山标准的，因为你不能把车停在人行道上，或者骑着脚踏车走到人行道上。显然，有些事情我们必须反复检查，以确保它们是完全合法的。

Yuri: Sure.

尤里：当然。

Chris: Otherwise what we're doing is, we're collecting data from them. Yes, they are more than  willing to sign up with us.

克里斯：否则我们要做的就是从他们那里收集数据。是的，他们非常愿意和我们签约。

Yuri: When do you think you'll launch?
Chris: I pretty much projected to launch within six months, and-
Yuri: Why so long?
Sam: Yeah.

尤里：你想什么时候发射？克里斯：我基本上预计在六个月内启动，-尤里：为什么要这么长时间？山姆：是啊。

Chris: Why so long.

克里斯：为什么这么久？

Yuri: What about six days?
Chris: I would love to build this out in six days, but currently I'm not a  technical founder, or a technical person.

尤里：六天怎么样？克里斯：我很想在六天内完成这个项目，但目前我不是一个技术创办人，也不是一个技术人员。

Yuri: Is your cofounder?
Chris: My cofounder is technical. She has the tools and resources and clout to build this,  essentially, but she's on vacation. Wish she was here.

尤里：你是联合创始人吗？克里斯：我的联合创始人是技术人员。实际上，她有工具、资源和影响力来构建这个平台，但她正在度假。真希望她在这里。

Yuri: When is she back?
Chris: She should be back within the week.

尤里：她什么时候回来？克里斯：她应该在一周内回来。

Yuri: Six days after that.

尤里：六天后。

Chris: I know. I would love to push this.

克里斯：我知道。我很想推动这个。

Sam: One of the things that's really hard is, you're putting this product of yourself out  there when you launch a startup, and no one wants to do it until they  feel like it's really good. In six months the world will look entirely different, and  every good idea you have, someone else has. Now a lot of people are going  to hear about this, because we're talking about this.

山姆：其中一件很难的事情是，当你启动一家初创公司的时候，你会把你自己的产品放在那里，在他们觉得自己的产品真的很好之前，没有人愿意这样做。再过六个月，世界就会完全不同，你的每一个好主意，都是别人的。现在很多人都会听到这个，因为我们在谈论这个。

Chris: Don't steal my idea.

克丽丝：别偷我的主意。

Sam: Hundreds of thousands of people.

山姆：成千上万的人。

Chris: All of you don't steal it. NDAs for all of you.

克里斯：你们都不会偷的。给你们所有人的NDA。

Sam: Speed and execution really matter. You could tell 10 million people the idea, and probably  all of them would be busy with their own things, but a few of them  will be interested at least, and there's this issue of speed, and how quickly you  can build and iterate. Especially in a marketplace, there is a big first mover advantage.  Even if it's not the version you want, my most important piece of advice to  you would be to get this launched really quickly in an ugly first version, and  then you'll learn so much about how to build a better version that you can  go from there. It's great that you're talking to customers, that is clearly the number  one thing to go do, and getting people signed up so that you have inventory,  but I would think about how you bring the launch in, even if it's a  soft launch that you're embarassed about, by a lot.

速度和执行力真的很重要。你可以告诉1000万人这个想法，他们可能都在忙着自己的事情，但至少有几个人会感兴趣，这就是速度的问题，以及你能以多快的速度构建和迭代。特别是在一个市场，有一个大的先行者优势。即使这不是你想要的版本，我给你的最重要的建议是在一个丑陋的第一个版本中尽快推出这个版本，然后你会学到很多关于如何构建一个更好的版本的知识，这样你就可以从这个版本中学到更好的东西了。很高兴你能和客户交谈，这显然是你要做的第一件事，让人们注册，这样你就有了库存，但我会考虑你是如何把发布带来的，即使这是一次你感到尴尬的软启动。

Yuri: Yeah, especially if the problem is acute enough. If it's something that people really struggle  with, finding parking spots, they won't care how pretty the app is, or how ugly  the app is, as long as they can find a parking spot. Having something live,  even if it's just a website wrapped in a little icon ...

尤里：是的，特别是如果问题够严重的话。如果这是人们真正纠结的事情，找到停车位，只要他们能找到一个停车位，他们就不会在乎这款应用有多漂亮，也不在乎它有多丑。即使它只是一个被小图标包裹的网站.

Sam: In one neighborhood.

山姆：在一个街区。

Yuri: Yeah.

尤里：是的。

Chris: That's literally what we're doing, is we're targeting certain neighborhoods. There's neighborhoods, I'm sure you've  been to San Francisco multiple times.

克丽丝：这就是我们真正要做的，我们是针对特定的社区。你肯定去过旧金山好几次了。

Yuri: I live there.

尤里：我住在那里。

Chris: You live there, obviously. Haight district is one of them, which is severely impacted, nine  times out of 10, even during the week ...

克里斯：很明显，你住在那里。海特区是其中之一，受到严重影响，10次中有9次，甚至在一周内也是如此.

Sam: How do you know?
Chris: I've been there physically and had a checkboard out, and checking the times, and stand  there for eight hours a day. But there are times when it does free up  a little bit, but for the most par it's-
Sam: I understand how you're going to get the parking places onboard, which is I think  the harder half of the marketplace, but you still need people to want to park.

山姆：你怎么知道的？克里斯：我去过那里，有一个检查板，检查时间，每天在那里站八个小时。但有时它确实有一点自由，但最重要的是-山姆：我理解你将如何把停车位放在船上，我认为这是市场上比较困难的一半，但你仍然需要人们想要停车。

Chris: Correct.

克里斯：对。

Sam: How are you going to get those people?
Chris: What we're going to do is, we're going to reach out to people during festivals.  There's tons of festivals, there's Outside Lands, there's some that go on in Island, even  though that's out of our reach, but there's many that happen around Golden Gate Park,  there's Beta Breakers, there's tons of festivals that we're going to be pitching this around,  or some type of theme, or some type of festival, some type of ball game.

山姆：你要怎么把那些人弄到手？克里斯：我们要做的是，在节日期间向人们伸出援助之手。有很多节日，有外面的土地，有一些在岛上进行，尽管这是我们力所能及的，但是在金门公园有很多发生的事情，有贝塔·布雷克，有无数的节日我们将围绕着这个主题，或者某种类型的节日，某种类型的球类游戏。

Sam: I worry that those, A, don't happen frequently enough, and B, those are people who  are not looking for parking super regularly in the city. It would be interesting if  you could figure out a way to find people for whom this is truly a  hair-on-fire problem that drive to the city every day and have to park, or live  in the city and don't have a parking place. That does not strike me as  the most urgent need, or the best way to find people who are really feeling  this problem every day, which there are a lot. This is a great problem to  be solving. I would think about other strategies to find a lot of people. The  festival thing, I worry there aren't enough festivals and there aren't enough people at those  to have this as a regular ongoing problem. You want the people who are going  to be daily or at least weekly users of this, and I bet you can  come up with better ways.

山姆：我担心那些，A，发生得不够频繁，而B，那些人不是经常在城里找停车位的。如果你能找到一种方法来找到这样的人，那就很有趣了，因为这确实是一个火上浇油的问题，每天开车到城市去，不得不停车，或者住在城市里，没有停车位。我并不认为这是最迫切的需要，也不是找到那些每天真正感受到这个问题的人的最好方法，而这方面有很多。这是一个有待解决的大问题。我会考虑其他的策略来找到很多人。节日的事情，我担心没有足够的节日，也没有足够的人在那些人把这作为一个经常性的持续问题。你想要的人是每天或至少每周的用户，我敢打赌，你可以想出更好的方法。

Yuri: I think if you're feet on the ground and actually surveying the place, I would  actually ask the people who are parking, "Why are you here?"
Chris: That's exactly what I'm doing.

尤里：我想，如果你是站在地上，并且真的在调查这个地方，我会问停车的人，“你为什么在这里？”克里斯：这正是我要做的。

Yuri: So what's the feedback? Are they working there?
Andrew: Nine times out of 10, people are either commuting into the city, so they're people  people that are not living in the city, obviously, because a lot of people who  live in the city don't necessarily own a car, so there's-
Yuri: Right, but they're commuting for what? Are they commuting for work?
Chris: They're commuting for work, and sometimes they're just commuting to do some contract work. They've  got a come to the city every so often, there's people that come in for  meetings, a whole host of reasons that they come in.

尤里：那么反馈是什么呢？他们在那里工作吗？安德鲁：10次中有9次，人们要么上下班，要么不住在城里，很明显，因为很多住在城里的人不一定有车，所以有-尤里：对，但他们是为了什么而通勤呢？他们上班通勤吗？克丽丝：他们是上班上下班，有时只是为了做一些合同工作。他们经常来这座城市，有很多人来开会，他们进来的原因很多。

Sam: These people are driving today and parking today, maybe they'll do it more if it's  easier, but can you put signs in the parking lot, in the parking spaces, that  say, "To park here, download this"?
Chris: Yeah. Essentially just ...

萨姆：这些人今天开车，今天停车，如果比较容易的话，也许他们会做得更多，但是你能在停车场，在停车位上贴上标语吗，上面写着“停在这里，下载这个”？克里斯：是的。基本上就是.。

Sam: That would work.

山姆：那会管用的。

Chris: When that time comes in which we do have a product launch, I'm going to  create maybe little signs at first. Something cheap just to get started, maybe laminated or  whatnot, to put it on those places where it needs to be. It's designated .

克里斯：当我们推出新产品的时候，我首先要创造一些小的迹象。一些便宜的东西只是为了开始，也许是层叠的，或者什么的，把它放在需要的地方。是指定的。

Sam: Right. You need something, because in a lot of cases it is an impulse buy.  They're going to be looking for parking, they didn't find the street parking, and now  they're ready to buy whatever it is that you're giving them.

山姆：对。你需要一些东西，因为在很多情况下，这是一种冲动购买。他们会去找停车位，他们没有找到路边的停车位，现在他们已经准备好买你给他们的任何东西了。

Chris: Yeah.

克里斯：是的。

Sam: I have a general thought for you about this kind of marketplace. Airbnb is a  really good business, because if you own a space and you're renting it out, you  can only put it on basically one platform, if you're going to use the instant  book feature, and if you're a guest, you really care if you get these particular  house or this particular house. They're not interchangeable. Ride sharing, if you're a driver you  can drive for any service, you can turn the apps on and off, and if  you're a passenger you don't really care which car you get in. It's really nice  if you can somehow have the former kind of marketplace, where there's not just perfect  substitution and everyone is switching between each service depending on price. If you can do  something with ... I think this is actually a very big and important insight about  parketplaces that most people miss. If you can do something where people can only list  their space on your marketplace because you're going to have around-the-clock instant booking or something,  that would be really important to figure out early, and a very valuable tweak that  doesn't sound that big, but is actually a huge difference to the long-term viability of  the business.

山姆：我对这种市场有一个大致的想法。Airbnb是一家很好的公司，因为如果你拥有一个空间，你可以把它租出去，你只能把它放在一个平台上，如果你要使用速记功能，如果你是一位客人，你真的很在乎你是否买到了这些房子或者这所房子。它们是不可互换的。共乘，如果你是一名司机，你可以驾驶任何服务，你可以打开或关闭应用程序，如果你是乘客，你并不真正关心你开哪辆车。如果你能以某种方式拥有前一种市场的话，那就太好了，那里不仅有完美的替代，而且每个人都会根据价格在每种服务之间切换。如果你能用.我认为，这实际上是一个非常大和重要的洞察力，对Parketplace，大多数人错过了。如果你能做的事情，人们只能在你的市场上列出他们的空间，因为你将有24小时的即时预订或其他，这将是非常重要的发现，尽早，和一个非常有价值的调整，听起来不太大，但实际上是一个巨大的差异，长期生存的业务。

Chris: I think that's a good take on it. Right now, as far as the 24-hour  booking and whatnot, I want to give the property owners or home owners the ability  to set their own times.

克里斯：我认为这是个不错的选择。现在，关于24小时的预订和诸如此类的事情，我想给业主或业主自己设定时间的能力。

Sam: Sure.

山姆：当然。

Chris: Sometimes maybe some owners or property owners, we'll just say like Wells Fargo, they set  theirs a little bit later after business hours is closed.

克丽丝：有时可能是一些业主或业主，我们只会说，就像富国银行一样，他们会在营业时间结束后稍晚设置他们的。

Yuri: Do you think that you'll be able to get businesses to give up their parking  spaces though?
Chris: I would love to reach out to businesses to give up their parking spaces as  well.

尤里：你认为你能让企业放弃他们的停车位吗？克丽丝：我也想和商家联系，放弃他们的停车位。

Yuri: Interesting. I was thinking that this is more around home owners or people who have  extra spaces on their own, but businesses could be really interesting. It's a very different  sale now, because now you really have to go and convince whoever the property manager  is, or somebody else, to actually do it.

尤里：有意思。我在想，这更多的是围绕房主或那些自己有额外空间的人，但生意可能真的很有趣。这是一个非常不同的出售，因为现在你真的必须去说服谁是房地产经理，或其他人，真正做到这一点。

Chris: Correct.

克里斯：对。

Yuri: Go ahead.

尤里：来吧。

Sam: Sorry, just one thought here, which is I would pick one of them in the  beginning, because you won't be able to sell to both.

山姆：对不起，这里有一个想法，那就是我会在一开始选一个，因为你不能同时卖给他们两个。

Chris: Yeah. I especially wanted to be able to focus on residential and private lots first,  and then start slowly building out.

克里斯：是的。我特别希望能够首先专注于住宅和私人土地，然后慢慢地开始建设。

Sam: Do you have any sense yet for pricing?
Chris: Yes. I pretty much wanted to model this after the meters in San Francisco, and  right now the meters are all timed. Sf Park actually did a survey in which  they increased metr pricing similar to variable based pricing. That's what we're going to pretty  much mimic. Essentially we want to be competing with the meters themselves for residential. For  private lots obviously we're going to be competing with private lot prices, so we're just  going to base our model off of the model that San Francisco has already done.

山姆：你对定价有什么感觉吗？克里斯：是的。我很想模仿旧金山的电表，现在计价器都是计时的。SFPark实际上做了一项调查，其中他们提高了元定价，类似于基于变量的定价。这就是我们将要模仿的。从本质上说，我们想与电表本身竞争住宅。显然，对于私人地产，我们将与私人拍品价格竞争，所以我们将把我们的模型建立在旧金山已经做过的模型的基础上。

Sam: People will be able to park, I assume, as long as they want and the  property owner is .

山姆：我想，只要人们愿意，只要房主愿意，他们就可以停车。

Chris: As long as the property owners set their times to say eight to five, they  can park eight to five and it'll be on a hourly rate.

克里斯：只要房主把时间定在8到5点，他们就可以停车8到5点，按小时收费。

Sam: What's the legal situation of this? I assume it's okay if it's private property.

山姆：这是什么法律状况？我想如果是私人财产也没关系。

Chris: It is legal. It is completely legal. I've looked into it, I've talked to an  SF law attorney specifically for San Francisco themselves, and I've asked them ... It's kind  of a funny question. The story goes, I called them up, I said, "My dad  is bed-ridden, he's not able to work, he doesn't get enough from social security, and  essentially he needs to make some passive income. Is it okay if we could rent  this space out to our neighbor?" They said, "As long as its his house, we  don't see any issue with it."
Yuri: Great. That's great.

克里斯：这是合法的。这是完全合法的。我已经调查过了，我和旧金山的一位SF律师谈过了，我问过他们.这是个有趣的问题。故事是这样的，我打电话给他们，我说，“我爸爸卧床不起，他不能工作，他从社会保障中得不到足够的收入，基本上他需要一些被动的收入。我们可以把这个空间租给我们的邻居吗？”他们说，“只要是他的房子，我们看不出有什么问题。”尤里：太好了。太好了

Sam: Again, this is a really good idea. If you don't move fast it won't work.  I think it's always important as a startup to know what the number one biggest  problem in front of you is. For you, it's not shipping quickly. Just get this  working in one neighborhood as quickly as you possibly can, even if it's hacked up  and doesn't look that great.

山姆：再说一次，这真是个好主意。如果你动作不快，它就不起作用了。我认为，作为一家初创公司，了解你面前最大的问题是什么总是很重要的。对你来说，它的运输速度不快。只要让它尽快在一个社区工作，即使它被黑客攻击，看起来不太好。

Chris: Okay.

克里斯：好的。

Sam: Any other questions you want to discuss?
Chris: I think that's it.

山姆：你还想讨论其他问题吗？克里斯：我想就是这样了。

Sam: Great. I'm excited to try it out.

山姆：太好了。我很兴奋能试一试。

Chris: Awesome, thank you.

克里斯：太棒了，谢谢。

Sam: Thank you.

山姆：谢谢。

Yuri: Thank you.

尤里：谢谢。

Sam: Email us when you launch.

山姆：你发射的时候给我们发电子邮件。

Chris: Awesome, thank you.

克里斯：太棒了，谢谢。

Yuri: How's it going. Yuri.

尤里：怎么样？尤里。

Emma: Philip.

菲利普。

Yuri: Nice to meet you.

尤里：很高兴见到你。

Philip: I'm Emma.

菲利普：我是艾玛。

Yuri: Yuri. Nice to meet you.

尤里：尤里。见到你很高兴

Philip: Nice to meet you.

菲利普：很高兴见到你。

Yuri: What do you guys do?
Emma: I'm Philip.

尤里：你们是做什么的？艾玛：我是菲利普。

Philip: I'm Emma, and we're Moonlight Work. We're building a marketplace for software engineers and designers  to match up with companies who need them, 10 hours at a time.

菲利普：我是艾玛，我们是月光工作。我们正在为软件工程师和设计师建立一个市场，让他们与需要他们的公司相匹配，每次10个小时。

Yuri: Specifically 10 hours at a time?
Philip: Yeah. I think we'll start with 10 hours at a time, but some companies want  more than that, and some people want more work, so if they want more time  they can have more time.

尤里：特别是每次10个小时？菲利普：是啊。我想我们一次从10个小时开始，但有些公司想要更多的工作，有些人想要更多的工作，所以如果他们想要更多的时间，就可以有更多的时间。

Sam: Is this launched, up and running?
Philip: We have a prototype up and running. We haven't had anybody else use it, but  both of us have both ...

山姆：这是启动，启动和运行吗？菲利普：我们有一个正在运行的原型。我们没让其他人用过，但我们俩都有.

Sam: Built projects for other people? That's a great way to start.

山姆：为别人建项目？这是个很好的开始。

Philip: Yes. We started because we have this need ourselves.

菲利普：是的。我们开始是因为我们需要我们自己。

Sam: Where do companies find you?
Emma: There's been a variety of them. Some of them have been friends of friends that  heard that we were doing contract work, and would come ein and assign jobs through  there. Another thing is, when we shut down our last company we open-sourced all of  the code, and so we had people coming in and paying us to deploy that  code for them on their own servers. They found us through Git Hub basically.

山姆：公司在哪里找到你的？艾玛：有很多种。他们中的一些人是朋友的朋友，听说我们在做合同工作，他们会从那里来分配工作。另一件事是，当我们关闭上一家公司的时候，我们把所有的代码都开源了，所以我们让人们进来，付钱给我们，让他们在自己的服务器上部署代码。他们基本上是通过Git Hub找到我们的。

Sam: What kind of projects are people having you build so far?
Philip: So far it's a lot of people who have a very specific need, so they're  like, "I need an expert in this language," or an expert that knows how to  build this thing really well, and so they're looking for someone who, there's not going  to be much onboarding, they're just going to be able to jump in and do  a project.

山姆：到目前为止，人们让你建造什么样的项目？菲利普：到目前为止，很多人都有非常特殊的需求，所以他们会说，“我需要一位精通这门语言的专家”，或者是一位知道如何把这个东西做得很好的专家，所以他们正在寻找这样一个人，他们不会有太多的上船，他们只会跳进去做一个项目。

Yuri: Why do they choose you instead of something like paperwork or TopTel or one of  the other outsourcing houses?
Philip: I think the biggest reason is because we're promoting it as something that experts are  working on, so these aren't just anyone in the world who wants to make $15  dollars an hour. This is someone who maybe works at a Google, or an Uber,  and they want to make a bunch of extra money on the side, but they're  really good at what they do.

尤里：为什么他们选择你，而不是文书工作、Toptel或其他外包公司之一？菲利普：我认为最大的原因是因为我们把它宣传为专家们正在研究的东西，所以世界上任何想要每小时赚15美元的人都不是这样的。这是一个可能在谷歌或者优步工作的人，他们想赚点额外的钱，但是他们真的很擅长他们的工作。

Yuri: So you're gone have to actually curate these people.

尤里：所以你已经走了，必须真正地管教这些人。

Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah.

菲利普：嗯-嗯(是的)，是的。

Yuri: Is that something you're already doing?
Philip: Yeah. That's what we're starting to do, and I think that's going to be the  biggest barrier for us, is being able to make sure that these people are really  quality workers.

尤里：那是你已经在做的事了吗？菲利普：是啊。这就是我们开始做的，我认为这将是我们最大的障碍，就是能够确保这些人是真正的高素质的工人。

Sam: How much are you charging for a 10-hour project?
Emma: The contractors set their own rates, and then we're handling the invoicing and charging 15  percent on top of that.

山姆：10小时的项目你要多少钱？艾玛：承包商自己定了费率，然后我们处理发票和收费15%以上的问题。

Sam: But true marketplace.

山姆：但真正的市场。

Emma: Correct, yeah.

对，没错。

Sam: Other than quality, given that so many people ... This is clearly a good business,  so a lot of people want in, a lot of people are already in it.  How will you become the marketplace where everyone goes for contracted engineering help?
Emma: I think we can speak from our own experience and say there have been times  in the past where we had student loans, and would've worked extra time every week  to pay them off, and there's not really parketplaces out there where people who want  over 50 or $70 per hour can find short term projects that they can do  on the side.

除了质量，考虑到这么多人.。这显然是一项很好的生意，所以很多人都想加入，很多人已经在其中了。你将如何成为每个人都去寻求工程合同帮助的市场？艾玛：我想我们可以从我们自己的经验中说，过去我们有很多次获得助学贷款，而且每周都会有额外的时间来偿还这些贷款，而且没有真正的地方，在那里，每小时想要超过50或70美元的人可以找到他们可以做的短期项目。

Yuri: That's true on the developer side, but how do you get the companies to come  to you and say, "When we need an expert we go to you guys"?
Emma: We're working on a couple different ways of matching, but I think the short of  it is that there are very specialized needs that some companies have, and it doesn't  even have to be core to the product. Sometimes it's like, "I need to set  up a development environment," or, "I want a landing page and our design team is  focused on an app," or something like that.

尤里：对开发者来说是这样的，但是你怎么让公司来找你说，“当我们需要一个专家的时候，我们就去找你们”？艾玛：我们正在研究几种不同的匹配方法，但我认为不足的是，有些公司有非常特殊的需求，甚至不需要成为产品的核心。有时就像，“我需要建立一个开发环境”，或者“我想要一个登陆页面，我们的设计团队专注于一个应用程序，”或者类似的东西。

Yuri: I wonder if you want to become known as the place to go to for  a particular set of skills. Not for every expertise, but in the beginning it's just  like a particular set, where they just go to you and then you open up  additional verticals as you go.

尤里：我想知道你是否想成为一个拥有特定技能的地方。并不是所有的专业技术，但在一开始，它就像一个特定的集合，在那里他们只是去你，然后你打开额外的垂直当你走。

Emma: For that we're looking at open-source projects. An open-source project is something where it takes  a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience, to understand the ins and the outs.  We tested that with our own open source projects, and got projects coming through there  and people signing up, and I think that matching people based on very specific open  source projects. Not saying Ruby programming language, but something like, the Mongo DB bindings for  Chef, or something very specific for that.

艾玛：为此，我们正在研究开源项目。开源项目需要大量的知识和经验，才能理解内部和外部情况。我们用我们自己的开源项目对此进行了测试，并获得了项目的通过和人们的注册，我认为匹配人员的基础是非常具体的开源项目。不是说Ruby编程语言，而是类似为Chef编写的MongoDB绑定，或者是一些非常具体的绑定。

Sam: I think the insight of going after high-end work, and also for people who are  just looking for smaller pieces, is really good. I wonder if you could pick projects  that particularly need that, like projects that are harder to build and take less time,  sort of need specialized skills and are not the normal, "I just need people to  grind through this". That would strike me as a good initial focus.

山姆：我认为追求高端作品的洞察力，以及那些只是在寻找较小作品的人，都是非常好的。我想知道你是否能选择那些特别需要的项目，比如那些更难建立，花费更少时间的项目，需要一些专门的技能，而不是正常的，“我只是需要人们来磨练这个”。这会让我觉得这是一个很好的初始关注点。

Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

菲利普：嗯-嗯(是的)。

Sam: What's the biggest problem in front of the company right now?
Philip: I think it's making sure that matching ... Obviously every marketplace has that issue, but  making sure that the people we have are worth what they're trying to get charged  for. Because we want to set a limit on how much people can charge for  hour so we will have higher-
Sam: Why?
Philip: We want people that are ... Minimum, sorry.

山姆：现在公司面临的最大问题是什么？菲利普：我认为这是为了确保.显然，每个市场都有这样的问题，但要确保我们拥有的人值得他们为之收费。因为我们想限制人们每小时收费多少，这样我们就有了更高的收费-山姆：为什么？菲利普：我们想要的人.最低限度抱歉。

Sam: Oh.

山姆：哦。

Philip: We want people who are making more money per hour, because that's going to bump  up the quality of the work .

菲利普：我们想要的是每小时赚更多钱的人，因为这会提高工作的质量。

Sam: How much do you charge for hour?
Philip: We're both trying to charge about 150 an hour. We've had about 300 people sign  up so far, and we asked them what their hourly rate is, and it's usually  from about 70 to 200 per hour.

山姆：你每小时收费多少？菲利普：我们都在试着每小时收费150英镑左右。到目前为止，我们已经有大约300人注册了，我们问他们每小时的工资是多少，通常是每小时70到200人。

Yuri: The interesting thing is that it's not so much how much the people are charging,  it's more the perceived value on the other companies. If the company is saying that  these developers are worth the 150 or $200 an hour, they don't actually ... They're  happy to pay that, but you need to convince them that they're worth that money,  regardless of what the developers think they're worth.

尤里：有趣的是，问题不在于人们收取了多少钱，而在于其他公司的价值。如果公司说这些开发商价值每小时150或200美元，他们实际上并不是.他们很乐意为此付出代价，但你需要让他们相信，他们是值得的，不管开发人员认为他们值多少钱。

Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

菲利普：嗯-嗯(是的)。

Yuri: How do you do that? How do you convince a company that your developers are  worth $200 an hour if they can go somewhere for $25 an hour?
Philip: Yeah, and I think right now for the NVP, what we're trying to say is,  we are personally experts in these field, and we're making sure that the quality of  talent we have is up to that par. I think that we need to figure  out how we're going to scale that.

尤里：你是怎么做到的？如果开发人员能以每小时25美元的价格去某个地方，你如何说服一家公司，让他们相信你的开发人员每小时价值200美元？菲利普：是的，我认为现在对NVP来说，我们想说的是，我们是这些领域的专家，我们正在确保我们拥有的人才质量达到这个水平。我认为我们需要弄清楚我们要如何扩大规模。

Sam: I also think, in addition to figuring out how to scale it, you need to  figure out how you're going to communicate it. The website really has to give across  the impression with testimonials from well-known customers for whatever, that these are the best people.  In terms of studying the prices, one thing that we have consitently seen is, when  you ask a user to set their price in the marketplace, if you give them  guidance, if you say, "Based on what you said, here's what we recommend," or, "Here's  the range we recommend," 85, 90 percent of the users will do that. If you  want to move people towards a specific range because you want people that are that  quality level, you can probably do that.

山姆：我也认为，除了弄清楚如何扩大它，你还需要弄清楚你要如何沟通它。该网站确实必须给大家留下这样的印象：无论是谁，这些都是最优秀的人，这是来自知名客户的推荐信。在研究价格方面，我们已经看到的一件事是，当你要求用户在市场上设定他们的价格时，如果你给他们指点，如果你说，“基于你说的，这是我们的建议”，或者，“这是我们推荐的范围，”85%，90%的用户会这么做。如果你想把人们推向一个特定的范围，因为你想要的人是那样的质量水平，你可能可以这样做。

Emma: we did that. Our signup form says the average hourly rate is $70 per hour,  and it also says if you have you annual salary, that's about what your hourly  rate is. $100,000 per year is about $50 per hour.

艾玛：我们做到了。我们的注册表格上说平均小时工资是每小时70美元，而且还说如果你有年薪，那就是你的小时工资。每年100，000美元约为每小时50美元。

Yuri: When do you think you'll have the first external developer live, that's not the two  of you?
Emma: We're working on basically building out invoicing right now, and so that'll be the next  week or two, probably.

尤里：你认为你什么时候会有第一个外部开发人员现场直播，那不是你们两个？艾玛：我们现在基本上正在建立发票，所以可能是在接下来的一两个星期。

Yuri: Can you do it more manually in the beginning? Just so that you can see  someone who's not you ... Because you obviously don't have invoicing.

尤里：一开始你能用手多做些吗？这样你就能看到一个不是你的人.。因为你显然没有发票。

Philip: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

菲利普：嗯-嗯(是的)。

Emma: We've been doing this ourselves, and there's just a lot of moving parts. There's sending  contracts back and forth, there's setting up bank accounts, there's getting companies to pay. When  we talk to the potential contractors who want to be on the platform, some of  their biggest concerns are, if I'm only working 10 hours per week, how much time  does it take to ramp up? Do I need to talk with the customer, and  how long does it take until I get paid?
Yuri: I would try and hack all of that way and just do it behind the  scenes manually right now, just to get the developers developing. Take all of the pressure  away from them so that they can just start interacting with a customer, and if  you need to manually process it do that. It's so important that someone who's not  you starts doing this on your perform.

艾玛：这是我们自己做的，只是有很多移动部件。有合同来回发送，有设立银行账户，有公司付款。当我们与想要在平台上工作的潜在承包商交谈时，他们最关心的问题是，如果我每周只工作10个小时，那需要多长时间才能增加呢？我需要和顾客谈谈吗？我需要多长时间才能拿到工资？尤里：我会尝试破解所有这些方法，现在就在幕后手动进行，只是为了让开发人员进行开发。把所有的压力从他们身上移开，这样他们就可以开始和客户交互，如果你需要手动处理的话，就可以这样做。重要的是，一个不是你的人开始在你的表演中做这件事。

Emma: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

艾玛：嗯-嗯(是的)。

Sam: Then when they do, for the first ones especially, I would be super involved, just  to learn what the issues are. It may be that people aren't sure they're allowed  to do this, and they need help looking at their current employment contracts. It may  be that people need training to know how to engage with a customer, and how  much they should communicate. There are all of these things, many of which will surprise  you, and your guesses on many will be wrong, and the way you find this  out is to just, for the first, let's say, 20 users, go sit with them.  Or at least go talk to them all the time.

山姆：那么，当他们这么做的时候，尤其是第一批，我会非常积极地参与进来，仅仅是为了了解问题的症结所在。这可能是因为人们不确定他们是否被允许这么做，他们需要帮助查看他们目前的雇佣合同。也许人们需要培训才能知道如何与客户打交道，以及他们应该进行多少沟通。所有这些都会让你大吃一惊，你对很多人的猜测都是错误的，而你发现这个问题的方法就是，首先，比如说，20个用户，和他们坐在一起。或者至少去找他们谈谈。

Yuri: I would at least think about it like, become their agent. If they were a  talent, and you were an agent for them, and you take care of everything for  them and answer all their questions.

尤里：我至少会想一想，做他们的经纪人。如果他们是天才，而你是他们的经纪人，你为他们照顾好一切，回答他们的所有问题。

Sam: Then you can just start building that into the product. In our experience, almost every  time when the people think they know where the break points are going to be,  or what they need to teach their users, they're almost always wrong. But you find  it out really quickly. You don't need a giant sample set to start hearing the  common concerns people have at every stage in the process, and then you just knock  those off one at a time. That is a way I think you can differentiate  from other coding talent parketplaces that don't do this. If you can figure out, if  you can be the person that makes it so that people who want a little  extra income but don't know how to go be a financer learn, and if that  becomes your reputation, that'll be a great way to get the top talent in the  field.

山姆：那你就可以开始把它植入产品中了。根据我们的经验，几乎每一次当人们认为他们知道断点会在哪里，或者他们需要教他们的用户什么时候，他们几乎总是错的。但你很快就会发现的。你不需要一个巨大的样本来开始听到人们在这个过程中的每一个阶段的共同关注，然后你只需要一次就可以消除这些问题。这是一个方法，我认为你可以区别于其他编码人才的空间，不这样做。如果你能弄清楚，如果你能成为那个人，让那些想要一点额外收入但又不知道如何成为一个资助者的人去学习，如果这成为了你的声誉，那将是获得这一领域顶尖人才的一个很好的方式。

Yuri: One of the other, just an idea, which you may or may not want to  pursue, but if you want to be known as the experts in the field, see  if you can get any experts to actually use your platform through your network or  somewhere else. Or get someone who's well-known on a particular niche area and have them  sign up on your platform and do projects on your platform, if they're willing to.

尤里：另一个，只是一个想法，你可能想要也可能不想去追求，但如果你想成为这个领域的专家，看看你能不能让任何专家通过你的网络或其他地方实际使用你的平台。或者找一个在某个特定领域很有名的人，让他们在你的平台上注册，并在你的平台上做项目，如果他们愿意的话。

Philip: Yeah.

菲利普：是啊。

Sam: What's your biggest problem right now?
Emma: Us personally?
Sam: The company.

山姆：你现在最大的问题是什么？艾玛：我们个人？山姆：公司。

Yuri: In this stage it's often one and the same.

尤里：在这个阶段，经常是一样的。

Emma: Yeah.

艾玛：是啊。

Philip: I think it's more just getting the machinery up. If we were to manually take  payments, my big concern would be that 10 months down the line I'm going to  have to manually calculate 1099s, things like that.

菲利普：我想更多的是把机器修好。如果我们手动支付，我最担心的是，在10个月后，我将不得不手动计算1099秒，诸如此类的事情。

Yuri: But you're not going to be 10 months down the line. You need to get  to the next two months.

尤里：但你不会在这条线上呆上10个月。你得在接下来的两个月里。

Philip: Yeah.

菲利普：是啊。

Emma: I would say to go along with that, the reason we feel like we have  to have some sort of payment thing set up is because there's so many laws  around how you can pay people, and kind of the logistics of all that, and  paperwork that needs to be gone through. I think you're right, we need to do  those first couple ones to know what those are, but I think we're both apprehensive  of doing that.

艾玛：我想说的是，我们认为我们必须建立某种支付方式的原因是，关于如何向人们支付工资的法律太多了，所有这些的后勤工作，以及需要通过的文书工作。我认为你是对的，我们需要做第一批人才能知道这是什么，但我认为我们都担心这样做。

Sam: Is there not just some other startup that you can use that handles invoicing really  well? It is complicated.

山姆：难道就没有其他一些你能很好地处理发票的初创公司了吗？这很复杂。

Yuri: Or just an accountant that can help you?
Emma: Yeah. Do you want to Stripe(inaudible)
Philip: Yeah. We're using Stripe Connect, which handles everything including the 1099s, but there's no turnkey  invoicing system built on top of that right now.

尤里：还是一个能帮你的会计？艾玛：是啊。你想不想(听不见)菲利普：是的。我们使用的是StripeConnect，它处理所有东西，包括1099，但是现在还没有建立在此之上的交钥匙发票系统。

Yuri: Yeah, I get that. I really do get that, but I still feel like it's  so ... I get that feeling as a developer all the time, where it's like,  if only I have this built I'd be ready to go. But it's so much  more important to actually find out if you can ... Even if you have the  platform built, there's the chance that people won't start using it, and you'll only know  that when you do the non-scalable things. That's one of the things that we drive  home almost every single office hour session, which is just, do the non-scalable things. Do  it manually. Don't worry about 10 months down the road. 10 months down the road  it's a new company. It will look very different than it is today. Today it's  so important to just do the non-scalable things.

尤里：是的，我明白。我真的明白，但我还是觉得.作为一名开发人员，我一直都有这种感觉，就像，如果我有这个构建的话，我就会做好准备。但更重要的是找出你能不能.即使您已经构建了平台，人们也有可能不会开始使用它，而且只有在您做不可伸缩的事情时，您才会知道这一点。这是我们开车回家的事情之一，几乎每一个办公时间会议，也就是，做不可伸缩的事情。手工操作。别担心10个月以后。10个月后，这是一家新公司。它将看起来与今天大不相同。今天，做不可伸缩的事情是非常重要的。

Sam: We're just talking about a small handful of users. You don't have to bring on  ... Everyone's like, "My problem is that if I do this non-scalable thing, 2,000 users  will sign up tomorrow ...

山姆：我们只是在谈论一小部分用户。你不必.每个人都说，“我的问题是，如果我做这个不可伸缩的事情，2，000个用户明天就会注册.

Philip: You should be so lucky.

菲利普：你应该这么幸运。

Sam: Then we'll have to deal with them. That is not what's going to happen. It's  a slightly instinct to say that my big problem is that I haven't built this  one piece of the software yet, not that my biggest problem is how I'm going  to get those 2,000 users.

山姆：那我们就得对付他们了。这不是将要发生的事。我有点本能地说，我的大问题是我还没有构建这一款软件，而不是我最大的问题是如何获得这2000名用户。

Philip: What we're focusing on basically is the invoicing right now. It's not people logging in  or anything like that, it's just being able to take your credit card or bank  account details right now.

菲利普：我们现在关注的基本上是发票。这不是人们登录或诸如此类的，它只是能够获取你的信用卡或银行帐户的详细信息。

Sam: Okay, well again, if that's the one thing you want to do, I would get  that to work .

山姆：好吧，如果这是你想做的一件事，我会让它起作用的。

Yuri: if you think you'll have it live in a week ...

尤里：如果你认为你会在一周内活下来.

Sam: My answer to that question about your biggest problem ... I'm not worried about the  fact that you'll be ability to get people that need developers to build something. There's  a lot of people that have an idea for an app. The thing that I  worry about is, every so often we've seen the idea of, "I'm going to get  these great developers to build stuff for other people," and it has been so hard  to actually do that, because the reasons that people have thought they're going to get  the developers, or the assumptions in, developer know how to do this well, have just  been so wrong. You still don't have ... You won't notice your own problems because  you've thought about this a lot. You may find out that invoicing doesn't even need  to built the way you think it needs to be built, because there's something fundamental  about the model that's going to change, but getting people you don't know, or you  don't know well, to build projects on a platform, I think that's a really important  step.

山姆：我对你最大的问题的回答.我并不担心这样一个事实，即你将有能力让需要开发人员来构建一些东西。有很多人有一个应用程序的想法。我担心的是，我们经常看到这样的想法：“我要让这些优秀的开发人员为其他人构建东西”，这是很难做到的，因为人们认为他们会吸引开发人员的原因，或者假设，开发者知道如何做好这件事，都是非常错误的。你还是没有.。你不会注意到你自己的问题，因为你已经想了很多。你可能会发现，发票甚至不需要建立你认为应该建立的方式，因为这个模型有一些基本的东西会改变，但是让你不认识的人，或者你不太了解的人，在一个平台上构建项目，我认为这是一个非常重要的步骤。

Philip: I agree with that. I would just add in that the idea came from a  prior company where we didn't have the time to go hire people, and we started  hiring part-time people, people who were friends of friends, things like that. We started to  do a lot of first-hand research like that.

菲利普：我同意。我想补充的是，这个想法来自于以前的一家公司，当时我们没有时间去雇佣员工，我们开始雇佣兼职员工，那些朋友的朋友，诸如此类的事情。我们开始做很多这样的第一手研究。

Yuri: I think that's great. That's actually super important, because it means you have the pain  and you understand the pain. Sam and I are just kind of driving to the  same thing, which is, it's so critical to get someone who has nothing to do  with your previous business or your current core business, that wants to start using it.

尤里：我觉得这很好。这其实是非常重要的，因为它意味着你有痛苦，你理解痛苦。萨姆和我只是在同一件事上开车，那就是，找一个和你以前的业务或者你现在的核心业务无关的人，想要开始使用它，这是非常重要的。

Philip: That makes sense.

菲利普：这是有道理的。

Sam: Any other issues you'd like to talk about? Any other questions?
Emma: I don't think so. I think that's our main thing that we know we need  to do right now.

山姆：你还想谈谈其他问题吗？还有其他问题吗？艾玛：我不这么认为。我认为这是我们现在需要做的主要事情。

Yuri: That's super exciting.

尤里：太令人兴奋了。

Sam: How did you decide about 15 percent as the amount to charge?
Emma: I think that's another thing we need to test out, but we feel like that's  a number that's not crazy for businesses to pay on top of something. My roommate  is a recruiter, and she gets 30 percent off of the top of all of  their salaries, but it's also enough for us to not have too many people to  start with, and be able to start testing things out.

山姆：你是怎么决定15%作为收费的？艾玛：我认为这是我们需要检验的另一件事，但我们觉得，对于企业来说，这个数字并不疯狂。我的室友是一名招聘人员，她从他们所有的薪水中得到了30%的好处，但这也足以让我们开始没有太多的人来开始测试。

Yuri: Is that a price that you're going to charge on top of the hourly rate,  or is that just going to be blended into the hourly rate?
Emma: Yeah. If somebody's $70 an hour, we'll add $15 dollars to that. Sorry, hundred dollars  an hour, we'll ad $15 to that.

尤里：这是你要在每小时收费的基础上收取的价格吗？还是把它和小时收费混为一谈？艾玛：是啊。如果有人每小时70美元，我们就加15美元。对不起，每小时一百美元，我们要加15美元。

Sam: This is a good problem to have in the future: what will prevent people from,  once they work with someone they like, just hiring them off the platform and not  paying you?
Emma: I think that's another thing that a lot of developers and designers have pointed out  to us, and I think we want to make sure that the tools inside of  the platform are keeping people there, so it's so easy for them to get work  and keep work, and they can do this on the side. Building internal tools that  allow people to work remotely and as contract workers will be another thing we're going  to focus on.

山姆：这是未来一个很好的问题：什么会阻止人们，一旦他们和喜欢的人一起工作，只是从平台上雇佣他们而不给你报酬？艾玛：我认为这是许多开发人员和设计师向我们指出的另一件事，我认为我们希望确保平台内的工具能够让人们保持在那里，所以他们很容易找到工作和工作，他们可以做到这一点。构建内部工具，使人们能够远程工作，并作为合同工工作，这将是我们关注的另一件事。

Philip: That's another thing that works well about the short-term projects.

菲利普：这是另一件对短期项目有效的事情。

Emma: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah.

艾玛：嗯-嗯(是的)，是的。

Yuri: All right.

尤里：好的。

Sam: Very cool.

山姆：很酷。

Yuri: Great, thank you very much.

尤里：太好了，非常感谢。

Philip: Thanks.

菲利普：谢谢。

Sam: Thank you.

山姆：谢谢。

Yuri: Nice to meet you.

尤里：很高兴见到你。

Philip: Thank you.

菲利普：谢谢。

Emma: Thank you.

艾玛：谢谢。

Yuri: Yeah.

尤里：是的。

Sam: Format-wise, that was an experiment. Is that something you'd like us to do more of  in the class? Was that useful? More regular lectures? Yes? Yes? Some middle? Okay, we'll  do some more of that then. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you Yuri.


山姆：从形式上讲，那是个实验。你想让我们在课堂上多做些什么吗？有用吗？更定期的讲座？是是中间的？好吧，那我们再做一些。太棒了非常感谢谢谢尤里。
