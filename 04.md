# How to Build a Product I with Michael Seibel, Emmett Shear and Steve Huffman

Michael Seibel: This is going to be the first of four lectures on how to build a  great product. I apologize because none of the people here today can speak to that  topic. My name is Michael. I'm the CEO of YC and help run the ,  as most of you understand YC to be. This here is Steve, who's co-founder and  CEO of Reddit, and there is Emmett, who is co-founder and CEO of Twitch. Can  you guys introduce yourselves in a couple seconds?
Steve Huffman: You just did, but I can do it again. I'm Steve, co-founder and CEO of  Reddit. I started computer science, graduated from UVA in 2005. I was at Reddit for  five years, I left for five years, I've been back for about a year and  a half.
Emmett Shear: My name is Emmett. I graduated from Yale, computer science, in 2005. I started my  first company right out of college. We made a bad copy of Google Calendar before  Google Calendar existed ...
Steve Huffman: Google Calendar copied you.
Emmett Shear: Yeah, that's right. Then we started Justin.tv, which is the company that wound up turning  into Twitch, and so I've been doing ... Basically continuously employed working on that since  2006.
Michael Seibel: Can you just, each of you guys say whatever the KPI you guys track for  the business and approximately what it is, just to give folks a sense of why  you guys might be experts at building great products.
Steve Huffman: One of our more sharable ones is monthly active users. We hit 300 million last  month.
Emmett Shear: Nice.
Michael Seibel: That's a good number.
Emmett Shear: Our primary metric that we care about is a metric called "minutes watched." It's the  number of minutes of video that are consumed every month on Twitch. We just crossed  three billion minutes this year for the first time, which is very exciting.
Steve Huffman: ?
Emmett Shear: No, per month.
Michael Seibel: Jesus.
Steve Huffman: Damn.
Michael Seibel: Jesus.
Emmett Shear: That's the main thing we look at rather than .
Michael Seibel: What we're going to do for you guys today is I have about 12 questions  I'm going to ask these guys. We're going to see how many of them we  get through and then we're going to leave the last 10 minutes for questions about  startup stuff, YC, or whatever else you'd like to talk about. My goal is to  kind of focus this advice on early, early stage. These guys do a lot of  stuff now that really is completely irrelevant to you, but hopefully, they'll be talking to  you about the things they did, bad or good, when they were starting. I want  to start with one of the major tenets of YC is how do you talk  ... Is talking to users. We repeat that a bunch of times and then we  don't really go into any detail. Can you guys talk a little bit about how  you talk to users? Maybe the good and maybe some of the mistakes you've made  as well.
Steve Huffman: Sure. Most of the advice I give today will have two perspectives. One at Reddit  and one at Hipmunk, because the companies are completely different. It had different paths and  I think the ground rules for this discussion, the first piece of advice I would  give is every company is really different and there're lots of different paths you can  take. What works in one place very likely won't work in another. At Reddit, the  product is talking to users. That was built in. In the early days, we didn't  have comments and we didn't have communities, so actually, we got a lot of emails.  It was our ... For the first probably six months, was the way we communicated  to our users. But when we added the comment feature, there was basically no option  but to talk to our users. The challenge then becomes which users do you want  to listen to, and what are they actually saying, and what do they actually mean,  because they're often saying one thing and they mean something else. At Hipmunk, because we  were selling plane tickets and hotel reservations, it was completely different. We didn't really have  a good forum for connecting with our users. We used a product called Olark, which  was basically this embedded JavaScript chat thing, and that was indispensable. We still use it.  Users, if they got stuck, they could ask us for help. If they wanted to  ... Like, it was compliments or criticisms, they could do that, and we can often,  both over email at Reddit and over Olark at Hipmunk, turn ... Emotional users, angry  users, often will become your most loyal users if you can flip them around. There's  this absolute value of emotion, and so if you can find those angry users who  are having a bad time and treat them well, they will likely turn into some  of your most loyal supporters. We found that whole cycle to be very valuable.
Emmett Shear: The interesting thing for me between Twitch and Justin.tv, which are two very similar products,  right? They're both live video products with chat. For Justin.tv, we were our own users.  We were building a product for us to build a TV show, and after that,  we really sort of declined to actually speak to users in any significant way. Unsurprisingly,  all of the good ideas we had were things we came up with when we  were building it for ourselves, which sort of brings me to my first point about  talking to users, is it's possible, especially very early, to build a product for yourself.  If you truly are building something that is for you to use, that can be  super effective. You don't necessarily need to talk to anyone else. Eventually, you'll need to,  because you don't want to learn about people other than yourself, but for the first  three months, it's possible to build something that's just something that you want. But you  have to actually really want it. You can't be lying to yourself about that. It  can't be something that you think is cool. It has to be something you yourself  actually desperately want to use every day. Then we went through a long period in  the desert where we wandering about, not talking to users, not really using our own  product, and not building anything of value. The thing we did with Twitch that I  thought was really good for talking to users was we talked to them in person.  I'd done some amount of surveys and talking to users over email, and I found  that getting people on, at least on Skype, or if not, literally in person, changed  my depth of understanding of who they were. The other thing I would say about  it is that we focused down really hard on which of our users we cared  about, and we decided it was the broadcasters, and we decided not only was it  the broadcasters, it was the successful broadcasters. We didn't want to talk to people who  had two viewers, we wanted to talk to people who had 200 viewers. So we  went and talked to a bunch of broadcasters on the platform because we decided they  were the important ones. The other thing we did that was, I think, really valuable  is we decided it wasn't just people who were currently using our service, it was  people who we wanted to use our service. We talked to a bunch of people  who were streaming on other platforms rather than just already on Twitch, because the people  who have chosen to not use your product, especially if they have deliberately looked at  your product, decided it sucked, and went somewhere else, are some of the best people  to talk to because they know what's wrong with it. I actually think the most  valuable things I learned, especially early on, were from users who had tried Justin.tv, they  tried to use Stream, they tried Own3d, they tried YouTube, and they had a coherent  opinion as to why ours was not the one they chose. That was super valuable  because they really pointed at the details of where we were wrong.
Steve Huffman: Often, those details are smaller than you think.
Emmett Shear: Memorably, one of the biggest issues was we were not listed on the Team Liquid  StarCraft fan website. We lost maybe 3,000 broadcasters over that. We had to email them  and ask them to relist us because they didn't have us there. Tiny issue, but  really mattered to our users.
Steve Huffman: It's easy to run a company for years and then be like, "Oh, I should've  fixed this stupid one-day fix," if you don't talk to your users.
Michael Seibel: A lot of people talk about MVPs, minimum viable products. How many of you guys  have heard that term, MVPs? One of the challenges that I have is that when  folks like you apply to YC and get into YC, even though you know the  idea that you should be releasing something that's crappy, you don't do it. As a  result, users slow down, and oftentimes that prevents you from getting into YC or prevents  you from building and talking to customers. I think that what's interesting is that Justin.tv  and Reddit are actually pretty good examples of crappy MVPs, so can you guys describe  how the products worked in the beginning, or maybe how they only kind of worked?
Steve Huffman: Yeah. I think I wrote my first line of code on June 3rd or 4th,  2005 for Reddit, and we launched on June 22nd. I didn't even launch it. Paul  Graham linked to us from his blog without telling me. From then, it was on.  The good thing about that for us, in particular, is we didn't actually have a  vision for Reddit, for better or for worse, which would affect us in a lot  of different ways going forward. But as soon as we launched, that's when we started  to find a path and we just would kind of follow the users every day  as what do we think is best for the users, what do we think is  best for us, and just build towards that. We built a lot of loyalty through  those actions, and that would not have happened if we were sitting in our apartment  not launching. Because we launched, and then for the next six months, we just added  a ton of new features, only about probably 25% of which actually lasted more than  a day or two. There was stuff we thought was a great idea, like we  had these categories. I remember in July at some point, I made Alexis, my co-founder,  stay up all night one night categorizing every link that had ever been submitted to  Reddit, and the next morning, I was like ... We launched, I was like, "Eh,  it's not working. Take it off." If we had launched, we could've had that feature  until November and then launched and then wondered why it didn't work.
Emmett Shear: I think that Amazon actually has a really good saying about minimum viable products. They  like to call them ... What they're aiming for, a minimum remarkable product, which I  think gets more at what you're trying to accomplish, which is ... A viable product  brings into mind this whole ecosystem of support, like a viable organism that's got all  the things it needs to live. You don't actually want that. If you're launching something  that's actually self-sufficient, that's viable in a real ... This thing can go live on  its own sense, you definitely waited too long. This thing is going to be on  life support when you launch it, and you are the life support system. What you  actually want is you want something about the product when you launch it to be  actually good. You want to get to the point where you built something that maybe  at least one person in the world finds remarkably useful or remarkably good, and you  don't know, really, if you've gotten there until you put it in front of someone,  which is why you need to launch it so quickly. I think it's really important  to remember, like Dropbox, for example, one of the big YC successes, did not launch  an immediate product because they were building a backup system, and backup systems aren't allowed  to lose your data. The last thing you want to do if you're building backup  software is go rush something out that's going to lose your customers' data, because you  will never get that trust back. The minimum remarkable product for Dropbox was a video  basically saying, "Look at this awesome thing we're going to build," and getting people to  sign up for a newsletter, and that worked because the visual idea of what Dropbox  was going to do was super compelling. That would not have worked for Justin.tv. We  really needed to get something out in front of customers immediately, most importantly because we  really needed to produce this show. We had this idea we were going to go  build a show, and we basically did the minimum possible work, maybe a little less  than that, to get a show onto the internet. When we launched it, it could  only have one channel. The way that broadcasting worked, the only way we could actually  get it to work consistently is we had a Mac Mini running parallels, which is  a virtualization environment, for Windows XP where we had this piece of broadcasting software called  ...
Steve Huffman: Adobe something?
Emmett Shear: It had got bought by Adobe later. OnFlix? Onlot? I can't remember. Anyway. That we  were automating with Windows shell scripting to pick up the right camera input, and then  auto reboot if it went down, because it broke all the time because it was  a really software. That extremely jury-rigged thing worked. It put a video stream on the  internet. It was not a scale ... We could not scale that up to thousands  of streams. It was impossible. But we got something that at least was compelling to  at least one person onto the internet, and it was compelling to us. That was  a critical step for us, because before we did that, we basically weren't learning anything.
Steve Huffman: At Hipmunk, we, again, started in June 2010. I had given my co-founder basically this  ultimatum of what our MVP was. We have to have legit data, because we could  scrape anybody. We needed legit data, real data, and when a customer buys a flight,  we get revenue. I was like, "If we can do that in three months, we  will continue with this business, and if we can't launch that in three months, we're  calling it." That, for me, the MVP, that was that minimum useful thing. If we  had customers giving us money, that meant we did something right. Unfortunately, we actually achieved  that in three months, so I worked on it for five years. I think it's  good, sometimes, to set yourself deadlines and specific milestones to keep you focused and keep  you pointed in the right direction.
Michael Seibel: Another thing that comes up a lot, and this is actually one of the things  that hits the ... When a company gets into YC, is we will often ask  them what are they doing for analytics? What are they tracking? I think that this  is another one of those MVP-like things. Everyone knows they should be doing it, and  it's the first thing that gets cut off of any list. Can you guys talk  about how an early-stage startup should think about measuring what analytics tool should they be  using? And generally, how you incorporate tracking into building product.
Steve Huffman: All right, I have two very different answers, so the reality is somewhere in between.  At Reddit, we just didn't. We didn't know our traffic for years, we didn't measure  anything ... The product development by intuition for a very long time. Company ended up  working out. I'm still not quite sure exactly how many users we have, and it's  a huge, huge pain in the ass now.
Michael Seibel: How many users you have?
Steve Huffman: When you get to 300 million, it's like ... I, you know.
Emmett Shear: No, in all seriousness, we have no idea how many unique people use the site  every month.
Steve Huffman: It's probably somewhere between 250 and 320. Anyway, at Hipmunk, we were actually really good  about it from day one. We were really ... Because we didn't have that kind  of instant feedback with our users, we actually got really disciplined about testing and analytics  and measuring and watching. That company lasted, honestly, quite a bit longer than I think  it would have without doing that. If I could do it again, there are a  lot of corners you can cut when you're building your MVP. You can create all  sorts of tech sins and corporate sins and, I don't know, be completely dysfunctional. Users  don't care. But data debt can haunt you, because you can't make up missing data.  Eventually, your intuition's going to fail you, so I would think very carefully about what's  the minimum viable data. You don't even have to look at it. Just log it  somewhere so it's there when you need it.
Emmett Shear: To reinforce that point, having historical baselines for important user actions ... You will thank  yourself later. Every time I've ever been like, "Oh, right. How many people are using  that feature?" And we don't know, and we can't find out, and now, even if  we find out how much it is now, we don't know if that's up a  lot or down a lot. We have no idea what the trends are. It's awful,  and you then can't make a decision for another three to six months as you  build that baseline. Actually, I got the best advice about this from Suhail, who runs  Mixpanel, when he was convincing us to try Mixpanel for the first time. Which, by  the way, didn't work because Mixpanel, at that time, was only six months old and  it broke when we tried to insert everything. But we went back to it.
Steve Huffman: Thanks for convincing me to use Mixpanel before you came to that conclusion though.
Emmett Shear: Yeah, you're welcome.
Steve Huffman: As I recall.
Michael Seibel: It works better now.
Emmett Shear: It works a lot better now. We went back to it. We're still on Mixpanel  today. We use a bunch of other stuff too because we're a little too big  for just Mixpanel. The advice Suhail gave me that was, I think, more important than  the software or using Mixpanel specific, even though I do think it's good software ...  Was pick your top five to seven most important user actions, whatever those are, and  just log those. You don't need to log everything. You really don't. Most of things  people are going to do with your product aren't important. There's maybe five things people  can do ... Like for Reddit, Reddit might be vote on something, comment on something,  submit a story, load a page. I don't know. Some short list of things. Those  are important, and you can kind of just ignore everything else. If it's not ,  then who cares? We instrumented ... I watched a minute of video, I sent a  chat message, I followed a stream, and I bought a subscription. Those four actions gave  us a huge amount of insight to what was going on with our customers that  we hadn't had before.
Steve Huffman: This is one of those areas where if I could go back and give myself  just advice for 30 minutes that would dramatically affect the trajectory of a company, it  would be around this topic. If I were in your shoes, I would just take  half a day and just read best practices for collecting events and story .
Emmett Shear: Yeah. The other thing I'd recommend is use a third party service. Collect logs, by  all means, put them into your own system, because I guarantee you, you'll want to  do something the third party service doesn't allow at some point and you'll be super  annoyed if your data is only in the third party service. So collect logs, or  whatever, but just, in the beginning, you don't have time to mess around with building  analytics tools, so just used Mixpanel or use Google Analytics, or use whatever. Anything. They're  all better than what you need right now. Later on, you'll need something more complicated.  You don't need it today.
Michael Seibel: One of the challenges that happens usually after a company, in the early stages, starts  talking to their customers is they realize maybe there's a big disconnect between what they  thought their customers wanted and what they actually want. At YC, this usually comes to  us in office hours in terms of we call the "big redesign." Oh, everything about  our site's incorrect. We just basically need to rebuild it from scratch, or rebuild huge  components of it from scratch in order to start serving our customers. Needless to say,  this is a very ... How do I phrase this? Distracting and oftentimes not fruitful  exercise, but how do you see that type of challenge, of oh, man, we got  this feedback and we think we need to be going in a different direction now.  How do you deal with that kind of challenge?
Steve Huffman: That's a big one. I think you need to be clear whether you're talking about  tech or the product. I'll repeat what I said before, is your users don't care  about your tech. If you can move forward, leave that for another day. When you're  talking about redesigning your product ... You're probably in trouble because whatever habits led you  to build a product your customers don't like ... If you haven't addressed those habits,  you're probably going to build another product your customers don't like. I would make sure  that ... Because I've been through lots of rewrites. At Hipmunk, we rewrote our flight  and hotels probably half a dozen times each. At Reddit, we rewrote the tech a  bunch of times and we're redoing the UI and UX now with better habits and  better data. You want to make sure that you know something new, but honestly, I  would ... If you're in that situation, I would also go through another mental exercise  of, okay, what's the new MVP? It comes up in tech a lot, the second  system syndrome. The same thing happens in the product where you're like, "All right, I've  got this vision, I'm going to fix all of the products, all of the mistakes  at once, and it's going to be perfect." That product never ships. It never ships.  Can you iterate your way there? Can you just start from scratch with an MVP  and build it back up? Those are much more likely to actually get you somewhere,  but they're also harder to do and requires a little bit more discipline.
Emmett Shear: We've also went through a bunch of redesigns, like big redesigns where you have to  rebuild the whole product. They've been mixed, actually. We've had some that were super successful.  Twitch did a big redesign of our mobile app, maybe three years ago, from the  first version that had basically been a cloned version of the Justin.tv app to a  completely new version. It's basically the version you can use today. That increased engagement by  like 35, 40% per customer when we launched it. It's huge. Changes that make that  big of an impact are actually really rare.
Steve Huffman: Usually data errors.
Emmett Shear: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're usually data errors, and in this case, it wasn't. This case,  it actually was a huge increase in usage. Absolutely, redesigns can make a big difference.  We didn't do that redesign because we'd discovered, oh, we couldn't move forward on our  existing product. We got some insight as to what thing should be presented on the  top of a nav, and we redid the navigation to present those things at the  top level instead of burying them three clicks deep. Three touches deep, I should say.  Most of the time, when I see people doing a big redesign, it's because they've  fallen into this trap that engineers and product managers often fall into, which is, "Oh,  we have to fix these eight things. Let's just fix them all at once; it'll  be easier." That's wrong. You should just fix them each one at a time, individually.  If you have eight things that are wrong with your product, that's awesome. You have  this huge, great list of things ... Just fix them one at a time. Fix  everything one at a time. Crank them out quickly. You'll get there way faster one  change at a time than you will in a big rewrite. A big rewrite for  a really early-stage startup is almost equivalent to pivoting a company, and I generally advise  against it.
Steve Huffman: It's this weird sort of programmer product procrastination. If don't know what to do, therefore  I'm going to invent this big project to work on. We don't need to use  that library, I'm going to build it myself. Very common. Use the damn library. Yeah.
Michael Seibel: I'd like to talk a little bit about decision making. Maybe after you talk to  your users but before you decide what to build, usually there has to be some  type of consensus-building process, either functional or dysfunctional, between the co-founders. What are some tips  or tricks around how to come to a consensus? Then, maybe more importantly, how do  you deal with the contrarian? How do you deal with having to make a decision  where you know there's going to be a disagreement?
Emmett Shear: Well, I think the first thing you said is actually super important. It's the thing  I want to reinforce. You talk to your users first, and then you have the  ideas about the product. Almost everyone does it in the opposite order. It's called product  validation. If you find yourself thinking, "I'm going to go talk to my users to  validate my product idea," you've gone horribly off the rails. You do it in the  other order. You don't talk to users to validate your product ideas. You talk to  our users to have your product ideas. I just have a rule, in general, for  people who want to have a voice in product design. They better to talk to  the users and look at the data too. If you haven't talked to users and  you haven't looked at data, you don't get to have a opinion about the product.  I'm sorry. The person who's actually done the work gets to have the opinion. You  can have ideas, but they get to make the call. But in the case you  wind up where both people really have talked to the users, and both people really  have looked at the data, and people still disagree as to what we should build  ... Which, by the way, is actually much more rare. Once both people have actually  talked to users and actually looked at the data, it's usually relatively easy to get  to consensus. But it will come up where people still disagree. I've found it's better  when you just have someone who's in charge. At the end of the day, you  have someone who's the CEO and everyone agrees this person's judgment will be trusted, and  you let them make the call. You know? Don't avoid conflict. Talk about it, argue  about it, but then, you have someone who just gets to make the call, because  anything else leads to ... Just decision-making that's far too slow for a startup.
Steve Huffman: Yeah. Maybe it's because I'm usually the one in charge, I just feel like I  don't have a lot of disagreements. There are ...
Emmett Shear: Meet the CEO.
Steve Huffman: Yeah. Largely, I find the situation I'm in, I say one of two things a  lot, which is, "I don't want to argue about it if we can just test  it." And, "I'm very willing to be surprised on this. I'm probably right, but this  isn't getting into my top three important things to worry about today, so let's just  see." It's easy to do that when you have more resources to "let's just see."  But I think, like Alexis and I over the years, and Adam and I over  the years at Hipmunk ... I think as Emmett pointed out, we very rarely had  these philosophical differences over the product. Sometimes it was timing, like should we build this  thing now? What's the prioritization of these things? But we always agreed on general mechanics  of what we were doing and why we were doing it. The strategy might change,  but the actual ... The details were very rarely not emotional. If those are getting  emotional, I think there's probably something else structurally wrong. You might be swimming upstream. That  happens a lot. You know, the arguments I've gotten in at Reddit over the last  year, like when we tried to promote ... We do cross-promotion from mobile web to  the app. It just doesn't feel great. It works. It works and we like the  numbers going up, but it's not really with the user's best intention in mind all  the time. Sometimes it drifts into the "it's good for the company, but maybe not  for the users." When you're in those situations, that's usually when the disagreements come out.  You're not really arguing about the feature anymore, you're arguing about short-term or long-term, or  best for the business or best for the users. When you beat at it, and  beat at it, and beat at it, eventually, you come to a solution that actually  feels right, and it meets your intuition, and you don't feel like you're fighting the  technology, you're not fighting the users anymore, those are usually situations I look out for.
Michael Seibel: I want to get to you guys telling product story, but I want to cover  one topic first, which is that ... Let's take people past launch where now you  need to have some type of process around talking to users, looking at data, making  a decision, building a product, releasing a product, checking your success, and repeating product development  cycle ... What are some advice you can give to early-stage startups around how to  set that up, what that cadence should be, maybe some pitfalls to avoid?
Steve Huffman: The first, just to take one little step back, is ... I see a lot  of startups get too emotionally high when the numbers are going up, and they're not  investing in this sort of process, because growth masks all problems. At some point, that  kind of stops and you don't have any of these mannerisms. I also see startups  get a little too low when things aren't going right at first, and they kind  of psyche themselves out. You want to live in that in-between. If the data's really  good, well, check the data. If the data's really bad, check the data. Okay. Then,  in terms of the actual process, first of all, it's going to be different at  every company, and it's going to change as you scale. I think it's just most  important to have a way of working, to have ... If you just want to  start out really, really specific of ... The way I like to think about it  is where do we want to be in a year? Okay? Let's draw a straight  line from that to here. What do we need to be doing today to get  there in a year? That's how I like our hypothesis. We need to validate anything  about that, probably a few things here or there, do that. Does it check out?  Yes. And then it's just straight line. I like to work on two-week cycles. Check  in every week on basically that kind of thing, like, where do we want to  be in a year? Are we still on track? Are we still doing the right  thing? Does it still make sense? Are our assumptions still holding to be true? If  not, pop it up a stack. Then you give people whatever it is ... If  you're early startup, you give them 13 days to work. If you're a more mature  startup, you give them nine days to work, and then keep going after that. I  found that that's really worked really well for me.
Emmett Shear: One thing I found, actually, is that your goal of talking to users shouldn't be  course corrections on a week-to-week basis. I did a whole crap ton of talking to  users at the very start of Twitch, trying to figure out what the users wanted,  how to think about them. We didn't, because we had other reasons to talk to  users, but we could've gone six months without talking to user because we actually ...  We knew what users wanted. They wanted to make money on the service. Streamers wanted  to make money, they wanted to reach more viewers, and they wanted positive social feedback  for what they were doing. You kind of just check anything you were doing, is  this going to deliver this to our streamers? Yes or no? If so, how much?  Great. You don't have to talk to anybody. You already know what they want. And  you need to go back and revisit it and sort of talk to users periodically,  because you need to understand more of the nuances of are the things about your  service that are bugging them, is someone else doing something really cool? The goal of  talking to users is not to get them to tell you what features to build,  because users are really bad at that. They actually have no idea what features to  build. The goal of talking to users is to get to understand them really well,  and users don't change that fast. I personally prefer more in-depth time with my customers,  talking to them for a while. Then, depending on the size of the thing we  need to do or trying to move, we might go just work and build and  look at metrics for the next six months and not actually talk to users that  much for a while. Because if you know that what people want is to make  more money, you can spend six months optimizing the sell through rate on an object  or on how much advertising you have, and you just can have faith that it's  going to be good and you will be rewarded.
Steve Huffman: I think the classic advice that's very difficult to follow is you need to have  courage of your convictions. You decide what you're going to build. It might six months  to build it, and at Reddit, we just kind of do it in front of  everybody and get flamed by our users the whole time, which is fine. I'm used  to it, but I have to kind of tell our product people, just keep pushing.  Keep pushing. Just ship a little bit every week, and then at six months, they'll  get it. At the same time, the completely contradictory advice is you have to know  when you're wrong. You have to be able to identify when you're wrong. You have  to be able to say, "All of you people are wrong, and I'm right," and  at some point, you have to decide, "Oh, wait. No, you're right." If you can  walk that line, you need to have this good combination of high ego and high  humility and balance those. But I always try to just run this process in my  head, "Wait, am I wrong? Nope, they're still wrong."
Emmett Shear: You don't have to talk to your users every week. It's totally unnecessary. You do  need to look at your numbers every week. You don't even need to look at  them every day. It's actually pointless and almost just ego gratification to look at your  numbers every day, but you should look at your numbers every single week. You should  confront, are they up or down, and ask yourself why. The holy grail of product  design is for your numbers to move, and for you to truly understand why they  moved. We still struggle with that. There have been points where I felt like I  understood it, and then it slips away again as the business gets more complicated. But  you're always trying to be able to explain, fully, down to atomic ground truth ...  We are up 20% this week because we got this many more new devices and  our retention rate is this on those devices, and this is the conversion rates, and  if you do the math and you can explain it all the way down to  this new feature moved this conversion rate on this page by this amount, and therefore,  we are up. If you can really do that, it's super powerful. It's also really  hard, but you'll never get there if you don't build the intuition or just looking  at it every week.
Michael Seibel: In the last five minutes before we open for questions, can you guys walk through  a feature that is visible on your sites now? I'll let you choose, that's either  bad or good, and talk about the process of how it came to be.
Steve Huffman: I have a lot. I'll talk about one of my favorite ones. This is from  the early days of Reddit. The early days of Reddit was just links. Everything was  external. Eventually, we added comments, probably about six months in. The first comment was, "This  is the end of Reddit." That would be the first comment on every product we've  ever released. Users started doing this curious thing where they would ... On any post,  you could click on the link or you could click on the comments page to  go to the comments for that page. Our IDs for posts are just a ;  it's in the URL. Users would submit the URL that would represent the comment page  for the URL they're submitting. They would just take the newest post and increment by  one and submit that URL, so that you had a post that would link to  its own comments page. It was really cool, so we called those self-posts. Users were  doing this. I remember watching them doing and thinking this is really cool. I would've  never thought to do this. Sometimes they'd guess wrong. They'd submit a post to somebody  else's comment page, which was funny, and so ... Because our user base at the  time was fairly technical, the way we made this work is when you're submitting a  link, you would just type in the URL area, "self," and it would automatically do  that little circular thing for you. That was the beginning of self-posts on Reddit. Self-posts  are now 60% of our content. I don't know, a few million a day. We  would've never built that feature if we hadn't been watching our users. I mean, I'm  explaining it now, but if I explain that feature without it existing, I don't know  if it would make a ton of sense. Users, most of them didn't get it  at first, either. There were just like, "Comments are destroying this site," and, "There's not  even a link here. It's just comments." It just kind of goes to show, I  think, the best product ideas are the ones where your users are doing it anyway,  and you just grease it a little bit. That's when I talk about before where  you're either swimming upstream, or just everything just feels right. That was a classic example  of it just felt right, and it completely changed the site.
Emmett Shear: I think my favorite story here is an advertising product, actually, which is funny. All  of our users told us really, really clearly, "We want to show advertising and make  money off of our streams." That was a clear desire. Everybody wanted it. They also  told us their least favorite thing about our competitors' products was that they would show  these ads over the stream, and it would be disruptive to their users' experience, and  they hated it. It was very interesting, getting these two pieces of feedback, because they  both really wanted us to put ads. Sometimes different people, sometimes, actually, literally the same  people. Their biggest complaint about the opposing service was, "Competitor's service is annoying my viewers  with all these ads," and this is a hard nut to crack because you kind  of need to solve for both. You're not allowed to just give up as a  product manager and pick one. I'm really proud of our solution, which was we gave  them a button. We inverted it, and we gave the streamer the ability to hit  a button to run ads on their own channel. It's funny, because normally, you'd think  of that as something that will ... If you're uploading content to Facebook, you would  never press a button on that to show more ads to your friends, but because  we were cutting them in on the revenue, they were actually heavily incentivized to hit  this button. We basically got this paid workforce of people placing advertising in the downtime  of the stream. I'm really proud of that clever solution. I think it points at  something that I think is a really important principle of product design in general, which  is that you want to just try inverting all of your assumptions. We got stuck  on that advertising problem for a long time because we didn't want to make it  disruptive to the customer experience, and we couldn't figure out how to automate putting it  on the stream in a good way. At the same time, we really wanted to  show ads on the video stream. We had this implicitous assumption in our heads that  we had to figure out where to put the ad, and once we gave that  assumption up, it was much more clear what to do going forward. That's one of  those, I don't know, I'm just really proud of that product decision because it was  one of the things that made our broadcasters super happy and no one ... You  can't complain. You hit the button.
Michael Seibel: How many times is that button clicked every day now?
Emmett Shear: That's a really good question. I don't know the numbers offhand. A lot. It's clicked  very often. People really like that button because it's a "click the button, make $15  button." But they're also aware of the trade-off, which is that their viewers don't like  it when they hit the button too much. By putting that in their court, they  get to make the optimal trade-off for their stream in their situation.
Michael Seibel: All right. Those are my questions. I want to open it up to you guys,  happy to talk about product, happy to talk about YC stuff, whatever you'd like to  chat about. Go ahead.
Speaker 4: What about the process of discovering you had product/market fit, getting past that launch ,  and then discovering there's something sustainable beyond this for users that are really committed to  this?
Michael Seibel: Just to repeat the question, how did you know when you had product/market fit?
Steve Huffman: At Reddit, this is the nice scenario. We were growing despite not knowing anything about  our business, knowing little about our users, not really knowing how to run a business,  not having a ton of product sense, being down a lot. We were growing. That's  the nice scenario. That's a good one. At Hipmunk, our natural state was zero users.  I'm not sure we ever got product/market fit. The users who came to Hipmunk liked  it, but we had to fight for every single one of them. It's possible to  do that, but we were ... Again, I think that entire company, we were swimming  upstream. I remember the day we kind of realized that. We ran this survey of  why do you use Hipmunk, and we put a lot of effort into the product.  We thought it was a really good product. Legitimately, you could find a flight a  lot faster on us than our competitors. 35% of people said it's because of the  logo, and 50% of the people said because we had lower prices, which we didn't.  We made it. The company ran for five years and ended up selling just fine.  I think we were really fighting that one.
Michael Seibel: I think this is a huge misconception, by the way. Most of the companies that  apply to YC don't have product/market fit. Most of the companies on Demo Day don't  have product/market fit. Most companies die before product/market fit. A lot of people talk about  product/market fit as this organic step in the process. Oh, you raise angel and then  you get an office, and you hire some people, and you have product/market fit. You  would be surprised at how few companies ... Product/market fit is typically described as "you  are overwhelmed with demand for your product."
Emmett Shear: Yeah. It's really obvious when you've hit product/market hit. Your product is bad. You can  point at seven things that are broken about it, and you have all these features  you know you need to build, and weirdly, it's growing really fast anyways. It's really  obvious when you're product/market fit. Your product is growing like crazy, and you are spending  ... You don't get to fix any of the things that are broken or bad  about your product because you're spending all of your time fixing it as it scales.  The metaphor I use for startups is to this kind of Sisyphean, you're pushing this  boulder up a hill, and you're pushing the boulder, and you're pushing the boulder, and  you're pushing the boulder ... Product/markets fit is when you crest the hill. Your job  doesn't get easier, but it does change a lot, because now you're chasing the boulder  as it tries to roll away from you down the hill on the other side.  Now you're sprinting, flat out, trying to catch up, which is hard in its own  way, but it feels totally different. Because whereas before, you have this, "Oh, god, we're  like ..." Every inch is like ... As Steve was describing with Hipmunk, every inch  is like you're pushing this boulder and you're fighting for every inch. Now it's like,  "Oh, crap. If we don't keep up with this, it's going to run away from  us." That's a totally different feeling. You'll know.
Steve Huffman: Here's the problem. Eventually, you'll catch the boulder on the way down, and then you're  like, "Shit. I'm actually pushing it uphill again."
Emmett Shear: Yep. Oh, absolutely. That's just what happens. It's like asking, "How do you know if  you're in love?" Trust me, you know.
Steve Huffman: Yeah.
Michael Seibel: It's funny, is one of the major problems that YC companies have is how do  they stay small and lean and don't spend a lot of money, don't have a  lot of management overhead, don't have a lot of bills until they reach product/market fit.  One of the typical mistakes is confusing an angel round or a couple million dollars  in the bank for product/market fit. It's extremely common. All right, other questions?
Speaker 5: How do you recognize your first group of user? Yeah.
Michael Seibel: How do you recognize your first groups of users?
Steve Huffman: Reddit was easy. They were just like Alexis and I. Emmett was talking about the  intuition phase of building products. We were in that for a long time. Our users,  they read the same Paul Graham blog that we did. They were programmers like I  was, so it was really, really easy. Hipmunk, we were actually completely wrong about who  our users were. I don't know if we ever quite solved this problem. They solved  it through , which is we built a product for ourselves, like tech-savvy people who  travel a fair amount and can their own travel. But in reality, the only way  to make money in travels is sell to business travelers because they're the only one  who travels multiple times a year. Business travelers don't get to use things like Hipmunk  or Kayak, right? They use American Express and Concur. It took us, actually, a couple  years to synthesize that. We were just like, "Fuck."
Emmett Shear: I think there's two kinds of startups. There are startups that are building things for  themselves, and where your customer's easy to identify. It's you and people like you. And  there's startups building things for a third party of users, where you should arrive at  which customers are your customers through an analytic mode, through thinking about the problem. Twitch  was an analytic startup because I was a huge fan of watching game streaming, but  actually, I wasn't much of a streamer. I've never been much of a streamer, and  I basically dug in on Justin.tv and realized that 80% of the minutes watched were  coming from our top 200 streamers. I was like, "Oh, they're the most important people.  If we lose them, we lose everything. If we can get 200 more of them,  we'll be twice as big." It was sort of identified analytically that that was the  right group of users and those are the right customers. I think that you should  just know which one you are, and the most important thing there is that if  it's not for you and you're not legitimately building something for you and for you  to use, and you aren't a big group of people ... In this case, you  should absolutely use the analytic mode, and ... I don't know, it's different for every  single company.
Steve Huffman: Yeah.
Emmett Shear: But think hard about it. I don't know.
Steve Huffman: Yeah. But if it's not for you, your intuition is lying to you.
Emmett Shear: Yeah. Yes.
Steve Huffman: Every time.
Emmett Shear: Yes.
Steve Huffman: And you have to supplement it with data.
Emmett Shear: Yeah.
Steve Huffman: Or talking to your users, or whatever.
Michael Seibel: Shockingly, we're 100% on time. If everyone can thank these guys for coming out today,  appreciate it.
