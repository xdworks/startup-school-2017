# How to Build a Product I with Michael Seibel, Emmett Shear and Steve Huffman

Michael Seibel: This is going to be the first of four lectures on how to build a  great product.

MichaelSeibel：这将是关于如何建立一个伟大的产品的四次讲座中的第一次。

I apologize because none of the people here today can speak to that  topic. My name is Michael.

我很抱歉，因为今天在座的人都不能谈论这个话题。我叫迈克尔。

I'm the CEO of YC and help run the ,  as most of you understand YC to be. This here is Steve, who's co-founder and  CEO of Reddit, and there is Emmett, who is co-founder and CEO of Twitch. Can  you guys introduce yourselves in a couple seconds?

我是YC的首席执行官，帮助运营，因为你们大多数人都认为YC是这样的。这是史蒂夫，他是Reddit的联合创始人和首席执行官，还有Emmett，他是twitc的联合创始人和首席执行官。你们能在几秒钟内自我介绍一下吗？

Steve Huffman: You just did, but I can do it again.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：你刚刚做了，但我可以再做一次。

I'm Steve, co-founder and CEO of  Reddit.

我是史蒂夫，Reddit的联合创始人兼首席执行官。

I started computer science, graduated from UVA in 2005.

我开始了计算机科学，于2005年毕业于UVA。

I was at Reddit for  five years, I left for five years, I've been back for about a year and  a half.

我在Reddit工作了五年，离开了五年，我已经回来一年半了。

Emmett Shear: My name is Emmett.

埃米特·谢尔：我叫埃米特。

I graduated from Yale, computer science, in 2005.

我于2005年毕业于耶鲁大学计算机科学专业。

I started my  first company right out of college. We made a bad copy of Google Calendar before  Google Calendar existed ...

我刚从大学毕业就开了第一家公司。我们在谷歌日历存在之前就复制了一份糟糕的谷歌日历.

Steve Huffman: Google Calendar copied you.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：谷歌日历抄袭了你。

Emmett Shear: Yeah, that's right. Then we started Justin.tv, which is the company that wound up turning  into Twitch, and so I've been doing ... Basically continuously employed working on that since  2006.
Michael Seibel: Can you just, each of you guys say whatever the KPI you guys track for  the business and approximately what it is, just to give folks a sense of why  you guys might be experts at building great products.

埃米特·谢尔：是的，没错。然后我们开始了Justin.tv，这是一家最终变成Twitc的公司，所以我一直在做.自2006年以来，基本上一直在从事这方面的工作。MichaelSeibel：你们每个人都能说出你们所追踪的企业的KPI，以及大概是什么，只是为了让人们了解你们为什么会成为制造伟大产品的专家。

Steve Huffman: One of our more sharable ones is monthly active users. We hit 300 million last  month.

SteveHuffman：我们的一个更可共享的是每月活跃的用户。上个月我们达到了3亿。

Emmett Shear: Nice.
Michael Seibel: That's a good number.

埃米特·谢尔：不错。迈克尔·塞贝尔：这是个不错的数字。

Emmett Shear: Our primary metric that we care about is a metric called "minutes watched." It's the  number of minutes of video that are consumed every month on Twitch. We just crossed  three billion minutes this year for the first time, which is very exciting.

埃米特·谢尔：我们关心的主要指标是一个叫做“观察分钟”的指标。这是每个月在Twitc上消耗的视频分钟数。我们今年第一次超过了30亿分钟，这是非常令人兴奋的。

Steve Huffman: ?

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：？

Emmett Shear: No, per month.
Michael Seibel: Jesus.

埃米特·谢尔：不，每月。上帝啊。

Steve Huffman: Damn.
Michael Seibel: Jesus.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：该死。上帝啊。

Emmett Shear: That's the main thing we look at rather than .
Michael Seibel: What we're going to do for you guys today is I have about 12 questions  I'm going to ask these guys. We're going to see how many of them we  get through and then we're going to leave the last 10 minutes for questions about  startup stuff, YC, or whatever else you'd like to talk about. My goal is to  kind of focus this advice on early, early stage. These guys do a lot of  stuff now that really is completely irrelevant to you, but hopefully, they'll be talking to  you about the things they did, bad or good, when they were starting.

埃米特·谢尔：这是我们关注的主要问题，而不是。迈克尔·塞贝尔：我们今天要为你们做的是，我有大约12个问题要问这些家伙。我们将看到有多少人通过，然后我们将留下最后10分钟的问题，关于启动的东西，YC，或其他您想要谈论的东西。我的目标是把这个建议集中在早期，早期阶段。这些人现在做了很多与你完全无关的事情，但希望他们在开始的时候会和你谈论他们所做的事情，不管是坏的还是好的。

I want  to start with one of the major tenets of YC is how do you talk  ...

我想从YC的一个主要原则开始，那就是你怎么说话.

Is talking to users. We repeat that a bunch of times and then we  don't really go into any detail. Can you guys talk a little bit about how  you talk to users? Maybe the good and maybe some of the mistakes you've made  as well.

正在和用户交谈。我们重复了很多次，然后我们并没有深入到任何细节。你们能谈谈你们如何和用户交谈吗？也许是好的，也可能是你犯的一些错误。

Steve Huffman: Sure. Most of the advice I give today will have two perspectives. One at Reddit  and one at Hipmunk, because the companies are completely different.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：当然。我今天提出的大多数建议都有两种观点。一个在Reddit，一个在Hipmunk，因为两家公司完全不同。

It had different paths and  I think the ground rules for this discussion, the first piece of advice I would  give is every company is really different and there're lots of different paths you can  take. What works in one place very likely won't work in another. At Reddit, the  product is talking to users. That was built in.

它有不同的路径，我认为这次讨论的基本规则，我要给出的第一条建议是，每个公司都是不同的，你可以采取很多不同的途径。在一个地方起作用的东西很可能在另一个地方行不通。在Reddit，该产品正在与用户对话。是内置的。

In the early days, we didn't  have comments and we didn't have communities, so actually, we got a lot of emails.  It was our ... For the first probably six months, was the way we communicated  to our users. But when we added the comment feature, there was basically no option  but to talk to our users. The challenge then becomes which users do you want  to listen to, and what are they actually saying, and what do they actually mean,  because they're often saying one thing and they mean something else. At Hipmunk, because we  were selling plane tickets and hotel reservations, it was completely different. We didn't really have  a good forum for connecting with our users. We used a product called Olark, which  was basically this embedded JavaScript chat thing, and that was indispensable. We still use it.  Users, if they got stuck, they could ask us for help.

在早期，我们没有评论，也没有社区，所以实际上，我们收到了很多电子邮件。是我们的.。在最初的六个月里，我们与用户沟通的方式。但是，当我们添加评论功能时，基本上没有其他选择，只能与用户对话。接下来的挑战变成了你想听哪些用户，他们到底在说什么，因为他们经常说一件事，而他们的意思却是另一回事。在Hipmunk，因为我们在卖机票和预订酒店，所以情况完全不同了。我们没有一个很好的论坛与我们的用户联系。我们使用了一个名为Olark的产品，它基本上就是嵌入式JavaScript聊天的工具，这是必不可少的。我们还在用它。用户，如果他们被卡住了，他们可以向我们求助。

If they wanted to  ... Like, it was compliments or criticisms, they could do that, and we can often,  both over email at Reddit and over Olark at Hipmunk, turn ... Emotional users, angry  users, often will become your most loyal users if you can flip them around. There's  this absolute value of emotion, and so if you can find those angry users who  are having a bad time and treat them well, they will likely turn into some  of your most loyal supporters. We found that whole cycle to be very valuable.

如果他们想.。就像，赞美或批评，他们可以这样做，我们经常可以，无论是通过电子邮件在Reddit和Olark在Hipmunk，转向.情绪用户，愤怒的用户，往往会成为你最忠实的用户，如果你可以翻转他们。这是情感的绝对价值，所以如果你能找到那些愤怒的用户，他们过得很糟糕，并善待他们，他们很可能会变成你最忠实的支持者。我们发现整个周期非常有价值。

Emmett Shear: The interesting thing for me between Twitch and Justin.tv, which are two very similar products,  right? They're both live video products with chat. For Justin.tv, we were our own users.  We were building a product for us to build a TV show, and after that,  we really sort of declined to actually speak to users in any significant way. Unsurprisingly,  all of the good ideas we had were things we came up with when we  were building it for ourselves, which sort of brings me to my first point about  talking to users, is it's possible, especially very early, to build a product for yourself.  If you truly are building something that is for you to use, that can be  super effective. You don't necessarily need to talk to anyone else. Eventually, you'll need to,  because you don't want to learn about people other than yourself, but for the first  three months, it's possible to build something that's just something that you want. But you  have to actually really want it. You can't be lying to yourself about that.

埃米特·谢尔：对于我来说，Twit.tv和Justin.tv之间的有趣之处是，这两款产品非常相似，对吧？他们都是带聊天的现场视频产品。对于Justin.tv来说，我们是自己的用户。我们为我们制作了一个产品来制作一个电视节目，在那之后，我们实际上拒绝以任何重要的方式与用户对话。不出所料，我们所有的好点子都是我们在为自己构建产品时想出来的，这让我首先谈到了与用户对话的问题，尤其是在很早的时候，为自己开发一个产品是可能的。如果你真的在构建一个供你使用的东西，那是非常有效的。你不一定要和其他人说话。最终，你会需要这样做，因为你不想了解别人而不是你自己，但在最初的三个月里，你有可能建立一些你想要的东西。但你必须真的想要它。你不能在这件事上自欺欺人。

It  can't be something that you think is cool.

它不可能是你认为很酷的东西。

It has to be something you yourself  actually desperately want to use every day. Then we went through a long period in  the desert where we wandering about, not talking to users, not really using our own  product, and not building anything of value. The thing we did with Twitch that I  thought was really good for talking to users was we talked to them in person.  I'd done some amount of surveys and talking to users over email, and I found  that getting people on, at least on Skype, or if not, literally in person, changed  my depth of understanding of who they were. The other thing I would say about  it is that we focused down really hard on which of our users we cared  about, and we decided it was the broadcasters, and we decided not only was it  the broadcasters, it was the successful broadcasters. We didn't want to talk to people who  had two viewers, we wanted to talk to people who had 200 viewers. So we  went and talked to a bunch of broadcasters on the platform because we decided they  were the important ones. The other thing we did that was, I think, really valuable  is we decided it wasn't just people who were currently using our service, it was  people who we wanted to use our service. We talked to a bunch of people  who were streaming on other platforms rather than just already on Twitch, because the people  who have chosen to not use your product, especially if they have deliberately looked at  your product, decided it sucked, and went somewhere else, are some of the best people  to talk to because they know what's wrong with it.

它必须是你自己非常想每天使用的东西。然后我们在沙漠中度过了很长一段时间，在那里我们四处游荡，不和用户交谈，不真正使用我们自己的产品，也没有建造任何有价值的东西。我们对Twitc所做的事情，我认为对用户来说真的很好，那就是我们亲自和他们交谈。我做了一些调查，并通过电子邮件与用户交谈，我发现让人们上网，至少是通过Skype，或者如果不是面对面的话，改变了我对他们是谁的理解的深度。我要说的另一件事是，我们非常努力地关注我们关心的用户，我们决定是广播公司，我们决定不仅是广播公司，也是成功的广播公司。我们不想和有两个观众的人交谈，我们想和有200个观众的人交谈。所以我们去和平台上的一群播音员交谈，因为我们认为他们是重要的。我们所做的另一件事，我认为，非常有价值的是，我们决定不仅仅是那些正在使用我们服务的人，而是那些我们想要使用我们的服务的人。我们采访了一群在其他平台上进行流媒体的人，而不仅仅是在Twitc上，因为那些选择不使用你的产品的人，特别是如果他们故意看了你的产品，决定它失败了，然后去了其他地方，他们是最好的人，因为他们知道它的问题所在。

I actually think the most  valuable things I learned, especially early on, were from users who had tried Justin.tv, they  tried to use Stream, they tried Own3d, they tried YouTube, and they had a coherent  opinion as to why ours was not the one they chose. That was super valuable  because they really pointed at the details of where we were wrong.

我认为我学到的最有价值的东西，尤其是在早期，是从用户那里学到的，他们尝试过Justin.tv，他们尝试使用Stream，他们尝试了Own3D，他们尝试了YouTube，他们对为什么我们的不是他们选择的那个有着一致的看法。这是非常有价值的，因为他们确实指出了我们错在哪里的细节。

Steve Huffman: Often, those details are smaller than you think.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：这些细节往往比你想象的要小。

Emmett Shear: Memorably, one of the biggest issues was we were not listed on the Team Liquid  StarCraft fan website. We lost maybe 3,000 broadcasters over that. We had to email them  and ask them to relist us because they didn't have us there. Tiny issue, but  really mattered to our users.

埃米特·谢尔：令人难忘的是，最大的问题之一是我们没有被列在“星际争霸”的粉丝网站上。我们为此失去了大约3，000家广播公司。我们不得不给他们发电子邮件，并要求他们重新介绍我们，因为他们没有我们在那里。小问题，但真正重要的是我们的用户。

Steve Huffman: It's easy to run a company for years and then be like, "Oh, I should've  fixed this stupid one-day fix," if you don't talk to your users.
Michael Seibel: A lot of people talk about MVPs, minimum viable products. How many of you guys  have heard that term, MVPs? One of the challenges that I have is that when  folks like you apply to YC and get into YC, even though you know the  idea that you should be releasing something that's crappy, you don't do it. As a  result, users slow down, and oftentimes that prevents you from getting into YC or prevents  you from building and talking to customers.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：如果你不和你的用户交谈，你就很容易管理一家公司，然后就会说：“哦，我应该修正这个愚蠢的某一天的解决方案。”MichaelSeibel：很多人谈论MVP，最低限度可行的产品。你们中有多少人听过这个词，MVP？我面临的挑战之一是，当像你这样的人向YC申请并进入YC时，即使你知道你应该发布一些糟糕的东西，你也不会这么做。因此，用户会放慢速度，并且经常会阻止您进入YC或阻止您建立和与客户交谈。

I think that what's interesting is that Justin.tv  and Reddit are actually pretty good examples of crappy MVPs, so can you guys describe  how the products worked in the beginning, or maybe how they only kind of worked?

我认为有趣的是Justin.tv和Reddit实际上是糟糕的MVP的很好的例子，那么你们能描述这些产品在一开始是如何工作的吗？

Steve Huffman: Yeah.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：是的。

I think I wrote my first line of code on June 3rd or 4th,  2005 for Reddit, and we launched on June 22nd.

我想我在2005年6月3日或4日为Reddit编写了我的第一行代码，我们于6月22日发布了代码。

I didn't even launch it. Paul  Graham linked to us from his blog without telling me. From then, it was on.  The good thing about that for us, in particular, is we didn't actually have a  vision for Reddit, for better or for worse, which would affect us in a lot  of different ways going forward. But as soon as we launched, that's when we started  to find a path and we just would kind of follow the users every day  as what do we think is best for the users, what do we think is  best for us, and just build towards that. We built a lot of loyalty through  those actions, and that would not have happened if we were sitting in our apartment  not launching. Because we launched, and then for the next six months, we just added  a ton of new features, only about probably 25% of which actually lasted more than  a day or two. There was stuff we thought was a great idea, like we  had these categories.

我甚至没有启动它。保罗·格雷厄姆通过他的博客和我们联系，但没有告诉我。从那以后就开始了。特别是对我们来说，好的方面是，我们并没有对Reddit的看法，无论是好是坏，这会在很多方面影响我们前进的方向。但一旦我们启动，那就是我们开始寻找一条道路的时候，我们每天都会跟踪用户，因为我们认为什么是对用户最好的，什么是我们认为对我们最好的，然后朝着这个方向努力。我们通过这些行动建立了很大的忠诚度，如果我们坐在自己的公寓里不启动，那就不会发生了。因为我们推出了，然后在接下来的六个月里，我们增加了大量的新功能，大概只有大约25%的功能真正持续了一到两天。有些东西我们认为是个好主意，就像我们有了这些分类。

I remember in July at some point, I made Alexis, my co-founder,  stay up all night one night categorizing every link that had ever been submitted to  Reddit, and the next morning, I was like ... We launched, I was like, "Eh,  it's not working. Take it off." If we had launched, we could've had that feature  until November and then launched and then wondered why it didn't work.

我记得在七月的某个时候，我让我的联合创始人亚历克西斯整晚熬夜，把提交给Reddit的每一个链接分类，第二天早上，我就像.我们启动了，我说，“呃，它不起作用了，把它脱下来。”如果我们已经发布了，我们可以在11月份之前拥有这个功能，然后发布，然后想知道为什么它不起作用。

Emmett Shear: I think that Amazon actually has a really good saying about minimum viable products. They  like to call them ... What they're aiming for, a minimum remarkable product, which I  think gets more at what you're trying to accomplish, which is ... A viable product  brings into mind this whole ecosystem of support, like a viable organism that's got all  the things it needs to live. You don't actually want that.

埃米特·谢尔：我认为亚马逊其实对最低限度可行的产品有一个很好的说法。他们喜欢叫他们.。他们的目标，一个最低限度的卓越的产品，我认为更多的是你想要完成的，那就是.一个可行的产品会让人想起整个生态系统的支持，就像一个有生存能力的有机体，拥有它所需要的所有东西。你不会真的想要的。

If you're launching something  that's actually self-sufficient, that's viable in a real ... This thing can go live on  its own sense, you definitely waited too long. This thing is going to be on  life support when you launch it, and you are the life support system. What you  actually want is you want something about the product when you launch it to be  actually good. You want to get to the point where you built something that maybe  at least one person in the world finds remarkably useful or remarkably good, and you  don't know, really, if you've gotten there until you put it in front of someone,  which is why you need to launch it so quickly.

如果你推出的是自给自足的东西，那在现实中是可行的.这东西可以靠自己的感觉活下去，你肯定等得太久了。当你启动它的时候，这个东西就是生命维持系统，你就是生命维持系统。你真正想要的是，当你推出这个产品的时候，你想要的是一个好的东西。你想建立一个世界上至少有一个人觉得非常有用或非常好的东西，你真的不知道你是否已经做到了，直到你把它摆在别人面前，这就是为什么你需要这么快地启动它。

I think it's really important  to remember, like Dropbox, for example, one of the big YC successes, did not launch  an immediate product because they were building a backup system, and backup systems aren't allowed  to lose your data. The last thing you want to do if you're building backup  software is go rush something out that's going to lose your customers' data, because you  will never get that trust back. The minimum remarkable product for Dropbox was a video  basically saying, "Look at this awesome thing we're going to build," and getting people to  sign up for a newsletter, and that worked because the visual idea of what Dropbox  was going to do was super compelling. That would not have worked for Justin.tv. We  really needed to get something out in front of customers immediately, most importantly because we  really needed to produce this show. We had this idea we were going to go  build a show, and we basically did the minimum possible work, maybe a little less  than that, to get a show onto the internet. When we launched it, it could  only have one channel. The way that broadcasting worked, the only way we could actually  get it to work consistently is we had a Mac Mini running parallels, which is  a virtualization environment, for Windows XP where we had this piece of broadcasting software called  ...

我认为这是非常重要的，比如Dropbox，例如，YC的成功之一，没有立即推出产品，因为他们正在构建备份系统，备份系统是不允许丢失您的数据的。如果您正在构建备份软件，您最不想做的事情就是匆忙释放一些可能会丢失客户数据的东西，因为您将永远得不到这种信任。Dropbox最不寻常的产品是一段视频-基本上是说，“看看我们要做的这件了不起的事情，”然后让人们注册一份通讯，这很管用，因为Dropbox将要做什么的视觉想法是非常吸引人的。这对Justin.tv来说是行不通的。我们真的需要立即在客户面前得到一些东西，最重要的是因为我们真的需要制作这个节目。我们有这样的想法-我们要去制作一个节目-我们基本上做了尽可能少的工作，让一个节目在互联网上播出。当我们发射它时，它只能有一个频道。广播的工作方式，唯一能让它持续工作的方法是，我们让Mac Mini运行并行，这是一个虚拟化环境，在Windows XP中，我们有一个叫做…的广播软件.

Steve Huffman: Adobe something?

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：Adobe什么的？

Emmett Shear: It had got bought by Adobe later. OnFlix? Onlot? I can't remember. Anyway. That we  were automating with Windows shell scripting to pick up the right camera input, and then  auto reboot if it went down, because it broke all the time because it was  a really software. That extremely jury-rigged thing worked.

埃米特·谢尔：后来被Adobe收购了。OnFlix？翁洛特？我不记得了。不管怎么说。我们用Windows shell脚本自动获取正确的摄像头输入，然后自动重新启动，如果它坏了，因为它一直坏，因为它是一个真正的软件。那个极度操纵陪审团的东西起作用了。

It put a video stream on the  internet.

它在互联网上放了一个视频流。

It was not a scale ... We could not scale that up to thousands  of streams.

不是天平.。我们无法扩展到数千条溪流。

It was impossible. But we got something that at least was compelling to  at least one person onto the internet, and it was compelling to us. That was  a critical step for us, because before we did that, we basically weren't learning anything.

那是不可能的。但我们在互联网上得到的东西至少对至少一个人来说是有吸引力的，这对我们来说是很有吸引力的。这对我们来说是关键的一步，因为在我们这么做之前，我们基本上没有学到任何东西。

Steve Huffman: At Hipmunk, we, again, started in June 2010.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：在希普蒙德，我们又一次开始于2010年6月。

I had given my co-founder basically this  ultimatum of what our MVP was. We have to have legit data, because we could  scrape anybody. We needed legit data, real data, and when a customer buys a flight,  we get revenue.

我给了我的联合创始人这个最后通牒，我们的MVP是什么。我们必须有合法的数据，因为我们可以搜刮任何人。我们需要合法的数据，真实的数据，当客户购买一架飞机时，我们就能得到收入。

I was like, "If we can do that in three months, we  will continue with this business, and if we can't launch that in three months, we're  calling it." That, for me, the MVP, that was that minimum useful thing.

我说，“如果我们能在三个月内做到这一点，我们将继续做这项业务，如果我们在三个月内不能推出，我们就称之为。”对我来说，MVP，那是最起码的有用的东西。

If we  had customers giving us money, that meant we did something right. Unfortunately, we actually achieved  that in three months, so I worked on it for five years.

如果我们有顾客给我们钱，那就意味着我们做了正确的事情。不幸的是，我们在三个月内就实现了这一点，所以我花了五年的时间来研究它。

I think it's  good, sometimes, to set yourself deadlines and specific milestones to keep you focused and keep  you pointed in the right direction.
Michael Seibel: Another thing that comes up a lot, and this is actually one of the things  that hits the ... When a company gets into YC, is we will often ask  them what are they doing for analytics? What are they tracking? I think that this  is another one of those MVP-like things. Everyone knows they should be doing it, and  it's the first thing that gets cut off of any list. Can you guys talk  about how an early-stage startup should think about measuring what analytics tool should they be  using? And generally, how you incorporate tracking into building product.

我认为，有时候，给自己设定最后期限和具体的里程碑，让你保持专注，让你朝着正确的方向前进，这是很好的。迈克尔·塞贝尔：还有一件事经常发生，这实际上是其中一件事.当一家公司进入YC时，我们是否经常会问他们，他们在做什么？他们在追踪什么？我认为这是另一个类似MVP的东西。每个人都知道他们应该这么做，这是第一件被从名单中删除的事情。你们能谈谈早期创业公司应该如何考虑测量他们应该使用的分析工具吗？一般情况下，你是如何将跟踪融入到产品的构建中的。

Steve Huffman: All right, I have two very different answers, so the reality is somewhere in between.  At Reddit, we just didn't. We didn't know our traffic for years, we didn't measure  anything ... The product development by intuition for a very long time. Company ended up  working out.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：好吧，我有两个完全不同的答案，所以现实就在两者之间。在Reddit，我们就是没有。我们好几年都不知道我们的交通状况，我们什么都没测量.产品开发是凭直觉进行了很长一段时间。公司的工作结束了。

I'm still not quite sure exactly how many users we have, and it's  a huge, huge pain in the ass now.
Michael Seibel: How many users you have?

我仍然不太确定我们有多少用户，这是一个巨大的痛苦的屁股。迈克尔·塞贝尔：你有多少用户？

Steve Huffman: When you get to 300 million, it's like ...

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：当你到了3亿的时候，就像.

I, you know.

我，你知道的。

Emmett Shear: No, in all seriousness, we have no idea how many unique people use the site  every month.

埃米特·谢尔：不，严肃地说，我们不知道每个月有多少人使用这个网站。

Steve Huffman: It's probably somewhere between 250 and 320. Anyway, at Hipmunk, we were actually really good  about it from day one. We were really ... Because we didn't have that kind  of instant feedback with our users, we actually got really disciplined about testing and analytics  and measuring and watching. That company lasted, honestly, quite a bit longer than I think  it would have without doing that.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：大概在250到320之间。不管怎么说，在Hipmunk，我们从第一天起就对此非常满意。我们真的.。因为我们没有得到用户的即时反馈，所以我们实际上在测试、分析、测量和观看方面受到了严格的约束。老实说，那家公司的持续时间比我想的要长得多。

If I could do it again, there are a  lot of corners you can cut when you're building your MVP. You can create all  sorts of tech sins and corporate sins and, I don't know, be completely dysfunctional. Users  don't care. But data debt can haunt you, because you can't make up missing data.  Eventually, your intuition's going to fail you, so I would think very carefully about what's  the minimum viable data. You don't even have to look at it. Just log it  somewhere so it's there when you need it.

如果我能再做一次，当你建立你的MVP的时候，有很多的角落你可以削减。你可以制造各种技术上的罪恶和公司的罪恶，我不知道，完全不正常。用户不在乎。但是数据债务会困扰你，因为你无法弥补丢失的数据。最终，你的直觉会让你失望，所以我会非常仔细地考虑什么是最小的可行数据。你甚至不用看。只要把它记录在某个地方，当你需要它的时候，它就在那里。

Emmett Shear: To reinforce that point, having historical baselines for important user actions ... You will thank  yourself later. Every time I've ever been like, "Oh, right. How many people are using  that feature?" And we don't know, and we can't find out, and now, even if  we find out how much it is now, we don't know if that's up a  lot or down a lot. We have no idea what the trends are.

埃米特剪切：为了加强这一点，有重要用户行动的历史基线.你以后会感谢你自己的。每次我说，“哦，是的，有多少人在使用这个功能？”我们不知道，我们也找不到，现在，即使我们知道现在是多少，我们也不知道它是涨了还是跌了很多。我们不知道趋势是什么。

It's awful,  and you then can't make a decision for another three to six months as you  build that baseline. Actually, I got the best advice about this from Suhail, who runs  Mixpanel, when he was convincing us to try Mixpanel for the first time. Which, by  the way, didn't work because Mixpanel, at that time, was only six months old and  it broke when we tried to insert everything. But we went back to it.

这太糟糕了，当你建立这个基线的时候，你就不能再下三到六个月的决定了。事实上，当他说服我们第一次尝试MixPanel时，我得到了关于这个问题的最好建议，他是MixPanel的负责人。顺便说一句，它不起作用，因为当时的MixPanel，只有六个月大，当我们试图插入所有的东西时，它就坏了。但我们还是回去了。

Steve Huffman: Thanks for convincing me to use Mixpanel before you came to that conclusion though.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：不过，在你得出这个结论之前，谢谢你说服我使用混合面板。

Emmett Shear: Yeah, you're welcome.

埃米特·谢尔：是的，不客气。

Steve Huffman: As I recall.
Michael Seibel: It works better now.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：我记得。迈克尔·塞贝尔：现在效果更好了。

Emmett Shear: It works a lot better now. We went back to it. We're still on Mixpanel  today. We use a bunch of other stuff too because we're a little too big  for just Mixpanel. The advice Suhail gave me that was, I think, more important than  the software or using Mixpanel specific, even though I do think it's good software ...  Was pick your top five to seven most important user actions, whatever those are, and  just log those. You don't need to log everything. You really don't. Most of things  people are going to do with your product aren't important. There's maybe five things people  can do ... Like for Reddit, Reddit might be vote on something, comment on something,  submit a story, load a page.

埃米特·谢尔：现在好多了。我们回去了。我们今天还在混合面板上。我们也使用了一些其他的东西，因为我们对混合面板来说有点太大了。苏哈伊尔给我的建议，我认为，比软件更重要，或使用混合面板的具体，尽管我确实认为它是好的软件.选择你最重要的五到七个最重要的用户动作，不管它们是什么，然后记录它们。你不需要记录一切。你真的不知道。大多数人要用你的产品做的事情并不重要。也许人们可以做五件事.。就像Reddit一样，Reddit可能会对某件事进行投票，对某件事发表评论，提交一个故事，加载一个页面。

I don't know. Some short list of things. Those  are important, and you can kind of just ignore everything else.

我不知道一些简短的事情清单。这些都很重要，你可以忽略其他的一切。

If it's not ,  then who cares? We instrumented ...

如果不是，那谁在乎呢？我们用仪器.。

I watched a minute of video, I sent a  chat message, I followed a stream, and I bought a subscription. Those four actions gave  us a huge amount of insight to what was going on with our customers that  we hadn't had before.

我看了一分钟的视频，发了一条聊天短信，跟着一条小溪，我买了一个订阅。这四项行动给了我们大量的洞察力，让我们了解到我们以前从未遇到过的客户发生了什么。

Steve Huffman: This is one of those areas where if I could go back and give myself  just advice for 30 minutes that would dramatically affect the trajectory of a company, it  would be around this topic.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：这是一个领域，如果我能回去给自己30分钟的建议，这会极大地影响一个公司的发展轨迹，它将围绕着这个话题。

If I were in your shoes, I would just take  half a day and just read best practices for collecting events and story .

如果我站在你的立场上，我只会花半天时间来阅读收集事件和故事的最佳实践。

Emmett Shear: Yeah. The other thing I'd recommend is use a third party service. Collect logs, by  all means, put them into your own system, because I guarantee you, you'll want to  do something the third party service doesn't allow at some point and you'll be super  annoyed if your data is only in the third party service. So collect logs, or  whatever, but just, in the beginning, you don't have time to mess around with building  analytics tools, so just used Mixpanel or use Google Analytics, or use whatever. Anything. They're  all better than what you need right now. Later on, you'll need something more complicated.  You don't need it today.
Michael Seibel: One of the challenges that happens usually after a company, in the early stages, starts  talking to their customers is they realize maybe there's a big disconnect between what they  thought their customers wanted and what they actually want. At YC, this usually comes to  us in office hours in terms of we call the "big redesign." Oh, everything about  our site's incorrect. We just basically need to rebuild it from scratch, or rebuild huge  components of it from scratch in order to start serving our customers. Needless to say,  this is a very ... How do I phrase this? Distracting and oftentimes not fruitful  exercise, but how do you see that type of challenge, of oh, man, we got  this feedback and we think we need to be going in a different direction now.  How do you deal with that kind of challenge?

埃米特·谢尔：是的。我建议的另一件事是使用第三方服务。收集日志，无论如何，将它们放到您自己的系统中，因为我向您保证，您会想要做第三方服务在某个时候不允许的事情，如果您的数据仅在第三方服务中，您会非常恼火。所以收集日志，或者其他什么，但在开始的时候，你没有时间去处理构建分析工具，所以只使用MixPanel或者使用GoogleAnalytics，或者使用任何东西。什么都行它们都比你现在需要的好。稍后，你需要更复杂的东西。你今天不需要它。MichaelSeibel：通常在一家公司的早期阶段，开始和他们的客户交谈之后，他们会遇到的挑战之一是他们意识到，他们认为客户想要的东西和他们真正想要的东西之间可能有很大的脱节。在YC，这通常出现在我们的办公时间，我们称之为“大的重新设计”。我们网站上的一切都不对。我们基本上需要从头开始重建它，或者从头开始重建它的庞大组件，以便开始为我们的客户服务。不用说，这是一个非常.我该怎么说呢？分散注意力，而且往往没有成效，但是你是如何看待这种挑战的，哦，伙计，我们收到了这样的反馈，我们认为我们现在需要朝着一个不同的方向发展。你如何应对这种挑战？

Steve Huffman: That's a big one.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：这是个大问题。

I think you need to be clear whether you're talking about  tech or the product.

我认为你需要弄清楚你是在谈论科技还是产品。

I'll repeat what I said before, is your users don't care  about your tech.

我会重复我之前说过的，你的用户不关心你的技术。

If you can move forward, leave that for another day. When you're  talking about redesigning your product ... You're probably in trouble because whatever habits led you  to build a product your customers don't like ...

如果你能继续前进，那就留到另一天吧。当你说要重新设计你的产品时.。你可能有麻烦了，因为不管是什么习惯导致你制造出你的客户不喜欢的产品.

If you haven't addressed those habits,  you're probably going to build another product your customers don't like.

如果你没有解决这些习惯，你可能会制造另一个你的客户不喜欢的产品。

I would make sure  that ... Because I've been through lots of rewrites. At Hipmunk, we rewrote our flight  and hotels probably half a dozen times each. At Reddit, we rewrote the tech a  bunch of times and we're redoing the UI and UX now with better habits and  better data. You want to make sure that you know something new, but honestly, I  would ...

我会确保.。因为我经历了很多重写。在Hipmunk，我们重写了我们的航班和旅馆，大概每一次都有六次。在Reddit，我们重写了大量的技术，现在我们用更好的习惯和更好的数据重新创建UI和UX。你想确保你知道一些新的东西，但说实话，我会.

If you're in that situation, I would also go through another mental exercise  of, okay, what's the new MVP? It comes up in tech a lot, the second  system syndrome. The same thing happens in the product where you're like, "All right, I've  got this vision, I'm going to fix all of the products, all of the mistakes  at once, and it's going to be perfect." That product never ships.

如果你在这种情况下，我还会进行另一次心理锻炼，好吧，新的MVP是什么？它经常出现在科技界，第二个系统综合症。同样的事情也发生在产品中，你会说，“好吧，我有了这样的愿景，我要同时修复所有的产品，所有的错误，而且它将是完美的。”那种产品从来不出货。

It never ships.  Can you iterate your way there? Can you just start from scratch with an MVP  and build it back up? Those are much more likely to actually get you somewhere,  but they're also harder to do and requires a little bit more discipline.

它从不出海。你能迭代到那里吗？你能用一个MVP从头开始，然后再把它建起来吗？这些更有可能让你找到某个地方，但它们也很难做到，并且需要更多的纪律。

Emmett Shear: We've also went through a bunch of redesigns, like big redesigns where you have to  rebuild the whole product. They've been mixed, actually. We've had some that were super successful.  Twitch did a big redesign of our mobile app, maybe three years ago, from the  first version that had basically been a cloned version of the Justin.tv app to a  completely new version.

埃米特·谢尔：我们也经历了一系列的重新设计，比如大的重新设计，在那里你必须重建整个产品。实际上他们是混在一起的。我们有一些非常成功的。特维奇在三年前对我们的移动应用进行了一次大的重新设计，从最初的一个基本上是Justin.tv应用程序的克隆版本到一个全新的版本。

It's basically the version you can use today. That increased engagement by  like 35, 40% per customer when we launched it.

这基本上是你今天可以使用的版本。这使我们推出时，每位客户的参与度增加了大约35%，40%。

It's huge. Changes that make that  big of an impact are actually really rare.

它很大。造成如此大的影响的变化实际上是非常罕见的。

Steve Huffman: Usually data errors.

SteveHuffman：通常是数据错误。

Emmett Shear: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're usually data errors, and in this case, it wasn't. This case,  it actually was a huge increase in usage. Absolutely, redesigns can make a big difference.  We didn't do that redesign because we'd discovered, oh, we couldn't move forward on our  existing product. We got some insight as to what thing should be presented on the  top of a nav, and we redid the navigation to present those things at the  top level instead of burying them three clicks deep. Three touches deep, I should say.  Most of the time, when I see people doing a big redesign, it's because they've  fallen into this trap that engineers and product managers often fall into, which is, "Oh,  we have to fix these eight things. Let's just fix them all at once; it'll  be easier." That's wrong. You should just fix them each one at a time, individually.  If you have eight things that are wrong with your product, that's awesome. You have  this huge, great list of things ... Just fix them one at a time. Fix  everything one at a time. Crank them out quickly. You'll get there way faster one  change at a time than you will in a big rewrite. A big rewrite for  a really early-stage startup is almost equivalent to pivoting a company, and I generally advise  against it.

埃米特·谢尔：是的。嗯是的，通常是数据错误，而在这种情况下，事实并非如此。在这种情况下，它的使用实际上是一个巨大的增长。当然，重新设计会有很大的不同。我们没有重新设计，因为我们发现，哦，我们无法在现有产品上取得进展。我们得到了一些洞察力，什么东西应该出现在导航的顶部，我们重新进行导航，将这些东西呈现在顶层，而不是把它们埋在三下深的地方。我应该说，三次接触很深。大多数时候，当我看到人们进行重大的重新设计时，是因为他们掉进了这个陷阱，工程师和产品经理经常会陷入这样的陷阱，那就是，“哦，我们必须解决这八件事。让我们一次把它们都修好，这样就容易了。”这是不对的。你应该把它们一次地单独解决。如果你的产品有八样东西出了问题，那就太棒了。你有一大串非常好的东西.。一次只修一个。一次只修一件事。快点把他们弄出来。你一次只做一次改变，要比在一次大重写中要快得多。对一家真正早期的初创企业进行大规模重写，几乎相当于让一家公司转向，而我通常建议你不要这样做。

Steve Huffman: It's this weird sort of programmer product procrastination.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：这是一种奇怪的程序员产品拖延。

If don't know what to do, therefore  I'm going to invent this big project to work on. We don't need to use  that library, I'm going to build it myself. Very common. Use the damn library. Yeah.
Michael Seibel: I'd like to talk a little bit about decision making. Maybe after you talk to  your users but before you decide what to build, usually there has to be some  type of consensus-building process, either functional or dysfunctional, between the co-founders. What are some tips  or tricks around how to come to a consensus? Then, maybe more importantly, how do  you deal with the contrarian? How do you deal with having to make a decision  where you know there's going to be a disagreement?

如果不知道该怎么做，所以我要发明这个大项目。我们不需要用那个图书馆，我要自己建。很普通。去他妈的图书馆。嗯迈克尔·塞贝尔：我想谈一谈决策问题。也许在你和你的用户交谈之后，但在你决定建立什么之前，通常在联合创始人之间必须有某种形式的建立共识的过程，要么是功能正常的，要么是功能失调的。关于如何达成共识，有哪些小窍门或诀窍？那么，也许更重要的是，你是如何处理逆向交易的呢？在你知道会有分歧的情况下，你该如何处理做出决定的问题呢？

Emmett Shear: Well, I think the first thing you said is actually super important.

埃米特·谢尔：嗯，我认为你说的第一件事实际上是非常重要的。

It's the thing  I want to reinforce. You talk to your users first, and then you have the  ideas about the product. Almost everyone does it in the opposite order.

这是我想要加强的东西。你先和你的用户交谈，然后你就有了关于这个产品的想法。几乎每个人都是按相反的顺序做的。

It's called product  validation.

这叫做产品验证。

If you find yourself thinking, "I'm going to go talk to my users to  validate my product idea," you've gone horribly off the rails. You do it in the  other order. You don't talk to users to validate your product ideas. You talk to  our users to have your product ideas.

如果你发现自己在想，“我要去和我的用户谈谈来验证我的产品想法”，你已经严重偏离了轨道。你按另一个顺序做。你不会和用户交谈来验证你的产品想法。你与我们的用户交谈，以获得你的产品想法。

I just have a rule, in general, for  people who want to have a voice in product design. They better to talk to  the users and look at the data too.

我只是有一条规则，在一般情况下，对于那些想要在产品设计中有发言权的人来说。他们最好与用户交谈，并查看数据。

If you haven't talked to users and  you haven't looked at data, you don't get to have a opinion about the product.  I'm sorry. The person who's actually done the work gets to have the opinion. You  can have ideas, but they get to make the call. But in the case you  wind up where both people really have talked to the users, and both people really  have looked at the data, and people still disagree as to what we should build  ... Which, by the way, is actually much more rare. Once both people have actually  talked to users and actually looked at the data, it's usually relatively easy to get  to consensus. But it will come up where people still disagree.

如果您没有与用户交谈，也没有查看过数据，那么您就没有机会对该产品发表意见。对不起真正做过这项工作的人会有自己的意见。你可以有主意，但他们可以打电话。但是如果你的结果是两个人都真的和用户交谈过，而且两个人都看过数据，人们对于我们应该建立什么仍然有分歧。顺便说一句，这实际上是非常罕见的。一旦两个人都与用户进行了实际交谈，并实际查看了数据，通常很容易达成共识。但在人们仍然不同意的情况下，就会出现这种情况。

I've found it's better  when you just have someone who's in charge. At the end of the day, you  have someone who's the CEO and everyone agrees this person's judgment will be trusted, and  you let them make the call. You know? Don't avoid conflict. Talk about it, argue  about it, but then, you have someone who just gets to make the call, because  anything else leads to ... Just decision-making that's far too slow for a startup.

我发现如果你有个负责人就更好了。到头来，你有一个人是首席执行官，每个人都同意这个人的判断是可信的，你让他们打电话。你知道不要避免冲突。谈论它，争论它，但是，你有一个人可以打电话，因为其他任何事情都会导致.对创业公司来说，做决定太慢了。

Steve Huffman: Yeah. Maybe it's because I'm usually the one in charge, I just feel like I  don't have a lot of disagreements. There are ...

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：是的。也许是因为我通常是负责人，我只是觉得我没有太多的分歧。有.。

Emmett Shear: Meet the CEO.

埃米特·谢尔：见见首席执行官。

Steve Huffman: Yeah. Largely, I find the situation I'm in, I say one of two things a  lot, which is, "I don't want to argue about it if we can just test  it." And, "I'm very willing to be surprised on this.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：是的。在很大程度上，我发现我所处的处境，我经常说两件事之一，那就是，“如果我们能测试它，我不想争论它。”“我很乐意对此感到惊讶。

I'm probably right, but this  isn't getting into my top three important things to worry about today, so let's just  see." It's easy to do that when you have more resources to "let's just see."  But I think, like Alexis and I over the years, and Adam and I over  the years at Hipmunk ...

我可能是对的，但这并不是我今天最担心的三件事，所以让我们看看。“如果你有更多的资源”让我们看看。“但我想，就像亚历克西斯和我多年来在Hipmunk的日子里，亚当和我.

I think as Emmett pointed out, we very rarely had  these philosophical differences over the product. Sometimes it was timing, like should we build this  thing now? What's the prioritization of these things? But we always agreed on general mechanics  of what we were doing and why we were doing it. The strategy might change,  but the actual ... The details were very rarely not emotional.

我认为，正如埃米特所指出的，我们很少在产品问题上有这些哲学上的分歧。有时候是时间问题，比如我们现在应该建造这个东西吗？这些事情的轻重缓急是什么？但是我们总是在我们正在做的事情以及我们为什么要这样做的一般机制上达成一致。战略可能会改变，但实际上.细节很少是不情绪化的。

If those are getting  emotional, I think there's probably something else structurally wrong. You might be swimming upstream. That  happens a lot. You know, the arguments I've gotten in at Reddit over the last  year, like when we tried to promote ... We do cross-promotion from mobile web to  the app.

如果这些都是情绪化的话，我认为可能还有其他一些结构上的错误。你可能在上游游泳。这种事经常发生。你知道，在过去一年里我在Reddit遇到的争论，比如我们试图宣传.我们做交叉推广从移动网络到应用程序。

It just doesn't feel great.

只是感觉不太好。

It works.

它起作用了

It works and we like the  numbers going up, but it's not really with the user's best intention in mind all  the time. Sometimes it drifts into the "it's good for the company, but maybe not  for the users." When you're in those situations, that's usually when the disagreements come out.  You're not really arguing about the feature anymore, you're arguing about short-term or long-term, or  best for the business or best for the users. When you beat at it, and  beat at it, and beat at it, eventually, you come to a solution that actually  feels right, and it meets your intuition, and you don't feel like you're fighting the  technology, you're not fighting the users anymore, those are usually situations I look out for.
Michael Seibel: I want to get to you guys telling product story, but I want to cover  one topic first, which is that ... Let's take people past launch where now you  need to have some type of process around talking to users, looking at data, making  a decision, building a product, releasing a product, checking your success, and repeating product development  cycle ... What are some advice you can give to early-stage startups around how to  set that up, what that cadence should be, maybe some pitfalls to avoid?

它工作，我们喜欢数字上升，但这并不是真正与用户的最佳意图在任何时候。有时它会变成“这对公司有好处，但对用户没有好处”。当你处于这种情况下时，通常会出现分歧。你不再为这个特性争论了，你在争论短期还是长期，或者是对企业最好，或者是对用户最好。当你打败它，最后，你找到了一个真正正确的解决方案，它符合你的直觉，你不觉得你在对抗技术，你不再和用户对抗，这些通常是我要注意的情况。迈克尔·塞贝尔：我想让你们讲述产品故事，但我想先讲一个话题，那就是.让我们以人们过去的发布为例，现在您需要与用户交流、查看数据、做出决定、构建产品、发布产品、检查您的成功并重复产品开发周期。对于早期创业公司，你能给他们提供什么建议，比如如何设置，节奏应该是什么，或者是一些需要避免的陷阱？

Steve Huffman: The first, just to take one little step back, is ...

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：第一步，只是后退一小步，就是.

I see a lot  of startups get too emotionally high when the numbers are going up, and they're not  investing in this sort of process, because growth masks all problems. At some point, that  kind of stops and you don't have any of these mannerisms.

我看到很多初创公司在数字上升的时候情绪太高，他们没有在这种过程中投资，因为成长掩盖了所有的问题。在某种程度上，这种停止，你没有任何这样的习惯。

I also see startups  get a little too low when things aren't going right at first, and they kind  of psyche themselves out. You want to live in that in-between.

我也看到创业公司在一开始就会变得有些不太好，而且他们自己也会变得有些心烦意乱。你想住在中间。

If the data's really  good, well, check the data.

如果数据真的很好，那就查查数据。

If the data's really bad, check the data. Okay. Then,  in terms of the actual process, first of all, it's going to be different at  every company, and it's going to change as you scale.

如果数据非常糟糕，检查数据。好的。然后，就实际流程而言，首先，每个公司都会有不同的情况，而且随着规模的扩大，情况也会发生变化。

I think it's just most  important to have a way of working, to have ...

我认为最重要的是有一种工作方式，有.

If you just want to  start out really, really specific of ... The way I like to think about it  is where do we want to be in a year? Okay? Let's draw a straight  line from that to here. What do we need to be doing today to get  there in a year? That's how I like our hypothesis. We need to validate anything  about that, probably a few things here or there, do that. Does it check out?  Yes. And then it's just straight line.

如果你只是想开始非常具体的.。我喜欢这样想，那就是一年中我们想要去哪里？好吧让我们画一条直线从那里到这里。我们今天需要做些什么才能在一年内到达那里？这就是我喜欢我们的假设。我们需要验证有关这方面的任何东西，可能这里或那里的一些事情，去做这件事。退房了吗？是然后就是直线。

I like to work on two-week cycles. Check  in every week on basically that kind of thing, like, where do we want to  be in a year? Are we still on track? Are we still doing the right  thing? Does it still make sense? Are our assumptions still holding to be true? If  not, pop it up a stack. Then you give people whatever it is ...

我喜欢两周的工作周期。基本上每周都有这样的事情，比如，一年中我们想去哪里？我们还在轨道上吗？我们还在做正确的事吗？这还有意义吗？我们的假设是否仍然成立？如果不是，弹出一个堆栈。那你就给别人任何东西.。

If  you're early startup, you give them 13 days to work.

如果你起步早，你给他们13天的时间去工作。

If you're a more mature  startup, you give them nine days to work, and then keep going after that.

如果你是一个更成熟的创业公司，你给他们九天的时间去工作，然后继续工作。

I  found that that's really worked really well for me.

我发现这对我真的很管用。

Emmett Shear: One thing I found, actually, is that your goal of talking to users shouldn't be  course corrections on a week-to-week basis.

埃米特·谢尔：事实上，我发现的一件事是，你和用户交谈的目标不应该是每周一周的课程修正。

I did a whole crap ton of talking to  users at the very start of Twitch, trying to figure out what the users wanted,  how to think about them. We didn't, because we had other reasons to talk to  users, but we could've gone six months without talking to user because we actually ...  We knew what users wanted. They wanted to make money on the service. Streamers wanted  to make money, they wanted to reach more viewers, and they wanted positive social feedback  for what they were doing. You kind of just check anything you were doing, is  this going to deliver this to our streamers? Yes or no? If so, how much?  Great. You don't have to talk to anybody. You already know what they want. And  you need to go back and revisit it and sort of talk to users periodically,  because you need to understand more of the nuances of are the things about your  service that are bugging them, is someone else doing something really cool? The goal of  talking to users is not to get them to tell you what features to build,  because users are really bad at that. They actually have no idea what features to  build. The goal of talking to users is to get to understand them really well,  and users don't change that fast.

一开始我就和用户进行了一堆废话的交谈，试图弄清楚用户想要什么，如何思考他们。我们没有，因为我们有其他的理由和用户交谈，但是我们可以花六个月的时间不和用户交谈，因为我们实际上.我们知道用户想要什么。他们想通过这项服务赚钱。他们想要赚钱，他们想要接触更多的观众，他们想要对他们所做的事情给予积极的社会反馈。你只是检查一下你在做什么，这会把这个送到我们的彩带上吗？是还是不？如果是，多少钱？太棒了你不需要和任何人说话。你已经知道他们想要什么了。你需要回到过去，定期和用户交谈，因为你需要了解更多的细微差别，你的服务是否让他们感到烦恼，其他人在做什么真的很酷吗？与用户交谈的目的不是让他们告诉您要构建哪些功能，因为用户在这方面做得很差。他们实际上不知道要构建什么特性。与用户交谈的目的是很好地理解他们，而且用户不会改变得那么快。

I personally prefer more in-depth time with my customers,  talking to them for a while. Then, depending on the size of the thing we  need to do or trying to move, we might go just work and build and  look at metrics for the next six months and not actually talk to users that  much for a while. Because if you know that what people want is to make  more money, you can spend six months optimizing the sell through rate on an object  or on how much advertising you have, and you just can have faith that it's  going to be good and you will be rewarded.

我个人更喜欢和我的客户进行更深入的交流，与他们交谈一段时间.然后，取决于我们需要做或试图移动的事情的大小，我们可能只需要工作、构建并查看未来六个月的度量标准，并且在一段时间内不与用户进行过多的交谈。因为如果你知道人们想要的是赚更多的钱，你可以花六个月的时间来优化一个目标的卖出率，或者你有多少广告，你就可以相信它会是好的，你会得到回报的。

Steve Huffman: I think the classic advice that's very difficult to follow is you need to have  courage of your convictions. You decide what you're going to build.

史蒂夫赫夫曼：我认为经典的建议，很难遵循的是，你需要有勇气，你的信念。你决定你要建什么。

It might six months  to build it, and at Reddit, we just kind of do it in front of  everybody and get flamed by our users the whole time, which is fine.

构建它可能需要六个月，而在Reddit，我们只是在每个人面前这样做，并且一直被我们的用户点燃，这是很好的。

I'm used  to it, but I have to kind of tell our product people, just keep pushing.  Keep pushing. Just ship a little bit every week, and then at six months, they'll  get it. At the same time, the completely contradictory advice is you have to know  when you're wrong. You have to be able to identify when you're wrong. You have  to be able to say, "All of you people are wrong, and I'm right," and  at some point, you have to decide, "Oh, wait. No, you're right." If you can  walk that line, you need to have this good combination of high ego and high  humility and balance those. But I always try to just run this process in my  head, "Wait, am I wrong? Nope, they're still wrong."

我已经习惯了，但我得告诉我们的产品人员，继续努力。继续推。每周发一点货，六个月后，他们就能拿到了。同时，完全矛盾的建议是，你必须知道什么时候你错了。你必须能够辨别出你错了什么时候。你必须能够说，“你们所有人都错了，我是对的，”在某个时候，你必须决定，“哦，等等。不，你是对的。”如果你能走这条线，你需要有高自我和高度谦逊的良好结合，并平衡这些。但是我总是试图在我的脑海里运行这个过程，“等等，我错了吗？不，他们还是错了。”

Emmett Shear: You don't have to talk to your users every week.

埃米特·谢尔：你不必每周都和你的用户交谈。

It's totally unnecessary. You do  need to look at your numbers every week. You don't even need to look at  them every day.

完全没有必要。你每周都要看你的数字。你甚至不需要每天看他们。

It's actually pointless and almost just ego gratification to look at your  numbers every day, but you should look at your numbers every single week. You should  confront, are they up or down, and ask yourself why. The holy grail of product  design is for your numbers to move, and for you to truly understand why they  moved. We still struggle with that. There have been points where I felt like I  understood it, and then it slips away again as the business gets more complicated. But  you're always trying to be able to explain, fully, down to atomic ground truth ...  We are up 20% this week because we got this many more new devices and  our retention rate is this on those devices, and this is the conversion rates, and  if you do the math and you can explain it all the way down to  this new feature moved this conversion rate on this page by this amount, and therefore,  we are up.

每天看你的数字是毫无意义的，几乎只是自我满足，但你应该每周看一次你的数字。你应该面对，他们是向上还是向下，并问自己为什么。产品设计的圣杯是让你的数字移动，并让你真正理解它们移动的原因。我们还在努力解决这个问题。有些时候，我觉得自己理解了它，但随着业务变得更加复杂，它又一次溜走了。但你总是想要完全解释原子地面的真相.本周我们上涨了20%，因为我们得到了更多的新设备，而我们的保留率就是这些设备上的这个，这就是转换率，如果你做了计算，你可以解释到这个新特性将这个转换率在这个页面上移动了这么多，因此，我们上升了。

If you can really do that, it's super powerful.

如果你真的能做到的话，它是超级强大的。

It's also really  hard, but you'll never get there if you don't build the intuition or just looking  at it every week.
Michael Seibel: In the last five minutes before we open for questions, can you guys walk through  a feature that is visible on your sites now? I'll let you choose, that's either  bad or good, and talk about the process of how it came to be.

这也真的很难，但如果你不建立直觉，或者每周只看一看，你就永远到不了那里。迈克尔-塞贝尔：在我们回答问题之前的五分钟里，你们能在你们的网站上浏览一个可以看到的功能吗？我让你选择，这要么是坏的，要么是好的，并讨论它是如何发展的过程。

Steve Huffman: I have a lot.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：我有很多。

I'll talk about one of my favorite ones. This is from  the early days of Reddit. The early days of Reddit was just links. Everything was  external. Eventually, we added comments, probably about six months in. The first comment was, "This  is the end of Reddit." That would be the first comment on every product we've  ever released. Users started doing this curious thing where they would ... On any post,  you could click on the link or you could click on the comments page to  go to the comments for that page. Our IDs for posts are just a ;  it's in the URL. Users would submit the URL that would represent the comment page  for the URL they're submitting. They would just take the newest post and increment by  one and submit that URL, so that you had a post that would link to  its own comments page.

我来谈谈我最喜欢的一个。这是Reddit早期的作品。Reddit的早期只是链接。一切都是外在的。最后，我们增加了评论，大概六个月后。第一个评论是，“这是Reddit的终结。”这将是我们发布的每一个产品的第一个评论。用户开始做一件奇怪的事情.在任何帖子上，您都可以单击该链接，也可以单击“备注”页面以转到该页面的注释。我们的帖子ID只是一个；它在URL中。用户将提交表示他们提交的URL的注释页面的URL。他们只需获得最新的帖子和增量一，并提交该URL，以便您有一个帖子，将链接到它自己的评论页面。

It was really cool, so we called those self-posts. Users were  doing this.

太酷了，所以我们给那些自传打了电话。用户就是这么做的。

I remember watching them doing and thinking this is really cool.

我记得我看着他们做着，觉得这真的很酷。

I would've  never thought to do this. Sometimes they'd guess wrong. They'd submit a post to somebody  else's comment page, which was funny, and so ... Because our user base at the  time was fairly technical, the way we made this work is when you're submitting a  link, you would just type in the URL area, "self," and it would automatically do  that little circular thing for you. That was the beginning of self-posts on Reddit. Self-posts  are now 60% of our content.

我从没想过要这么做。有时候他们猜错了。他们会在别人的评论页面上发一篇文章，这很有趣，所以.因为当时我们的用户群是相当技术性的，所以当你提交一个链接时，你只需输入URL区域“Self”，它就会自动为你做那个循环的小事情。这是Reddit自传的开始。自传现在占我们内容的60%.

I don't know, a few million a day. We  would've never built that feature if we hadn't been watching our users.

我不知道，一天几百万。如果我们没有监视我们的用户，我们就不会构建这个功能。

I mean, I'm  explaining it now, but if I explain that feature without it existing, I don't know  if it would make a ton of sense. Users, most of them didn't get it  at first, either. There were just like, "Comments are destroying this site," and, "There's not  even a link here.

我是说，我现在解释它，但是如果我解释没有它存在的特性，我不知道它是否有意义。用户，他们中的大多数人一开始也没有得到它。就像“评论正在破坏这个网站”和“这里连一个链接都没有”。

It's just comments." It just kind of goes to show, I  think, the best product ideas are the ones where your users are doing it anyway,  and you just grease it a little bit. That's when I talk about before where  you're either swimming upstream, or just everything just feels right. That was a classic example  of it just felt right, and it completely changed the site.

这只是一些评论而已。“我认为，最好的产品创意就是让你的用户做得更好，而你只是稍微给它涂点油。那是我之前说过的，你要么游向上游，要么一切都感觉很好。这是一个经典的例子，它让你感觉很对，而且它彻底改变了网站。”

Emmett Shear: I think my favorite story here is an advertising product, actually, which is funny. All  of our users told us really, really clearly, "We want to show advertising and make  money off of our streams." That was a clear desire. Everybody wanted it. They also  told us their least favorite thing about our competitors' products was that they would show  these ads over the stream, and it would be disruptive to their users' experience, and  they hated it.

埃米特·谢尔：我觉得我最喜欢的故事其实是一个广告产品，这很有趣。我们所有的用户都非常清楚地告诉我们：“我们想要展示广告，并从我们的溪流中赚钱。”这是一个明确的愿望。每个人都想要。他们还告诉我们，他们对竞争对手产品最不喜欢的地方是，他们会在流媒体上播放这些广告，这会破坏他们的用户体验，他们讨厌这种做法。

It was very interesting, getting these two pieces of feedback, because they  both really wanted us to put ads. Sometimes different people, sometimes, actually, literally the same  people. Their biggest complaint about the opposing service was, "Competitor's service is annoying my viewers  with all these ads," and this is a hard nut to crack because you kind  of need to solve for both. You're not allowed to just give up as a  product manager and pick one.

这很有趣，得到了这两条反馈，因为他们都想让我们投放广告。有时候不同的人，有时候，实际上，是同一个人。他们对方服务最大的抱怨是，“竞争对手的服务让我的观众讨厌这些广告”，这是一个很难解决的问题，因为你需要解决这两个问题。你不能就这么放弃作为一个产品经理而选择一个。

I'm really proud of our solution, which was we gave  them a button. We inverted it, and we gave the streamer the ability to hit  a button to run ads on their own channel.

我为我们的解决方案感到骄傲，我们给了他们一个按钮。我们倒置它，我们让彩带能够按下按钮在自己的频道上播放广告。

It's funny, because normally, you'd think  of that as something that will ...

很有趣，因为通常情况下，你会认为.

If you're uploading content to Facebook, you would  never press a button on that to show more ads to your friends, but because  we were cutting them in on the revenue, they were actually heavily incentivized to hit  this button. We basically got this paid workforce of people placing advertising in the downtime  of the stream.

如果你把内容上传到Facebook上，你永远不会按下按钮来显示更多的广告给你的朋友，但是因为我们在削减他们的收入，他们实际上受到了很大的激励去点击这个按钮。我们基本上得到了一批付费员工，他们在溪流的停工时间投放广告。

I'm really proud of that clever solution.

我真的为这个聪明的解决方案感到骄傲。

I think it points at  something that I think is a really important principle of product design in general, which  is that you want to just try inverting all of your assumptions. We got stuck  on that advertising problem for a long time because we didn't want to make it  disruptive to the customer experience, and we couldn't figure out how to automate putting it  on the stream in a good way. At the same time, we really wanted to  show ads on the video stream. We had this implicitous assumption in our heads that  we had to figure out where to put the ad, and once we gave that  assumption up, it was much more clear what to do going forward. That's one of  those, I don't know, I'm just really proud of that product decision because it was  one of the things that made our broadcasters super happy and no one ... You  can't complain. You hit the button.
Michael Seibel: How many times is that button clicked every day now?

我认为它指向了一些东西，我认为这是产品总体设计的一个非常重要的原则，那就是你只想把你所有的假设都颠倒过来。我们在这个广告问题上被困了很长时间，因为我们不想让它破坏客户的体验，而且我们也想不出如何用一种好的方式自动地把它放到流中。同时，我们真的很想在视频流上播放广告。我们脑子里有这样一个含蓄的假设，那就是我们必须弄清楚在哪里放广告，一旦我们放弃了这个假设，我们就更加清楚了下一步该做什么。这就是其中之一，我不知道，我真的为那个产品决定感到骄傲，因为这是让我们的播音员非常高兴的事情之一，而且没有人.你不能抱怨。你按了按钮。迈克尔·塞贝尔：这个按钮现在每天被点击多少次？

Emmett Shear: That's a really good question.

埃米特·谢尔：这是个很好的问题。

I don't know the numbers offhand. A lot.

我不知道手边的数字。很多。

It's clicked  very often. People really like that button because it's a "click the button, make $15  button." But they're also aware of the trade-off, which is that their viewers don't like  it when they hit the button too much. By putting that in their court, they  get to make the optimal trade-off for their stream in their situation.
Michael Seibel: All right. Those are my questions.

它经常被点击。人们非常喜欢这个按钮，因为它是一个“点击按钮，制造15美元的按钮”。但他们也意识到了这种权衡，那就是他们的观众不喜欢太按钮。通过在他们的法庭上这样做，他们可以为他们所处的处境做出最佳的权衡。迈克尔·塞贝尔：好的。这些是我的问题。

I want to open it up to you guys,  happy to talk about product, happy to talk about YC stuff, whatever you'd like to  chat about. Go ahead.
Speaker 4: What about the process of discovering you had product/market fit, getting past that launch ,  and then discovering there's something sustainable beyond this for users that are really committed to  this?
Michael Seibel: Just to repeat the question, how did you know when you had product/market fit?

我想向你们敞开心扉，乐于谈论产品，乐于谈论YC的东西，不管你们想聊什么。您先请演讲者4：对于那些真正致力于产品/市场的用户来说，如何发现自己的产品/市场适合，通过发布，然后发现除了这个之外还有可持续的东西呢？Michael Seibel：重复这个问题，你怎么知道什么时候产品/市场合适？

Steve Huffman: At Reddit, this is the nice scenario. We were growing despite not knowing anything about  our business, knowing little about our users, not really knowing how to run a business,  not having a ton of product sense, being down a lot. We were growing. That's  the nice scenario. That's a good one. At Hipmunk, our natural state was zero users.  I'm not sure we ever got product/market fit. The users who came to Hipmunk liked  it, but we had to fight for every single one of them.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：在Reddit，这是一个很好的场景。尽管我们对我们的业务一无所知，对用户知之甚少，不知道如何经营企业，也不具备大量的产品意识，但我们仍然在增长。我们在成长。这是个很好的场景。这是个好主意。在Hipmunk，我们的自然状态是零用户。我不确定我们是否有合适的产品/市场。来到Hipmunk的用户喜欢它，但我们必须为他们中的每一个人而战。

It's possible to  do that, but we were ... Again, I think that entire company, we were swimming  upstream.

这是有可能的，但我们.再说一次，我想整个公司，我们都在向上游。

I remember the day we kind of realized that. We ran this survey of  why do you use Hipmunk, and we put a lot of effort into the product.  We thought it was a really good product. Legitimately, you could find a flight a  lot faster on us than our competitors. 35% of people said it's because of the  logo, and 50% of the people said because we had lower prices, which we didn't.  We made it. The company ran for five years and ended up selling just fine.  I think we were really fighting that one.
Michael Seibel: I think this is a huge misconception, by the way. Most of the companies that  apply to YC don't have product/market fit. Most of the companies on Demo Day don't  have product/market fit. Most companies die before product/market fit. A lot of people talk about  product/market fit as this organic step in the process. Oh, you raise angel and then  you get an office, and you hire some people, and you have product/market fit. You  would be surprised at how few companies ... Product/market fit is typically described as "you  are overwhelmed with demand for your product."

我记得有一天我们意识到。我们对你为什么使用Hipmunk进行了调查，我们在产品上投入了大量的精力。我们认为这是一个非常好的产品。合理地说，你可以比我们的竞争对手更快地找到我们的航班。35%的人说这是因为商标，50%的人说是因为我们有更低的价格，而我们没有。我们成功了。这家公司经营了五年，结果卖得很好。我觉得我们真的在和那个人做斗争。迈克尔·塞贝尔：顺便说一句，我认为这是一个巨大的误解。大多数申请YC的公司没有适合的产品/市场。大多数在演示日的公司都没有适合的产品/市场。大多数公司在产品/市场适合之前就死了。许多人谈论产品/市场适合作为这一过程中的有机步骤。哦，你培养天使，然后你得到一个办公室，你雇用一些人，你有产品/市场适合。你会惊讶于这么少的公司.。产品/市场匹配通常被描述为“您对产品的需求不堪重负”。

Emmett Shear: Yeah.

埃米特·谢尔：是的。

It's really obvious when you've hit product/market hit. Your product is bad. You can  point at seven things that are broken about it, and you have all these features  you know you need to build, and weirdly, it's growing really fast anyways.

当你受到产品/市场的冲击时，这是很明显的。你的产品不好。你可以指出它的七个坏地方，你知道你需要构建所有这些特性，而且奇怪的是，它正在以非常快的速度增长。

It's really  obvious when you're product/market fit. Your product is growing like crazy, and you are spending  ... You don't get to fix any of the things that are broken or bad  about your product because you're spending all of your time fixing it as it scales.  The metaphor I use for startups is to this kind of Sisyphean, you're pushing this  boulder up a hill, and you're pushing the boulder, and you're pushing the boulder, and  you're pushing the boulder ... Product/markets fit is when you crest the hill. Your job  doesn't get easier, but it does change a lot, because now you're chasing the boulder  as it tries to roll away from you down the hill on the other side.  Now you're sprinting, flat out, trying to catch up, which is hard in its own  way, but it feels totally different. Because whereas before, you have this, "Oh, god, we're  like ..." Every inch is like ... As Steve was describing with Hipmunk, every inch  is like you're pushing this boulder and you're fighting for every inch. Now it's like,  "Oh, crap.

当你适合产品/市场时，这是很明显的。你的产品长得像个疯子，你在花钱.你不能修复你的产品的任何坏或坏的东西，因为你花了你所有的时间去修理它。我对创业公司的比喻是这样的，你把这块巨石推上山，你推着巨石.产品/市场适合当你达到顶峰时。你的工作并没有变得容易，但它确实改变了很多，因为现在你在追逐巨石，因为它试图从另一边的山坡上滚下来。现在你在冲刺，努力追赶，这是很难用自己的方式，但感觉完全不同。因为以前，你会说，“哦，天哪，我们就像.”每一寸都像是.。正如史蒂夫在希普蒙德所描述的，每一寸都像是你在推着这块巨石，你在为每一寸而战。现在就像，“哦，糟了。

If we don't keep up with this, it's going to run away from  us." That's a totally different feeling. You'll know.

如果我们不跟上这一点，它就会逃离我们。“这是一种完全不同的感觉，你会知道的。

Steve Huffman: Here's the problem. Eventually, you'll catch the boulder on the way down, and then you're  like, "Shit.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：问题就在这里。最终，你会在下坡的时候抓住巨石，然后你就会说，“妈的。

I'm actually pushing it uphill again."

我实际上又把它推上山了。“

Emmett Shear: Yep. Oh, absolutely. That's just what happens.

埃米特·谢尔：是的。哦，当然。结果就是这样。

It's like asking, "How do you know if  you're in love?" Trust me, you know.

就像问，“你怎么知道你是不是恋爱了？”相信我，你知道的。

Steve Huffman: Yeah.
Michael Seibel: It's funny, is one of the major problems that YC companies have is how do  they stay small and lean and don't spend a lot of money, don't have a  lot of management overhead, don't have a lot of bills until they reach product/market fit.  One of the typical mistakes is confusing an angel round or a couple million dollars  in the bank for product/market fit.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：是的。迈克尔·塞贝尔：有趣的是，YC公司面临的主要问题之一是，他们如何保持小而瘦，不花很多钱，没有太多的管理费用，在达到产品/市场适合之前没有很多账单。典型的错误之一是混淆了天使圈或银行里的几百万美元来适应产品/市场。

It's extremely common. All right, other questions?
Speaker 5: How do you recognize your first group of user? Yeah.
Michael Seibel: How do you recognize your first groups of users?

这是非常普遍的。好吧，还有其他问题吗？演讲者5：你如何识别你的第一组用户？嗯MichaelSeibel：你是如何识别你的第一批用户的？

Steve Huffman: Reddit was easy. They were just like Alexis and I. Emmett was talking about the  intuition phase of building products. We were in that for a long time. Our users,  they read the same Paul Graham blog that we did. They were programmers like I  was, so it was really, really easy. Hipmunk, we were actually completely wrong about who  our users were.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：Reddit很容易。他们就像Alexis和I.Emmett说的是制造产品的直觉阶段。我们在那里待了很长时间。我们的用户，他们读的保罗格雷厄姆博客和我们一样。他们和我一样是程序员，所以非常容易。Hipmunk，我们实际上完全错了我们的用户是谁。

I don't know if we ever quite solved this problem. They solved  it through , which is we built a product for ourselves, like tech-savvy people who  travel a fair amount and can their own travel. But in reality, the only way  to make money in travels is sell to business travelers because they're the only one  who travels multiple times a year. Business travelers don't get to use things like Hipmunk  or Kayak, right? They use American Express and Concur.

我不知道我们是否解决过这个问题。他们解决了这个问题，这就是我们为自己制造了一种产品，就像高科技的人一样，他们的旅行量很大，而且可以自己旅行。但实际上，在旅行中赚钱的唯一途径是卖给商务旅行者，因为他们是唯一一年多次旅行的人。商务旅行者不会使用像Hipmunk或Kayak这样的东西，对吗？他们使用美国运通卡和康库尔。

It took us, actually, a couple  years to synthesize that. We were just like, "Fuck."

实际上，我们花了几年时间才合成了这个。我们就像，“操。”

Emmett Shear: I think there's two kinds of startups. There are startups that are building things for  themselves, and where your customer's easy to identify.

埃米特·谢尔：我认为有两种类型的初创公司。有一些创业公司正在为自己打造东西，在那里你的客户很容易被识别。

It's you and people like you. And  there's startups building things for a third party of users, where you should arrive at  which customers are your customers through an analytic mode, through thinking about the problem. Twitch  was an analytic startup because I was a huge fan of watching game streaming, but  actually, I wasn't much of a streamer.

是你和像你这样的人。还有一些初创公司在为第三方用户建立东西，在那里你应该通过一个分析模式，通过对问题的思考，达到客户是你的客户的目的。特维奇是一家分析型初创公司，因为我是观看游戏流的超级粉丝，但实际上，我并不是一个喜欢看游戏流的人。

I've never been much of a streamer, and  I basically dug in on Justin.tv and realized that 80% of the minutes watched were  coming from our top 200 streamers.

我从来都不是一个流线型的人，我在Justin.tv上钻研了一下，并意识到80%的观看时间都来自我们的前200条彩带。

I was like, "Oh, they're the most important people.  If we lose them, we lose everything.

我说，“哦，他们是最重要的人。如果我们失去了他们，我们就会失去一切。

If we can get 200 more of them,  we'll be twice as big." It was sort of identified analytically that that was the  right group of users and those are the right customers.

如果我们能再多得到200个用户，我们的规模将是原来的两倍。“从分析的角度来看，这是正确的用户群体，也是正确的客户群体。

I think that you should  just know which one you are, and the most important thing there is that if  it's not for you and you're not legitimately building something for you and for you  to use, and you aren't a big group of people ...

我认为你应该知道你是哪一个，最重要的是，如果不是为你自己，你没有合法地为你和你建立某种东西供你使用，而你也不是一大群人。

In this case, you  should absolutely use the analytic mode, and ...

在这种情况下，你应该绝对使用分析模式，而且.

I don't know, it's different for every  single company.

我不知道，每个公司都不一样。

Steve Huffman: Yeah.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：是的。

Emmett Shear: But think hard about it.

埃米特·谢尔：但是仔细想想吧。

I don't know.

我不知道

Steve Huffman: Yeah. But if it's not for you, your intuition is lying to you.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：是的。但如果不是你，你的直觉就是在骗你。

Emmett Shear: Yeah. Yes.

埃米特·谢尔：是的。是

Steve Huffman: Every time.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：每次。

Emmett Shear: Yes.

埃米特·谢尔：是的。

Steve Huffman: And you have to supplement it with data.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：你必须用数据来补充它。

Emmett Shear: Yeah.

埃米特·谢尔：是的。

Steve Huffman: Or talking to your users, or whatever.
Michael Seibel: Shockingly, we're 100% on time.

史蒂夫·赫夫曼：或者和你的用户交谈，或者什么的。迈克尔·塞贝尔：令人震惊的是，我们100%准时。

If everyone can thank these guys for coming out today,  appreciate it.


如果每个人都能感谢这些人今天的到来，谢谢你们。
