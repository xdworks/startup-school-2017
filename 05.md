# How to Build a Product II

#如何构建产品II

Aaron Levie: How's everybody doing? Is everybody really pumped up to talk about enterprise software? Good. That's  what you want to do today.

大家都好吗？每个人真的很兴奋地谈论企业软件吗？好的这就是你今天想做的。

I'm Aaron Levie, CEO, co-founder of Box. What I  wanted to do was share a little bit about our story at Box and how  we started building our company. We actually didn't start as an enterprise software company. We  eventually changed our business model and our path.

我是艾伦·列维，公司首席执行官，也是Box的联合创始人。我想要做的是分享一下我们在Box的故事，以及我们是如何开始建立公司的。实际上，我们并不是从企业软件公司开始的。我们最终改变了我们的商业模式和道路。

I want to talk a little bit  how we got to that decision and how we started building up our product and  our company.

我想谈谈我们是如何做出这一决定的，以及我们是如何开始建立我们的产品和公司的。

I really hope this is true.

我真的希望这是真的。

If many of you go out and  build enterprise software companies, maybe there's some lessons that we've learned that took us a  long time to learn that maybe you can learn a little bit faster because of  some of the things that we've gone through.

如果你们中的许多人走出去建立企业软件公司，也许我们已经学到了一些经验教训，我们花了很长时间才认识到，也许你们可以更快地学习，因为我们经历了一些事情。

I think with some time we can  open up for questions or what not.

我想等一段时间我们就可以回答问题了。

Is that all cool? We good with that?  Okay. This is going to be highly interactive. We got to like talk to each  other. You know what I'm saying? I love it when the least interactive part is  when I call out that we need to be interactive, but okay. Here's how we  have been building for the modern enterprise and maybe some lessons that you can take  with you. We started box in 2005. We were actually sophomores and freshmen in college  at the time when the idea got started. This was about 12 years ago. What  was happening was everywhere that we were working from, everywhere that we were trying to  access files from, everywhere that we were trying to share ... Anybody we were trying  to share data with, it was just way too hard to do this. We had  to have these USB thumb drives. Hopefully you've never had to use one before.

这一切都很酷吗？我们对此很在行吗？好的。这将是高度互动的。我们得喜欢和对方聊天。你知道我在说什么吗？我喜欢在互动最少的时候，我呼吁我们需要互动，但没关系。这是我们如何为现代企业建设，也许你可以从中吸取一些教训。我们在2005年开始使用Box。在这个想法开始的时候，我们实际上是大学二年级和一年级的学生。这是12年前的事了。所发生的一切是我们工作的地方，我们试图从那里访问文件的地方，我们试图分享的所有地方.任何我们试图与之共享数据的人，要做到这一点实在太难了。我们必须有这些USB拇指驱动器。希望你以前从没用过。

If  you have USB thumb drives, you're emailing yourself files. You have FTP accounts and it  was just way too complicated for just getting daily work done. Just way too slow,  too cumbersome. At the time I actually did an internship with a company that also  use enterprise software for sharing and collaborating and managing content. That technology was also way  too complicated and complex. Really we got the idea in kind of late 2004. What  was happening was we saw this confluence of major technology trends that we felt could  go and solve this problem of why is it so hard just to share files  and get work done with other people. We saw that there would be a handful  of major technology trends that could ultimately solve this problem of working with our information,  working with our data from anywhere. The big three though that we focused in on  were the ... The first was mobile ubiquity. Now obviously this is a standard trend.  No software company would start without a mobile strategy. Back in 2004 and 2005 it  wasn't the case, but we had this vision and we had this foresight where we  thought back in 2004 and 2005 that over the next decade the entire planet would  start to be using Blackberry's everywhere. That was our vision. We were wrong fortunately. We  got better devices, but we knew that mobile was certainly going to be a really  powerful opportunity in the future.

如果你有USB拇指驱动器，你就是在给自己发电子邮件。你有FTP帐户，这太复杂了，无法完成日常工作。太慢了太麻烦了。当时，我实际上在一家公司实习，该公司也使用企业软件来共享、协作和管理内容。这项技术也过于复杂和复杂。实际上，我们在2004年末就有了这个想法。正在发生的是，我们看到了主要技术趋势的汇合点，我们认为这些趋势可以解决这个问题，为什么与其他人共享文件和完成工作如此困难。我们看到，会有一些主要的技术趋势最终解决这个问题-处理我们的信息，处理来自任何地方的数据。我们关注的三巨头是.。第一种是可移动的普遍现象。显然，这是一个标准趋势。没有移动战略，任何软件公司都不会起家。早在2004年和2005年，情况就不是这样了，但我们有着这样的愿景和远见，在2004年和2005年，我们曾想过，在接下来的十年里，整个地球都将开始使用黑莓的“无处不在”(Blackberry‘sEverywhere)。这就是我们的愿景。幸运的是我们错了。我们有了更好的设备，但我们知道移动将是一个非常强大的机会在未来。

It was going to change the way people worked with  information. We're glad that it ended up being a little bit of a better platform.  We also saw this trend of the cost of computing and the cost of storage  was dropping pretty rapidly.

它将改变人们处理信息的方式。我们很高兴它最终成为了一个更好的平台。我们也看到了计算成本和存储成本下降的趋势。

It wasn't called cloud computing at the time, but you could  see that there was this ability to buy lots and lots of infrastructure at scale,  centralized it in one place and then be able to build applications on it over  the internet. We sort of figure why is it that people are going out and  building their own infrastructure and their own data center when a software provider could do  this all themselves and get the economies to scale to serve lots and lots of  customers with that technology. We said okay, at some point in time computing is going  to reach this point where it's really, really cheap and inexpensive for anybody and so  that's what should be in the cloud. Then finally, we figured that as more and  more people were connected to the internet, as more and more people in businesses were  working on mobile devices and collaborating more and more that we'd become much more interconnected.  Businesses that once had to have all of their own people and infrastructure and competencies  within their own organization would eventually be able to be networked with partners and clients  and vendors and colleagues all around the world and be able to get value from  everyone which would mean that you'd need software that would be better at letting us  interact with one another over the internet as opposed to just people with our own  corporate network which is where our market had traditionally kind of been focused on. We  took these three big trends, everybody on the internet, everybody on mobile, and really, really  cheap computing and storage. We said what would we design if those conditions were true  in the future? What would be design to build a really, really simple way for  people to share files and securely access their information? We launched this thing.

当时它不是云计算，但你可以看到，它有能力大规模购买大量的基础设施，将其集中在一个地方，然后能够在互联网上构建应用程序。我们可以理解为什么人们会走出去，建立自己的基础设施和数据中心，而软件提供商可以自己做这一切，让经济规模来为大量的客户提供这种技术。我们说，好吧，在某个时候，计算将会达到这样的地步，对任何人来说，它都非常，非常便宜，所以这就是云中应该有的东西。最后，我们发现，随着越来越多的人连接到互联网，越来越多的商业人士在移动设备上工作，越来越多的人合作，我们将变得越来越互联。曾经必须在自己的组织中拥有自己的人员、基础设施和能力的企业最终将能够与世界各地的合作伙伴、客户、供应商和同事建立网络，并能够从每个人那里获得价值，这意味着您将需要更好地让我们通过互联网，而不是只有我们自己的企业网络，这是我们的市场一直关注的人。我们采取了这三大趋势，互联网上的每个人，移动上的每个人，以及非常便宜的计算和存储。我们说过，如果将来这些条件是真的，我们会设计什么？怎样设计才能为人们提供一种非常、非常简单的方式来共享文件和安全地访问他们的信息呢？我们发射了这个东西。

It was  actually called Box.net at the time. We launched the site and the idea was really  simple. You could upload your files and you can access them from any web browser,  any mobile device. Within a few months of launching, thousands of people were signing up  for it. We had worked on some mechanics to make sure that was as simple  as possible, so we had way easier sign up flow.

它当时实际上叫做Box.net。我们推出了这个网站，这个想法非常简单。你可以上传你的文件，你可以从任何网络浏览器，任何移动设备访问它们。在发射后的几个月内，成千上万的人注册了它。我们已经做了一些机械工作，以确保这是尽可能简单的，所以我们有更容易的注册流程。

It was just focused on  the end users.

它只关注最终用户。

In traditional IT environments you usually had to go to corporate IT  or you had to go to corporate security to be able to get access to  technology. We just let anybody sign up with their own information, their own email address  which was actually pretty disruptive at the time to traditional IT. Anybody could go online.  They could get a couple gigabytes of storage space and be able to share and  access their information from anywhere. That was the original idea. What we sort of ultimately  realized that we actually had no clue about it because we were just in college  at the time was that enterprises all around the world and companies of all sizes  were just used to really, really bad technology. The bar was just really, really low  for what you could do to ... Our first application was pretty horrendous, but the  bar was so low that all you had to do was solve some basic problems  and then end users within those IT environments, within those enterprises would all of a  sudden want to adopt your technology. What we discovered was that people all around the  world and companies of all sizes whether it was a Fortune 500 company that was  spending hundreds of millions of dollars on technology or small businesses, everybody had this interest  and demand for really, really simple tools. One of our competitors at the time, the  primary product you had to use for sharing information looked a little something like this.  This is a screen shot from one of the products.

在传统的IT环境中，您通常必须使用企业IT，或者必须使用企业安全才能访问技术。我们只是让任何人注册他们自己的信息，他们自己的电子邮件地址，这实际上是相当破坏性的时候，传统的IT。任何人都可以上网。他们可以获得几千兆字节的存储空间，并且能够在任何地方共享和访问他们的信息。那是最初的想法。我们最终意识到，我们对此一无所知，因为当时我们还在上大学，世界各地的企业和各种规模的公司都在使用非常糟糕的技术。你所能做的就是这个门槛太低了.我们的第一个应用程序非常可怕，但是门槛太低了，你所要做的就是解决一些基本的问题，然后在那些IT环境中的最终用户，在那些企业中，突然想要采用你的技术。我们发现，世界各地的人和各种规模的公司-不管是财富500强公司-在科技或小型企业上花费了数亿美元，每个人都对非常简单的工具有兴趣和需求。当时我们的竞争对手之一，你用来分享信息的初级产品看起来有点像这样。这是其中一个产品的屏幕截图。

It's a pretty horribly designed  technology.

这是一项设计得相当糟糕的技术。

I don't know even what it says.

我甚至不知道上面写的是什么。

It's just a screen grab from the  internet, but like really not elegant software for working with other people and collaborating. What  sort of started out for us as a really simple way to share files, it  was like that dead simple of a proposition, actually turned out that it was the  sort of crux of how people could be working in the future.

这只是网际网路上的一次屏幕抓拍，但就像一款非常不优雅的软件，可以和其他人一起工作和合作。对于我们来说，这是一种简单的文件共享方式，就像一个非常简单的命题，实际上它是人们未来工作的关键。

It was a  much easier way for people to be able to work. We're getting a little security  prompt. Of course, that has to happen. Okay. What started out as a really simple  way to share files turned into this new way of working. We weren't trying to  solve this vast problem of how could companies work in a modern way. All we  were trying to do was build really simple technology that makes it easy for people  to share files and access information from anywhere. Then we eventually evolved the strategy. Things  were growing so quickly that we basically decided ... Like any classic startup story, we  decided to get in a minivan and drop out of college and move to the  Bay Area to go and build the company. There's always this part in the story  where if you kind of roll back in time ... This was us living and  working out of a renovated garage. That thing behind us is actually technically ...

对人们来说，这是一种容易得多的工作方式。我们得到了一个小小的安全提示。当然，这必须发生。好的。最初是一种简单的文件共享方式，后来变成了这种新的工作方式。我们并没有试图解决企业如何以现代方式运作这一巨大问题。我们所要做的就是构建一个非常简单的技术，让人们可以在任何地方共享文件和获取信息。然后我们最终制定了这个策略。事情发展得太快了，我们基本上决定.就像任何一个典型的创业故事一样，我们决定坐上一辆小型货车，从大学退学，搬到湾区去建立公司。故事中总是有这样的部分，如果你回到过去.这是我们在修缮过的车库里生活和工作的地方。从技术上讲，我们身后的那个东西.

It's  actually zoned as a garage, but we were living out of it.

它实际上是作为一个车库，但我们住在那里。

It was actually  pretty illegal. The four founders just going out and we all dropped out of college  and building out this. What we didn't yet fully know was this enterprise software company  eventually would become a whole enterprise software platform.

实际上是非常违法的。这四位创始人刚走出去，我们都从大学退学了，建立起了这座建筑。我们还没有完全知道的是，这个企业软件公司最终会成为一个完整的企业软件平台。

It's funny because when you're dropping out,  what you imagine, the glory of, "Okay.

这很有趣，因为当你退学的时候，你想象的那种荣耀，“好吧。

I'm leaving school. This is going to be  so glorious. Think about all the people that dropped out before us. You have Bill  Gates. Bill Gates dropped out. This is going to be so exciting. Then you've got  Steve Jobs. He dropped out. This is super exciting. Michael Dell dropped out. That's super  exciting, but nobody ever really remembers this guy." We always sort of think about the  glorious stories of dropping out. Actually I don't even know if this guy dropped out,  but it looks like he must have or had to do something. We were so  pumped. We're like, "We're dropping out of college. Fuck this. We're going to go start  a software company." We were in this position where we were living and working all  together and we were iterating on our business over and over again. We were pivoting  almost every single day.

我要离开学校了。这将是如此辉煌。想想那些在我们之前辍学的人。比尔·盖茨。比尔·盖茨退学了。一定会很刺激的。那你就有史蒂夫·乔布斯了。他退学了。太令人兴奋了。迈克尔·戴尔退学了。这太令人兴奋了，但没人真正记得这个人。“我们总是在想那些光荣的辍学故事。实际上，我甚至不知道这个家伙是否辍学了，但看起来他必须或必须做些什么。我们太激动了。我们就像，”我们要退学了。去他妈的。我们要创办一家软件公司。“我们处在这样的境地，我们一起生活和工作，我们一次又一次地重复我们的业务。我们几乎每天都在旋转。

If you've ever done a startup, what you find is like  maybe every 24 hours you're sort of reflecting on your business model and your strategy  and is it going to work, do you think it's going to scale, are the  economics actually going to play out. We got to this juncture where we basically had  to say, "Do we want to be a company that serves consumers or do we  want to be a company that serves businesses?" The reason that we got to that  junction was we had consumers that were spending I think at the time I think  the most you could spend on our product was $9.99 a cents. Pretty standard consumer  software payment structure.

如果你曾经做过一家创业公司，你会发现你每24小时就会思考一次你的商业模式和你的战略，你认为它会成功吗？你认为它会扩大规模吗？经济学真的会发挥作用吗？我们到了这个关键时刻，我们基本上不得不说，“我们想成为一家为消费者服务的公司，还是想成为一家为商业服务的公司？”我们之所以到了那个交汇点，是因为我们有消费者在消费，我认为当时我认为我们的产品最多能花9.99美元一美分。相当标准的消费者软件支付结构。

It was about 10 bucks a month, but what we saw was  that companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and Microsoft eventually would be giving everybody  free storage on the internet and that you really wouldn't want to be spending money  for storage on the internet. Maybe just as a quick survey, who actually pays for  more storage in one of the storage solutions that you're using? Oh wow. Okay. All  right. You guys just create a lot of data or something? What's going on here?  All right. Okay. Who doesn't pay? Okay. Right. Not a great business model when you  only have about maybe 35% or so of the market that's willing to upgrade for  your solution. You want to be able to reach a broader population than that. What  we said was at some point Google, Facebook and others were going to give away  unlimited space and it was going to be really, really hard to upsell people over  time. That was on the consumer side. On the enterprise side though, what we realized  was actually companies were spending millions and millions of dollars on software that we thought  we could do with at a smaller amount of spend and for a fraction of  the price. Companies on one hand were spending millions or tens of millions of dollars  and we thought we could deliver it to them for maybe hundreds of thousands of  dollars. You could have almost a 10 or 20x improvement on sort of the cost  of the service. On the other hand we felt that at most we could charge  consumers maybe $10 per month and that would actually have downward pressure over time just  because of the economics of the space where storage is getting cheaper.

这大约是一个月10美元，但我们看到的是，谷歌、Facebook、苹果和微软等公司最终将在互联网上为所有人提供免费存储，而你真的不想花钱在互联网上存储。也许作为一个快速的调查，谁来支付更多的存储在您正在使用的存储解决方案中？哦哇哦。好的。好吧。你们只是创造了很多数据什么的？这里发生了什么事？好的好的。谁不付钱？好的。右（边），正确的当你只有大约35%的市场愿意为你的解决方案升级的时候，这并不是一个很好的商业模式。你希望能够接触到更广泛的人群。我们说的是，在某个时候，谷歌、Facebook和其他公司将提供无限的空间，而且随着时间的推移，要想让人更好地推销是非常困难的。这是在消费者方面。然而，在企业方面，我们意识到的是，实际上公司在软件上花费了数百万美元，我们认为我们可以较小的花费和一小部分的价格来完成这些工作。一方面，公司正在花费数百万或数千万美元，我们认为我们可以几十万美元的价格将其交付给他们。您可以在某种程度上提高服务成本的10倍或20倍。另一方面，我们认为最多只能向消费者收取每月10美元的费用，这实际上会带来长期的下行压力，这仅仅是因为存储空间越来越便宜的经济原因。

It actually took  us a surprising amount of time to come to the conclusion that we needed to  go in the enterprise because we still were like well, yeah, but what if we  could serve advertising on the files or something? It just turns out you really don't  want to see ads when you're looking at your tax documents or your photos. We  didn't think that the advertising model was going to work for consumers, but we did  decide that actually if you could build really, really great enterprise software that could solve  all of the enterprise's problems around managing information and collaborating around files and you could  build one platform for being able to do that, that maybe you could actually compress  some of the economics in the market and be fairly disruptive to the traditional players.  We sort of stepped back and we said, "Okay.

事实上，我们花了很长时间才得出这样的结论：我们需要进入企业，因为我们仍然很好，是的，但是如果我们可以在文件或其他方面提供广告呢？事实证明，当你看你的税务文件或照片时，你真的不想看到广告。我们不认为广告模式会对消费者有效，但我们确实决定，如果您能够构建非常棒的企业软件，可以围绕管理信息和围绕文件进行协作来解决企业的所有问题，那么您可以构建一个平台来实现这一点，也许您可以压缩一些经济学知识。并对传统玩家造成相当大的破坏。我们后退了一步，说：“好的。

If we're going to do this,  are we really going to build an enterprise software company?" We were 23 and 22  at the time, the founding team, and we had a few other employees. There's like  a long list of things that you could do that aren't very cool. Somewhere near  the bottom of that list when you're 23 and 22 is starting an enterprise software  company.

如果我们要这么做的话，我们真的要建立一家企业软件公司吗？“我们当时是23岁和22岁的创始团队，我们还有几个其他的员工。你可以做的事情很多，并不是很酷。当你23岁和22岁的时候，在这个列表的最下面的某个地方，你正在创办一家企业软件公司。

If you just had like a quadrant, like a McKenzie quadrant of like lamest  things possible to do, it's starting an enterprise software company. We were pretty sort of  distraught of this idea of like are we going to go and build a company  like an Oracle or an SAP or something? Is that really going to be fun  because think about what we think about. When I say the words enterprise and B2B,  what you should be thinking of if you have some experience in the space is  you should be thinking like okay, it's like slow companies that don't innovate quickly, the  technology is way too expensive, you're just selling to the buyer, you're not really selling  to the user, the technology itself is super complex. There's really no incentive structure to  make really simple enterprise software. The reason for that is that because the people who  have the budget don't actually have to deal with the complexity of the technology. They  don't actually prioritize simplicity and user experience when they're making buying decisions. You have to  deal with frustrating sales reps.

如果你只是像一个象限，像一个麦肯齐象限一样，最愚蠢的事情可以做，它是成立一个企业软件公司。我们有点心烦意乱，想要去创建一个像甲骨文、SAP之类的公司吗？会不会很有趣因为想想我们在想什么。当我说“企业和B2B”这个词时，你应该想到的是，如果你在这个领域有经验的话，你应该思考得很好，就像缓慢的公司不能快速创新，技术太贵，你只是卖给买家，你不是真的要卖给用户，技术本身是超级复杂的。没有真正的激励结构来制作真正简单的企业软件。这样做的原因是因为有预算的人实际上不需要处理技术的复杂性。当他们做出购买决定时，他们实际上并没有把简单性和用户体验放在优先位置。你必须对付令人沮丧的销售代表。

If you're on the other end of buying enterprise software,  what ends up happening is you're just getting called all day long by sales reps  for software that you basically don't want. There's unfriendly policy terms.

如果你是在购买企业软件的另一端，最终发生的是你整天都在被你根本不想要的软件的销售代表打电话。有一些不友好的政策条款。

It's always terms of  services that favor the vendor, not favor the customer. The very structure of the contract  in this industry are totally not favorable to the client. Software design is pretty horrible  because again if you don't have a market that is prioritizing user experience or simplicity,  then you can't get the best designers because the best designers don't want to work  at companies that aren't building really simple software. Then what's the point of having great  design and so then the design ends up sucking. You get really infrequent updates.

服务条款总是对供应商有利，而不是对客户有利。这一行业的合同结构本身对客户完全不利。软件设计是非常可怕的，因为如果你没有一个优先考虑用户体验或简单性的市场，那么你就找不到最好的设计师，因为最好的设计师不想在那些没有开发真正简单的软件的公司工作。那么，拥有伟大的设计又有什么意义呢？你真的很少得到更新。

It  turns out when you sell to enterprises, this actually make sense. Enterprises want a lot  of predictability. They don't want their technology changing on them at the same rate that  Snapchat or Facebook is able to change their software for us. Because if I'm a  CIO, chief information officer, of a 20 or 50,000 person company and my software vendor  is changing all the time, that's going to make it so I have to go  retrain my employees. What that then means is that the software vendors don't want to  update their software and don't want to update their technology a lot because the customers  want it to be infrequently updated. That then slows down all of your innovation.

事实证明，当你向企业销售时，这实际上是有意义的。企业需要很多可预见性。他们不希望他们的技术以Snapchat或Facebook能够为我们改变软件的速度改变。因为如果我是一家20或5万人公司的首席信息官，而我的软件供应商一直在变化，那就会使我不得不重新培训我的员工。这就意味着软件供应商不想更新他们的软件，也不想更新他们的技术，因为客户希望它很少被更新。这就减缓了你所有的创新。

Imagine  working at a company where you ship product updates maybe once a year or once  every three years, that's pretty annoying. You're not going to get the best innovation. You  have all this downtime just because it's just really creaky technology that always has these  weird problems that you run into, corrupted data. The list could be about five times  longer.

想象一下，在一家公司工作，你可能每年发布一次产品更新，或者每三年发布一次，这让人非常讨厌。你不会得到最好的创新。你有这么多的停机时间，仅仅是因为你经常遇到这些奇怪的问题，破坏了数据，这是非常不可靠的技术。名单可能会长五倍。

If you were to make a list of like what words describe the enterprise  software industry, this is just getting started.

如果你要列出一些描述企业软件行业的词汇，这才刚刚开始。

If you kind of took it all together  and you rounded it all together basically like the picture that people have in their  head when you say enterprise software is basically like this, it's just your vendor just  being angry at you. Actually it looks a little bit more like this, it's a  little bit more pirate oriented. This is basically what enterprise software companies when they think  about enterprise technology vendors at least 10 years ago. We said okay, if we're going  to pivot the company and we're going to forego all the fun and all the  exciting times we would have as a consumer company, then we have to find a  way to build an enterprise software company that operates and acts and innovates and moves  like a consumer company.

如果你把所有的东西都放在一起，然后把它们加在一起，就像人们脑海中的图片，当你说企业软件基本上是这样的时候，那只是你的供应商在生你的气。实际上它看起来更像这个，它更多的是以海盗为导向的。这基本上是企业软件公司在至少10年前考虑企业技术供应商时所做的事情。我们说，好吧，如果我们要让公司重新发展，我们要放弃所有的乐趣和所有令人兴奋的时光，我们作为一个消费者公司，那么我们必须找到一种方法来建立一个企业软件公司，它可以像消费者公司那样运作、创新和行动。

If we're going to forego the consumer side and serving just  consumers in their personal lives, we still have to find a way to build a  company that feels like a consumer company that just happens to sell to enterprises. Then  we made a list of basically what are the things that are changing in the  technology world that allow for you to build a company in a very different way.  This is I think what makes enterprise software so exciting for all of us today  which is why I think it might not be still the number one coolest thing  to do of all time, but it's at least in getting the top 300 options.  We said okay, if we're going to build a different enterprise software company, what is  true today? This is back in 2006 and 2007. What is true in 2006 and  7 that allows us to build a different kind of enterprise software company? Well, the  first is let's look at the old way. The old way was get really complex  technology.

如果我们要放弃消费者的利益，在他们的个人生活中只为消费者服务，我们仍然需要找到一种方法来建立一家感觉像一家消费者公司的公司，这种公司恰好是卖给企业的。然后，我们列出了一个基本的列表，说明在技术世界中正在发生哪些变化，使你能够以一种非常不同的方式建立一家公司。这就是我认为企业软件让我们今天如此兴奋的原因，这就是为什么我认为它可能不是有史以来做的最酷的事情，但至少在获得前300个选项方面是如此。我们说好了，如果我们要建立一个不同的企业软件公司，今天是什么情况？这要追溯到2006年和2007年。在2006年和7年间，允许我们建立一家不同类型的企业软件公司的是什么？首先，让我们来看看旧的方式。旧的方法是获得非常复杂的技术。

It was all about the sales. What's your distribution channel? You had to have  sales people as your primary way into getting you the customers because customers couldn't access  your technology on their own. They had to install it. To install it, you had  to have a sales person go out and try and pitch the customer that they  should start using it. All of your distribution was constrained by the number of sales  reps that you had. Technology was only available to the biggest companies. This ends up  being a pretty big flaw because if you're trying to go have a massive impact  on the world, but only the Fortune 500 can actually afford to use your technology  because nobody else has the infrastructure or the apparatus to be able to install the  technology, then really you're not having that big of an impact on the world. You're  just having a big impact on the top enterprises that are out there. We saw  a lot of flaws with how technology sort of solve the security problem. When you  buy enterprise software 10 years ago, you bought the infrastructure or the hardware, then you  bought software, then you bought security software to secure the software and the hardware. Bless  you. You had all of this technology that you had to have. Buy from lots  of different vendors and it was the customer's responsibility for putting it all together. That  meant that there was a lot of security vulnerability inside of those platforms. There's also  a thing where the customer is bearing the risks because what happens is the customer  is buying the licenses for the software upfront regardless of what they use. You have  this sort of assymetry where the vendor always wins because the customer is buying the  software in perpetuity essentially. Then what's happening is even if the software doesn't work for  them, the customers already paid. You see all the time you'd have these software projects  that enterprises would have where they've spent $10 million on software and they'd never install  it because it wasn't what they wanted and there's no recourse. Once they bought it,  they can't do anything about it. Pretty fundamental broken business model. Then finally, the platforms  themselves were fairly proprietary. They were closed systems. They weren't integrated and open to other  platforms.

一切都是关于销售的。你的分销渠道是什么？您必须有销售人员作为您获得客户的主要途径，因为客户无法单独访问您的技术。他们必须安装它。要安装它，您必须有一个销售人员出去，并试图向客户推销，他们应该开始使用它。您的所有发行版都受到销售代表数量的限制。技术只适用于大公司。这最终是一个很大的缺陷，因为如果你想要对世界产生巨大的影响，但是只有财富500强才有能力使用你的技术，因为没有其他人拥有能够安装这项技术的基础设施或设备，那么你真的不会对世界产生那么大的影响。你只是对外面的顶级企业产生了很大的影响。我们看到了技术如何解决安全问题方面的许多缺陷。当你在10年前购买企业软件时，你购买了基础设施或硬件，然后你购买了软件，然后你购买了安全软件来保护软件和硬件。保佑你。你拥有所有你必须拥有的技术。从许多不同的供应商购买，这是客户的责任，把所有的东西放在一起。这意味着这些平台内部存在许多安全漏洞。还有一件事是，客户承担风险，因为不管软件使用的是什么，客户都会提前购买软件许可证。您有这样一种不对称度量，供应商总是获胜，因为客户从本质上说是在永久地购买软件。那么现在发生的情况是，即使软件对他们不起作用，客户也已经付费了。你可以看到，所有这些软件项目都是企业在软件上花费1000万美元的地方，他们永远不会安装，因为这不是他们想要的，也没有追索权。一旦他们买了它，他们就什么也做不了。基本破坏的商业模式。最后，这些平台本身是相当专有的。它们是封闭的系统。它们并不是集成的，也不向其他平台开放。

It was very proprietary technology. We said well, what if there's a new version  of each of these things? What if you can make it so the technology was  simple and elegant and we always focused on the end user and we never lost  sight of the power of the end user? What if the product was actually pulled  into organizations by those end users, as opposed to you having to only do top  down sales? What if the software was so good and so freely available that anyone  could bring it into the workplace on their own? What if it was available to  people inside of organizations of all sizes? What if it could be a small business  anywhere around the world? What if it could be a large enterprise? What if it  could be a three person startup? How could you make that technology available to anybody  of all size? How could you make sure that security was baked in so the  customer doesn't have to buy all this other technology and wrap it around these tools?  What if the vendor could bear more of the risk? If you're a customer of  ours and the technology's not working, you're not going to renew. What if more of  that risk to making sure you're successful is actually something that the vendor has to  focus on? Then finally, what if you had open systems? What if you connected to  all the different enterprise software that people were using and you didn't have a closed  platform that locked in data? We kind of said okay, there's this old way that  the Oracles of the world built their technology and then there's a new way. What  if we could go describe each of these new things that was different about technology  today and go build an enterprise software company that really solved this core set of  issues? That's essentially what we've been working on for the past decade. We said here  are the new conditions of this landscape. Let's build a software company for the enterprise  that is built and operates like a consumer company. That's been our strategy since about  2007. Fortunately what's cool is that it has played out in favor of a lot  of the things that we've been talking about that we identified. We now have about  71,000 customers. We're about 63% of the Fortune 500. This was generated mostly because people  just at work wanted to bring in better technology and then we eventually were able  to sell to the broader organization, but it was really about solving for that user,  pulling the technology into the workplace and then ultimately solving a bunch of problems from  there. The exciting thing about what has played out in the cloud is that you  have companies of all sizes and in all industries that are now transforming the way  they work because of the cloud. We can work with companies as wide ranging as  Pixar where they use Box to be able to share and collaborate around movies, to  Nike where they use Box for product and marketing, all the way Eli Lilly where  you have things like R&D and drug discover and various kind of medical discoveries happening  and collaborating around through Box as well. What's cool is it doesn't matter the industry.  Companies of all sizes have realized all of this potential for moving to the cloud.  We are one of many companies that are benefiting from this set of trends. The  cool thing I think for all of us and for anybody starting a company in  this space is that really this is just the beginning of a whole significant change  in this industry. Going back 10 years, I thought it was the beginning, but it  was still a pretty slow start to kind of get to where we are today.  If I look at all of the trends that are happening in the enterprise, I  think the best opportunities are actually yet to come. This means that there's going to  be more growth and more opportunity than ever before. The reason for this is basically  you have two big factors. First is most of the technologies still used by enterprises  is still that legacy technology.

这是非常专有的技术。我们说，如果每一种东西都有一个新版本呢？如果你能做到这样的技术是简单和优雅的，我们总是关注最终用户，我们从未忘记最终用户的力量呢？如果产品实际上是被那些最终用户拉进组织的，而不是你只需要做自上而下的销售呢？如果这个软件是如此的好，如此的免费，以至于任何人都可以自己把它带到工作场所，那该怎么办？如果所有规模的组织内部的人都可以使用呢？如果它在世界任何地方都可能是一家小企业呢？如果这可能是一家大型企业呢？如果是三人创业呢？你怎么能把这项技术提供给任何大小的人？你怎样才能确保安全措施已经就绪，这样客户就不必购买所有其他技术，并将其包装在这些工具上？如果供应商能够承担更多的风险呢？如果你是我们的客户，而技术不起作用，你就不会更新。如果更多的风险，以确保你是成功的，实际上是供应商必须关注的事情呢？那么，最后，如果您有开放的系统呢？如果您连接到人们正在使用的所有不同的企业软件，而没有一个锁定数据的封闭平台，该怎么办？我们说，好吧，世界上的圣贤们有一种古老的方式来建立他们的技术，然后就有了一种新的方式。如果我们能够描述当今技术上不同的每一个新事物，并建立一个真正解决了这些核心问题的企业软件公司，又该怎么办呢？这是我们在过去十年里一直在研究的。我们说过，这里是这片土地的新情况。让我们为企业建立一家软件公司，它的建立和运作就像消费者公司一样。自2007年以来，这一直是我们的策略。幸运的是，最酷的是，我们已经发现了很多我们一直在谈论的事情。我们现在有大约71，000名客户。我们大约占财富500强的63%。这主要是因为工作中的人们想要引进更好的技术，然后我们最终能够卖给更广泛的组织，但这实际上是为了解决用户的问题，把技术引入工作场所，然后最终解决大量的问题。令人兴奋的是，在云中所发生的事情是，你拥有各种规模和所有行业的公司，这些公司正因为云而改变它们的工作方式。我们可以和像Pixar这样的公司合作，在那里他们可以使用Box来分享和合作电影，到耐克(Nike)，在那里他们使用Box进行产品和营销，在Eli Lilly那里有研发和药物发现之类的东西，还有各种各样的医学发现，以及通过Box进行的协作。最酷的是，这个行业并不重要。各种规模的公司都意识到了向云转移的所有潜力。我们是从这一系列趋势中受益的许多公司之一。我认为，对我们所有人和任何在这一领域成立公司的人来说，最酷的事情是，这真的只是整个行业重大变革的开始。十年前，我以为这是个开始，但要达到今天的水平，这仍然是一个相当缓慢的开始。如果我看看企业中正在发生的所有趋势，我认为最好的机会实际上还没有到来。这意味着中国经济将比以往任何时候都有更多的增长和更多的机会。这样做的原因基本上有两大因素。首先，大多数企业仍然使用的技术仍然是遗留技术。

It's still old.

它还很旧。

It's slow.

太慢了。

It's complex.

很复杂。

It's expensive.

太贵了。

It's  sold by the legacy vendors. On one hand, you just have this gigantic market of  old stuff that is going to have to get retired, shut down and moved to  the cloud. That's the first thing. The other trend is that every business on the  planet is recognizing that that legacy technology is not going to let them transform their  business models, the way that they serve their customers, the way that they operate. You're  probably familiar with the fact that every single company on the planet at this point  knows they need to modernize their organization in some significant way.

它是由旧货销售商出售的。一方面，这个庞大的旧货市场将不得不退休，关闭，搬到云端。这是第一件事。另一种趋势是，地球上的每一家企业都认识到，传统技术不会让他们改变自己的商业模式，改变他们为客户服务的方式，以及他们的运作方式。您可能很熟悉这样一个事实，即地球上的每一家公司都知道他们需要以某种重要的方式实现组织的现代化。

If you're a media  company, you're freaking out because of Netflix.

如果你是一家媒体公司，你会因为Netflix而抓狂。

If you're a life sciences company, you're freaking  out because of 23andMe.

如果你是一家生命科学公司，你会因为23和Me而抓狂。

If you're a financial services company, you're freaking out because of  Stripe.

如果你是一家金融服务公司，你会因为Stripe而抓狂。

If you're a hospitality company, you're freaking out because of Airbnb. Every single company  in every single industry recognizes that you have all of these disruptive forces coming from  the digital industries and Silicon Valley and broader than Silicon Valley and that every single  company is going to have to operate and upgrade both the technology that they use  as well as the sort of business models that they have. What's cool is if  you're building for enterprises, that means there's an unbelievable amount of opportunity because all of  those companies, all the Fortune 500 and all the other companies that need to be  transforming are going to need modern software to be able to work and operate in  this new way. They're going to need new technology that allows them to be able  to actually compete effectively with the digital economy. That means for all of us that  there's more opportunity than ever before. Because if I go back 10 years ago, there  wasn't actually a significant catalyst for enterprises to go upgrade their IT systems and their  technology systems. Today that catalyst is just the fact that every company is being disrupted  in sort of every single that they look at the market. That just means that  you have this catalyst which is if I am General Electric or I'm a Walmart  or I'm a Procter & Gamble, I need to be working with startups and new  suppliers that are going to make more effective and more competitive which means that then  there's opportunity if you're building for B2B.

如果你是一家酒店公司，你会因为Airbnb而抓狂。每个行业的每一家公司都认识到，所有这些颠覆性的力量都来自数字产业和硅谷，比硅谷还要广泛，每一家公司都必须运营和升级他们所使用的技术以及他们所拥有的商业模式。酷的是，如果你在为企业建设，这意味着有一个难以置信的机会，因为所有这些公司，所有财富500强和所有其他需要转变的公司都需要现代软件，才能以这种新的方式工作和运作。他们将需要新的技术，使他们能够真正有效地与数字经济竞争。这对我们所有人来说意味着比以往任何时候都有更多的机会。因为如果我回到10年前，实际上并没有一个重要的催化剂来推动企业升级他们的IT系统和技术系统。今天，这种催化剂只不过是这样一个事实：每一家公司都在被打乱，几乎每一家公司都在关注市场。这就意味着，如果我是通用电气(GeneralElectric)、沃尔玛(Walmart)或宝洁(Procter&Gamble)，我需要与初创公司和新供应商合作，让它们变得更有效、更有竞争力。这意味着，如果你在打造B2B，就会有机会。

If I can convince you to build an  enterprise software company, here are some lessons that we have learned. A lot of these  actually apply probably for most markets. They're ones that we have specifically taken from building  for the B2B market, but certainly a lot of these apply whether you're building a  consumer app or a medical device company or any kind of entrepreneurial activity. Here are  I think eight lessons that we've taken from our journey and a few that I've  learned from other companies over the years as well that I'll try and weave in.  Some of the things that we've been thinking about. The first is and this one  we ...

如果我能说服你建立一个企业软件公司，以下是我们学到的一些教训。其中很多实际上可能适用于大多数市场。它们是我们专门为B2B市场构建的产品，但无论你是在开发消费应用程序，还是医疗设备公司，还是任何类型的创业活动，这些都适用于我们。这是我从我们的旅程中学到的八个教训，也是我多年来从其他公司学到的一些经验，我也会试着融入其中。我们一直在想的事情。第一个是我们.。

It has been just the foundational way that we got started which is  start with something insanely simple and then focus on expanding it over time. When we  got started, if you were in enterprise IT or you worked at one of our  competitors like Microsoft or SAP or in Oracle and you looked at our software, you  literally would have died laughing. You would have looked at our technology and you'd be  like, "That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen." All it does is you upload  a file and then you access the file.

这只是我们开始的基本方式，从一些极其简单的东西开始，然后把重点放在随着时间的推移扩展它。当我们开始工作的时候，如果你在企业IT部门工作，或者你在我们的竞争对手如微软、SAP或甲骨文公司工作，你看着我们的软件，你会笑死的。你会看到我们的技术，你会说：“这是我见过的最愚蠢的事情。”它所做的就是上传一个文件，然后访问该文件。

It was that simplicity that was actually  why it was so disruptive because all of those vendors thought that the problem was  we just need to jam in as many features as humanly possible into one piece  of software. That was correlated with our value proposition. That was sort of how enterprise  software companies operated. Mostly because we weren't focused on the enterprise, we just took the  opposite approach. We said actually the fewer features, the simpler set of functionality in one  place is actually going to be our value proposition.

正是因为这种简单，这才是它如此具有破坏性的原因，因为所有这些供应商都认为问题在于，我们只需要将尽可能多的功能插入到一个软件中。这与我们的价值主张相关。企业软件公司就是这样运作的。主要是因为我们没有专注于企业，所以我们采取了相反的方法。我们说过，实际上功能越少，一个地方的功能就越简单，这就是我们的价值主张。

If you were in classic enterprise  software, you would have looked at our product and you would have thought it was  a toy essentially. You would have been like, "That is never going to serve enterprises.  It's not going to serve regulated businesses.

如果你是一个经典的企业软件，你会看到我们的产品，你会认为它本质上是一个玩具。你可能会说，“这永远不会为企业服务，也不会为受监管的企业服务。”

It's not going to serve complex work flows."  What they didn't recognize was that was just the start. That was just our day  one use case. That was the day one thing that we were trying to solve.  The instinct and the tendency and this still happens today like at our company 12  years later when we've learned this I think so directly, you still have this tendency.  Anybody in this room that goes out and brainstorms like how could we build a  big enterprise software company, you're going to brainstorm by like listing out lots and lots  and lots of things. You're going to list out lots and lots and lots of  features. This wishlist of what if you could just build all this cool shit. That's  not how actually how you're going to be successful. You're going to be successful by  nailing one use case that just happens to be a use case that everybody has  a massive problem with.

这不会为复杂的工作流程服务。“他们不知道的是这只是个开始。那只是我们的第一天用例。那是我们试图解决的一件事。这种本能和趋势-这种情况在今天仍然发生-就像12年后我们公司学到的那样-我这么认为，你还是有这种倾向的。在这个房间里，任何一个人，如果我们能建立一家大型的企业软件公司，你就会像列出很多事情一样，头脑风暴起来。你会列出很多特性。如果你能建立所有这些酷屎的愿望清单。这并不是你如何获得成功的方式。你会成功的，因为你把一个用例钉住了，而这个用例恰好是每个人都有一个很大问题的用例。

If you can nail that one use case, that becomes essentially  the wedge to then use to expand out to all the other use cases that  you want to go and solve. You have to sort of resist the natural instinct  which is that more functionality, more powerful software is better and really make sure that  you're focused on one thing that you're going to do better than everybody else. A  great example that I've been rereminded of this over and over from is a company  called Gusto that was previously called ZenPayroll. What they did was they just said that  payroll software and payroll services sucks in small businesses as an example. They built a  software application that was just about making sure your employees get paid as efficiently as  possible. Then eventually that was so successful and they got embedded into so many businesses  that they could eventually expand to more and more HR services and more and more  things that an HR team has to do with their employees. They started with that  one use case which is let's just get payroll right, make it so successful, so  simple, so effective that then you could build up over time. Again when starting out,  you have to resist the urge to want to build a lot of functionality and  really focus on one use case that people are going to be able to easily  describe to other people and then be able to go from there. That's the first  lesson. Again 12 years in we're still having to relearn this over and over again.  The amount of product meetings that I end up in where we have to be  like we have to remove that feature, we have to hide that thing, we have  to make that simpler, it never goes away. Even when you're bigger, you still have  to make sure you're really, really focused on keeping things dead simple and almost deceptively  simple in what you're actually going to go and do for the customer. Because it  just turns out that in these cases having less functionality gives people way more opportunity  then go use your service and it's counterintuitive. The more functionality you have, the more  you're going to narrow the set of customers that ultimately are going to be able  to sort of make sense of your product and want to use your product. That's  the first thing.

如果你能确定一个用例，那基本上就变成了楔子，然后用它来扩展到你想要解决的所有其他用例。你必须抵制自然的本能，那就是更多的功能，更强大的软件更好，并确保你专注于一件事情，你会比其他人做得更好。我一遍又一遍地重复这一点的一个很好的例子是一家名为Gusto的公司，它以前被称为ZenPayroll。他们只是说工资软件和工资单服务在小企业中很烂，举个例子。他们开发了一个软件应用程序，确保你的员工能尽可能高效地拿到薪水。最后，这是非常成功的，他们融入了这么多的企业，最终他们可以扩展到越来越多的人力资源服务和更多的事情，人力资源团队与他们的员工有关。他们从一个用例开始，那就是让我们正确地获得工资，使它如此成功，如此简单，如此有效，这样您就可以随着时间的推移而建立起来。同样地，当你开始的时候，你必须抵制想要构建很多功能的冲动，并且真正专注于一个用例，人们可以很容易地向其他人描述这些用例，然后才能从那里开始。这是第一课。12年过去了，我们仍然不得不一次又一次地重新学习。产品会议的数量，我在这里结束，我们必须删除这个功能，我们必须隐藏，我们必须使它更简单，它永远不会消失。即使你变大了，你仍然必须确保你真的，真的非常专注于让事情变得简单，并且在你真正要为客户做的事情上，保持几乎是表面上的简单。因为事实证明，在这种情况下，功能越少，人们就会有更多的机会去使用你的服务，这是违反直觉的。您拥有的功能越多，您就越会缩小最终能够理解您的产品并希望使用您的产品的一组客户。这是第一件事。

I think that as you're starting your company you really need to  think hard about this one which is make sure that you're benefiting form a major  technology tailwind. There's so many companies that get started where there's no particular macro technology  trend that they're riding on top of.

我认为当你开始你的公司的时候，你真的需要认真考虑这个问题，那就是确保你从一个主要的技术顺风中受益。很多公司刚起步的时候，并没有什么特别的宏观技术趋势。

In some cases even worst. There could be  technology trends that you're sort of resisting or that are sort of points of friction  for you. You really have to think hard about what is going on in the  technology landscape that I am going to be able to ride that wave with my  innovation where the growth of whatever that technology trend is is something that I can  then grow alongside.

在某些情况下甚至更糟。可能有一些技术趋势，你是在抵抗，或者是对你来说是摩擦点。你真的必须认真考虑一下技术领域正在发生的事情-我将能够与我的创新一起驾驭这股浪潮-无论是什么技术趋势的增长，都是我可以一起成长的东西。

In our case we benefited from three or four mega trends. We  benefited from the growth of mobile. We benefited from the lower cost of computing. We  benefited from the fact that everybody was coming onto the internet. All three of those  trends were disruptive to our incumbents that were selling traditional enterprise software. We were able  to take these mega trends that we had nothing to do with, take these mega  trends, ride on top of them and they were just an onslaught of basically disaster  for the traditional competitors in the space. Try and find what are the technology trends  that you think incumbents are not going to be able to respond well to because  they're sort of economically, strategically or from a talent standpoint not able to leverage those  technology trends in the same way that you can. PlanGrid is a pretty cool example  of this. They basically do software for construction companies and for architecture firms and builders  to be able to let you do blueprints and other kind of construction projects on  the iPad and the iPhone.

在我们的例子中，我们受益于三四大趋势。我们得益于移动业务的增长。我们受益于较低的计算成本。我们受益于每个人都上网的事实。所有这三种趋势都对我们销售传统企业软件的现任者造成了破坏。我们能够抓住这些与我们无关的巨大趋势，抓住这些巨大的趋势，在它们之上，它们只是对太空中传统竞争对手的一次基本灾难的冲击。试着找出那些你认为现任者无法很好地应对的技术趋势，因为他们在经济上、战略上或从人才的角度来看，都无法像你一样利用这些技术趋势。PlanGrid就是一个很酷的例子。他们基本上是为建筑公司、建筑公司和建筑商做软件，以便让你在iPad和iPhone上做蓝图和其他类型的建筑项目。

It's a pretty dead simple idea, but it's going after  just the fact that there's billions of dollars spent every single year on either software  that is stuck on your computer or paper-based processes. They could basically ride the growth  of mobile and the growth of mobile in this sort of field worker scenarios to  be able to grow with that. They nailed the timing perfectly of okay, it was  a couple years after the iPad. Now's the time where these devices are going to  start to show up in physical environments. What is the software that we need to  do to be able to let construction teams and building companies be able to use  that technology? Really make sure that you're going to benefit significantly from a major tailwind  and don't create unnecessarily head winds for yourself. Your product in a perfect world should  really literally sell itself. This is again when you're going out and you're building for  the enterprise, instinctively you're not thinking about how can I make the product be that  sort of point of viral adoption. Because we're so used to building up sales teams  and building up all the customer relationships which are still important because you're still going  to have to use probably sales to ultimately close large deals with clients, but make  sure that the product itself is something that can be adopted, spread and utilized without  any friction by the end user. Sales really should be used to close big deals,  not to drive product adoption and that's a big distinction in the traditional enterprise software  world where sales was sort of the only way that you could push out production  adoption into companies. We put a huge emphasis on all of our sharing functionality in  Box. When you had a document that you wanted to share, we wanted to make  it really, really, really simple to be able to share those files around. Then the  software would spread itself as opposed to us having to just keep selling it into  companies like the traditional enterprise software vendors were doing. Then you use sales to close  bigger deals essentially, to help sort of navigate in that customer environment. Slack today is  sort of the perfect quintessential example of a viral enterprise software product where the very  usage of the service is to then spread to other people because by definition you're  communicating with other people. They've really done this extremely well which is make sure that  you're building a product that is as easy to adopt and as viral as possible.  Every single thing about that product is tuned for the end user to be able  to be empowered to spread it on their own so they can build their own  sort of viral distribution channel. Sales then comes in later and then you can sell  additional services or capabilities to that enterprise. You really want to have a bifurcation between  product adoption and sales, sort of making sure that you're doing the bigger deals. Bless  you. Okay. Next one. Spend time, a lot of time, with your futuristic customers, but  don't exactly just build what they're asking for. What happens when you're building for the  enterprise, you will always have ... Just inevitably you always have a bell curve of  customers of how innovative or how leaning into the future they are versus how conservative  they are.

这是一个非常简单的想法，但它只是在追求这样一个事实：每年都有数十亿美元花在你的电脑上或纸上的软件上。他们基本上可以驾驭移动的增长和移动的增长，在这种野外工作者的场景中，他们能够与之一起成长。他们完美地把握了好的时机，那是iPad发布几年后的事。现在，这些设备将开始出现在物理环境中。我们需要做什么软件才能让建筑团队和建筑公司能够使用这种技术？真的要确保你会从一个主要的顺风中得到很大的好处，不要为自己制造不必要的逆风。在一个完美的世界里，你的产品应该真正地自我推销。这也是当你出去为企业建设的时候，你本能地没有想我怎样才能让这个产品成为病毒式的应用。因为我们已经习惯了建立销售团队和建立所有的客户关系，这些关系仍然很重要，因为你仍然需要用销售来最终与客户达成大的交易，但要确保产品本身是可以被采用、传播和使用的，而不受最终用户的任何摩擦。销售实际上应该被用来达成重大交易，而不是推动产品的采用，这在传统的企业软件世界中是一个很大的区别，在传统的企业软件世界中，销售是推动产品采用进入公司的唯一途径。我们非常重视我们在Box中的所有共享功能。当您有一个您想要共享的文档时，我们希望能够非常简单地共享这些文件。然后，软件就会传播开来，而不是像传统的企业软件供应商那样，不断地把它卖给公司。然后你用销售来完成更大的交易，帮助你在客户环境中导航。今天的松弛是病毒企业软件产品的一个完美的典型例子，在这种情况下，服务的使用就是传播到其他人，因为根据定义，您是在与其他人进行通信。他们真的做得非常好，这是确保你是建立一个产品，是尽可能容易采用和病毒。关于该产品的每一件事都会被调整，以便最终用户能够被授权自己传播它，这样他们就可以建立自己的病毒分销渠道。然后再进行销售，然后您可以向该企业出售额外的服务或功能。你真的想要在产品的采用和销售之间有一个分叉，确保你在做更大的交易。保佑你。好的。下一个。花时间，花大量的时间，与你的未来派客户在一起，但不要仅仅建立他们想要的东西。当你为企业而建的时候，你会有.不可避免的是，你总是会有一条顾客的钟形曲线，说明他们是如何创新的，他们是如何倾向于未来的，而不是他们是多么保守。

It's the customers that are at the first 5 to 10% of that  bell curve. They're at the bleeding edge of everything. They wait in line and they  get the AirPods and they have an Amazon Alexa at their desk in their office.  These are the customers that you want to spend a lot of time with because  they're going to see things even before you will about how your technology could be  used in their environment. They're going to spot trends of what's happening in their employee  base and how they want to push your technology farther than you even would have  imagined would have been possible. The amount of sort of innovation that we've been able  to drive because of what we've heard from those customers is probably a significant percentage  of what we've ended up building. The difference is from legacy enterprise software companies to  today is back in the day what you would do is you would just ask  them what do you want us to build and then you go build those things  because that would essentially lead to a sale or an upsell. What you need to  do is listen to what are the issues that they're seeing. What are the things  they wish your product could do. Then either work with them or come back with  solutions that maybe aren't exactly what they asked for. Maybe they aren't the specific features  that they ask for, but are going to eventually get them down the path that  really they're trying to push your product then. We spend a lot of time listening  to customers, but not building exactly what they ask for. Because when you just build  what a customer asks for, essentially you become this sort of amalgamation of feature request  from every single one of your customers. There's no way that you're going to then  be able to keep a consistent north star with your product. You're going to be  sort of pulled and locked to different directions by lots of different customers. The software  vendors that do it really wrong is by not listening at all to those early  adopters. They start focusing on the most conservative companies. They start focusing on the people  that will only adopt if they build all of the features that they ask for.  That's really how you go wrong in enterprise software because then you really lose sight  of your vision and ultimately what you're trying to build. We have a bunch of  different groups that we work with to try and learn all of the things that  the customer would want. We have lots of advisory boards and we're getting lists of  hundreds and hundreds of requests, but we don't just go and build whatever those requests  are. We spend a lot of time thinking about how can we connect the dots  between multiple requests or multiple ideas to build the solution that people didn't really even  think about previously. Also another area where software companies go wrong is you're going to  get a lot of requests from customers that are sort of contradictory in nature. Somebody  in financial services is going to say, "I want this functionality for my bank." Then  somebody in life science is going to say, "I want this functionality for my pharmaceutical  company." You're not going to be able to kind of like actually synchronize those requests,  the fundamentally required different user experiences, different product functionality. Where a lot of stuff where  companies go wrong is you start to build all these features in isolation. Then you  zoom out five years later and you've just built this massive technology that has like  okay, we've got this vertical offering for that industry. Then we've got a separate vertical  offering for that industry. You can learn a lot from companies like Salesforce which essentially  said, "Okay. We're going to build these modular components that can be mixed and matched  to create user experiences for different industries, for different lines of business, for different job  functions. We're not going to bake in all of the functionality directly into the product.  We're going to give customers the tools or even our own team to do that  customization themselves." A lot of companies get into a trap where you just are mindlessly  building lots of features. You zoom out a few years later and what you have  is this mess of serving a whole bunch of different industries with a really, really  bad user experience. The thing that we still stayed true to today and this is  where ... This one gets harder and harder over time especially as the deals get  bigger and bigger is making sure that at any juncture you're not ever trading off  the user experience for some enterprise feature or some feature that's going to get you  a bigger deal. There's going to be hundreds of times where you're at this moment  where the customer is asking for something that is antithetical or going to go against  the simplicity of that user experience. Maybe it's a security feature. Maybe it's a compliance  feature. Maybe it's something that they're just trying to put in the way of the  end user. Every single one of those decision points we have made sure that we  always favor the end user over the enterprise.

是顾客在钟形曲线的前5%到10%。他们处在每件事的边缘。他们排队等候，他们得到了Airpods，他们在办公室的办公桌上有一个亚马逊alexa。这些是你想花很多时间和他们在一起的客户，因为他们甚至在你之前就会看到一些关于如何在他们的环境中使用你的技术的东西。他们会发现他们员工基础上正在发生的事情的趋势，以及他们想要把你的技术推向比你想象的更远的方向，这是可能的。因为我们从这些客户那里听到的信息，我们能够推动的创新的数量可能是我们最终建立起来的很大一部分。区别在于，从传统的企业软件公司到今天的今天，你要做的就是问他们你想要我们做什么，然后你去构建这些东西，因为这基本上会导致销售或升级换代。你需要做的是倾听他们所看到的问题。他们希望你的产品能做些什么。然后要么和他们一起工作，要么回来拿出他们所要求的解决方案。也许它们不是他们所要求的具体特性，但最终会让他们走上他们真正想要推动你的产品的道路。我们花了很多时间倾听客户的意见，但并没有完全满足他们的要求。因为当您只是构建客户所要求的内容时，本质上您就变成了来自每个客户的特性请求的融合。你不可能让你的产品保持一致的北极星。你会被很多不同的顾客拉着，被锁在不同的方向上。真正做错了的软件供应商根本不听那些早期采用者的话。他们开始关注最保守的公司。他们开始关注那些只有在构建他们所要求的所有功能时才会采用的人。这就是你在企业软件中出错的原因，因为这样你就会忽略你的愿景，最终会忽略你想要构建的东西。我们有一群不同的团队，我们一起努力学习客户想要的所有东西。我们有很多咨询委员会，我们得到了数以百计的请求清单，但是我们不只是去构建那些请求。我们花了很多时间思考如何将多个请求或多个想法之间的点连接起来，从而构建人们以前根本没有想过的解决方案。另外，软件公司出错的另一个领域是，你会收到很多客户的请求，这些请求在本质上是矛盾的。金融服务部门的人会说，“我想为我的银行提供这个功能。”然后生命科学的某个人会说，“我想为我的制药公司提供这种功能。”您将无法真正同步这些请求，基本需要不同的用户体验，不同的产品功能。很多公司出错的地方就是你开始孤立地构建所有这些特性。五年后，你又缩小了，你刚刚建立了一项巨大的技术，我们已经为这个行业提供了一个垂直的产品。然后我们为这个行业提供了一个单独的垂直产品。你可以从Salesforce这样的公司学到很多东西。Salesforce本质上说：“好的。我们将构建这些可以混合和匹配的模块化组件，为不同的行业、不同的业务领域和不同的工作功能创建用户体验。我们不会把所有的功能直接放入产品中。我们将为客户提供工具，甚至是我们自己的团队，让他们自己进行定制。“许多公司陷入了一个陷阱，在那里你只是在盲目地构建许多特性。几年后，你就缩小了，而你所拥有的却是为一大群不同行业服务的烂摊子，他们的用户体验非常糟糕。我们一直坚持到今天，这就是.随着时间的推移，这件事变得越来越难，尤其是当交易越来越大的时候，你要确保在任何时候，你都不会用户体验来换取某个企业特性或一些能给你带来更大交易的功能。在这种情况下，客户要求的东西是对立的，或者与用户体验的简单性背道而驰。也许这是个安全功能。也许这是一个遵从性的特性。也许这是他们试图阻止最终用户使用的东西。这些决策点中的每一个，我们都确保我们总是偏爱最终用户而不是企业。

In some cases that means that we  will lose deals. We'll have to say no to a customer because by building that  feature, we don't think we're going to be able to deliver the delight and the  user experience that we're looking for over time. That gets really, really painful because you  lose then deals all throughout the years.

在某些情况下，这意味着我们将失去交易。我们将不得不拒绝一个客户，因为通过构建该功能，我们认为我们将无法提供喜悦和用户体验，随着时间的推移，我们正在寻找。这会变得非常痛苦，因为你输了之后，所有的交易都在这些年里。

If I look back over the past 10  years, we've lost tens of millions of dollars of business because we said no to  certain customers. What we benefited from though was a product that many, many years later  could serve a much wider population of customers. Then ended up making our existing customers  much more successful with our product. Funny enough the companies that once didn't say yes  to us and took their business somewhere else ended up being unsuccessful with those products  and had to eventually come back to us.

回顾过去的十年，我们失去了数千万美元的生意，因为我们拒绝了某些客户。不过，我们从中受益的是一种产品，许多很多年后，它可以为更广泛的客户提供服务。最终使我们现有的客户在我们的产品上获得更大的成功。有趣的是，那些曾经没有对我们说“是”并把业务转移到其他地方的公司最终在这些产品上失败了，最终不得不回到我们身边。

If you're right and the key point  here is you have to be right, if you're right and that user trade-off truly  was going to be disastrous for that user experience and you remain true to that  north star of always focusing on the user, eventually over the long run and long  run can be defined whatever your market is in, you will end up winning in  that market over the long run, but you're going to lose deals along the way.  That's going to be really stressful for you, for your team, for investors, but it's  really important that you're crystal clear on the principles of how you're building your product  and what you're going to say no to. Finally, find ways and this goes back  to that technology trend thing, but try and find ways where you can have asymmetrical  or asymmetric advantages over the competitors. What you'll find is that your competitors, the big  incumbents, can be locked in pretty significantly to particular business models because they in some  cases have tens of thousands of employees that are built up to build and to  deliver products in a very specific way.

如果你是对的，关键是你必须是对的，如果你是对的，而且那个用户交换真的会给用户体验带来灾难性的后果，而你仍然忠于那颗始终专注于用户的北极星，最终从长远和长远来看，无论你的市场在哪里，你最终都会获胜。从长远来看，在这个市场上，你会失去交易。这对你，对你的团队，对投资者来说都是很有压力的，但非常重要的是，你要非常清楚你是如何构建你的产品的原则，以及你要拒绝什么。最后，找到方法，这可以追溯到技术趋势，但是尝试着找出与竞争对手相比，你可以拥有不对称或不对称优势的方法。你会发现，你的竞争对手-大的现任者-可以非常明显地锁定特定的商业模式，因为在某些情况下，他们有数以万计的员工，这些员工是为了以一种非常具体的方式生产和交付产品而建立起来的。

If you can find points of differentiation and  a disruption that they can't respond to because either it is too expensive for them  to respond to or strategically it doesn't make as much sense for them to respond  or they don't have maybe the talent to respond to it, that is how you  ultimately remain disruptive to these bigger companies.

如果你能找到他们无法应对的分化和干扰点，因为对他们来说，要么应对成本太高，要么从战略角度看，他们的反应就没有那么有意义了，或者他们可能没有应对的天赋，这就是为什么你最终仍会对这些大公司产生破坏性影响。

It's the only way to survive as a  small startup. Amazon Web Services, we take it for granted now how easily you can  build a company just by writing some code and deploy it on the AWS. 10  years ago, 15 years ago, what you had to do is you had to buy  all these servers. You had to put them in data centers. You had to wrap  them yourselves. You had to connect them all together and that will take weeks or  months and cost in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars just to get your  startup going. That's the benefit to us as building software companies. Think about now the  difference if you're one of the vendors that built that hardware and you sold those  servers and you sold that data center space. Think about how disruptive Amazon Web Services  was coming out of nowhere and having a completely different model where now I don't  have to buy servers anymore because I can just go to Amazon. Amazon did something  that was so disruptive to the core business model of traditional server makers and software  providers that literally those companies to this day have not even responded. 12 years later  they still have not responded by being to deliver these capabilities over the cloud because  of how disruptive it is from a business model standpoint. Really try and identify are  there things from a product standpoint that could be highly disruptive to how your product  can be delivered to clients versus how incumbent solutions were delivered.

作为一家小型初创企业，这是唯一的生存方式。亚马逊网络服务，我们认为它是理所当然的，现在你可以轻松地建立一个公司，只需编写一些代码，并将其部署到AWS上。10年前，15年前，你要做的就是买下所有这些服务器。你必须把它们放在数据中心。你得自己包起来。你必须把它们连接在一起，这需要几个星期或几个月的时间，在某些情况下需要花费几十万美元才能启动。这对我们建设软件公司是有益的。现在想一想，如果你是制造硬件的厂商之一，你卖了那些服务器，你卖掉了数据中心的空间，那就有什么区别了。想想亚马逊网络服务(AmazonWebServices)是多么的颠覆性，它有着完全不同的模式，现在我不再需要购买服务器了，因为我可以直接去亚马逊。亚马逊所做的事情对传统服务器制造商和软件提供商的核心商业模式造成了如此大的破坏，以至于这些公司至今都没有做出回应。12年后，由于从业务模型的角度来看，这些功能具有多大的破坏性，他们至今还没有通过云交付这些功能。从产品的角度来看，是否有可能对如何将产品交付给客户，以及如何交付现有的解决方案，产生很大的干扰。

I kind of wrap  all of this up with a Steve Jobs quote.

我用史蒂夫·乔布斯(SteveJobs)的话来概括这一切。

It's a requirement that you have  a Steve Jobs quote in any product presentation so I need to meet that quota.  This is really true and it's especially true in enterprise.

这是一个要求，你有一个史蒂夫乔布斯的报价在任何产品介绍，所以我需要达到这个配额。这是真的，尤其是在企业中。

It's like really true in  consumer, but it's like even more true in enterprise software because what happens is enterprises  are just asking for solutions to all their problems.

这在消费者中是真的，但在企业软件中更是如此，因为企业只是要求解决他们所有的问题。

In many cases they don't know  what the right solution is until you come out of nowhere with something they never  would be possible.

在许多情况下，他们不知道什么是正确的解决方案，直到你从不知道什么东西，他们永远不可能。

In our case, just in our product, literally if you took 100  IT people from 100 different companies 12 years ago and you said, "Draw out the  best way for your company to manage documents, manage files, secure their information," not in  100 attempts would our solution have been sort of designed because everybody was so used  to the technology has to be really complex, it has to have these interface buttons,  it has to have all these features for it to make sense. We came in  with a product that nobody would have anticipated because of how dead simple it was.  You can't really go ask your customers just like, "Hey, what do you want us  to do," and then somehow you're going to end up with a really great solution.  You have to really think hard about what is possible in the feature, what are  the things that maybe your customers aren't anticipating and you have to build that. Then  essentially have that land inside of the customer base. Really make sure that you're not  just building what customers are asking for because no great technology has been built that  way. Last thing that I'll leave you with, it's my ...

在我们的产品中，如果你12年前从100家不同的公司吸收了100名IT人员，你说：“找出最好的方法，让你的公司管理文件，保护他们的信息。”如果不是在100次尝试中，我们的解决方案都是设计出来的，因为每个人都习惯了这项技术，所以必须非常复杂，它必须有这些界面按钮，它必须具备所有这些特性才有意义。我们带来了一个没有人会预料到的产品，因为它非常简单。你不能问你的客户，就像“嘿，你想让我们做什么”，然后你会得到一个非常好的解决方案。您必须认真考虑功能中的哪些内容是可能的，哪些是您的客户可能没有预料到的东西，而您必须构建这些功能。从本质上说，这片土地就在客户群的内部。确实要确保你不仅仅是在构建客户所要求的东西，因为没有以这种方式构建的伟大技术。我留给你的最后一件事，是我的.

I think they're my  four favorite books on building B2B stuff. Don't hold me to me, but here are  four good books that I would highly recommend reading if you're going to build a  B2B software company.

我想这是我最喜欢的四本关于建立B2B东西的书。不要抱着我，但是这里有四本好书，如果你想要建立一个B2B软件公司，我会强烈推荐你去读。

It gets you into the mindset and have the frame of reference  of how to think about growth, disruption, building a new market and then ultimately going  out and building a company that can scale in the space.

它让你进入了思维模式，并有了如何思考增长、破坏、建立新市场、最终走出市场、建立一家能够在太空中扩张的公司的参考框架。

If I had read  these four books 12 years ago, I think we would have not had to learn  these lessons so slowly.

如果我在12年前读过这四本书，我想我们就不必这么慢地学习这些课程了。

I would highly recommend checking these out. With that, I would  just say good luck. Please do not compete with me.

我强烈建议你去看看这些。有了这个，我只能说祝你好运。请不要和我竞争。

I don't need more competition.  Do not use my advice against me in any way. Hope to see you in  the market. Take care. Okay.

我不需要更多的竞争。不要以任何方式利用我的建议。希望在市场上见到你。保重!好的。

I don't know what happens next, but ...

我不知道接下来会发生什么，但是.

I have  time.

我有时间。

I have like five minutes, but I don't know how it works with people.  Okay. All right.

我有五分钟的时间，但我不知道如何与人相处。好的。好的

I can answer questions or you can leave. Either way. Okay. Yes?
Audience: What are some ways that you would actually suggest because similar to you when you  were actually back in school, you may not have had the chance to work in  other startup companies.

我可以回答问题，你也可以离开。不管怎样。好的。是观众：你会有什么建议，因为当你回到学校的时候，你可能没有机会在其他的创业公司工作。

I want to know your take on that.

我想知道你对此的看法。

Aaron Levie: It's hard because I haven't had to do what you're asking which is ... Then  the question was how do you discover issues that enterprises are having without necessarily working  inside the enterprise.

亚伦·列维：这很难，因为我还没有按照你的要求去做，那就是.接下来的问题是，如何发现企业在企业内部不一定工作的问题。

I think one is spend a lot of time with people that  everyday they're going into the office and they're running into all these problems and I  would just go interview like a hundred people. Just like, "Walk me through your day.  What are all the places where you are less effective, less efficient? Having to do  repetitive or redundant work?" Don't ask for technology problems. Just listen to where they're spending  their time and what processes do they keep repeating over and over again. Then you  can start to imagine well, how could software go and attack that problem? How could  software attack the problem of meeting scheduling? Not a big market, but one space. How  could software attack the problem of payroll? How could software attack the problem of expense  reporting? All of these kind of things are the drudgery of working inside of a  big company.

我想其中之一就是花很多时间和人们在一起，他们每天都去办公室，他们遇到了所有这些问题，我就像去面试一百个人一样。就像，“让我过完你的一天。在哪些地方你效率不高，效率不高？必须做重复或多余的工作？”不要问技术问题。只要听一听他们在哪里消磨时间，以及他们一遍又一遍地重复着什么过程。然后你就可以开始想象，软件怎么才能解决这个问题呢？软件如何解决会议调度问题？不是一个大市场，而是一个空间。软件如何解决工资问题？软件如何解决费用报告问题？所有这些事情都是在大公司里工作的苦差事。

If you haven't worked in one of those big companies, you at least  have to get as much information as you can from people that do work in  those big companies. Then you can start to see partners of like okay, this seems  like a really big problem.

如果你没有在一家大公司工作过，你至少要从那些大公司工作的人那里获得尽可能多的信息。然后你可以开始看到像这样的伙伴，这似乎是一个很大的问题。

In our case if you had interviewed clients or people  that worked in big enterprises 15 years ago and you said, "Walk me through your  day," I think you would have eventually spotted how much time is wasted when people  are working with their documents and they're trying to share their documents and they're trying  to access their documents from different devices.

在我们的例子中，如果你在15年前采访过那些在大企业工作的客户或人员，你会说，“让我走过你的一天”，我想你最终会发现，当人们在处理他们的文档时，他们试图共享他们的文档，并试图从不同的设备上访问他们的文档，你最终会发现浪费了多少时间。

If you really peel that apart and you  ask all the right questions, you would have actually discovered this problem. We discovered it  because of what we were doing in our personal lives in college, but you would  have also discovered it by just understanding where people are spending time in the workplace  and then saying, "Hey, wait a second. That doesn't make sense because technology today could  solve that problem way better than what they're getting as solutions." As soon as you  find that gap, that's where you can build the company.

如果你真的剥开了它，问了所有正确的问题，你就会发现这个问题。我们发现它是因为我们在大学的私生活中所做的事情，但你也可以通过了解人们在工作场所的时间，然后说，“嘿，等等。这是没有道理的，因为今天的科技可以比他们作为解决方案得到的更好地解决这个问题。”一旦你发现了这个差距，你就可以在那里建立公司。

Audience: Thank you.

观众：谢谢。

Aaron Levie: Yeah.

亚伦·列维：是的。

Audience: I was wondering like you mentioned about riding the tech wave.

观众：我想知道，就像你提到的，骑科技浪潮。

In your opinion, what  do you think is the biggest tech wave now?
Aaron Levie: Well, it's not Bitcoin. Sorry to all the Bitcoin startups. Bitcoin could be up in  the top five or something, but I don't want to offend all the Bitcoin people.  I'm going to get like hate mail. Can we edit that part out about my  attack on Bitcoin? I'm going to say a bunch of the trends.

在你看来，你认为现在最大的科技浪潮是什么？亚伦·列维：嗯，这不是比特币。很抱歉所有的比特币初创公司。比特币可能是前五名，但我不想冒犯所有比特币的人。我会像收到仇恨邮件一样。我们能把关于我攻击比特币的那部分删掉吗？我要说的是一系列的趋势。

I don't know  how to rank order them, but obviously AR/VR is a big one.

我不知道如何排序，但很明显，AR/VR是一个很大的排序。

I think AR/VR  is in a challenging spot because we don't have ubiquitous devices yet. The question is  is AR/VR like mobile was 12 years ago or is it still another five years  away? The last thing you want to do is be the mobile startup of 2001  because those startups died.

我认为AR/VR是一个充满挑战的地方，因为我们还没有无处不在的设备。问题是，AR/VR是像12年前的移动设备，还是再过五年？你最不想做的就是2001年的移动创业，因为那些初创公司都死了。

It's actually really hard to predict these things.

实际上很难预测这些事情。

I don't have  any advice on how do you predict if it's actually going to happen or not,  but there was a bunch of mobile companies and funny enough, Sam Altman would have  good stories around this back in like 2004 building a mobile company and how hard  it was because you didn't have the iPhone. Before the iPhone, it really sucked being  in mobile. That's kind of the state of things right now if you're building AR/VR  which is like we know this is probably the future. We don't know if we're  looking at the right era of it yet. That will be the one caveat I  just say.

我没有任何建议，你如何预测它是否真的会发生，但有一群移动公司和足够有趣的是，山姆奥尔特曼会有很好的故事，在2004年建立一个移动公司，这是多么困难，因为你没有iPhone。在iPhone问世之前，它真的让手机陷入了困境。这是一种现在的状态，如果你正在构建AR/VR，就好像我们知道这可能是未来。我们还不知道我们是否在寻找正确的时代。这就是我要说的警告。

It's going to be the future we don't know exactly when. AI is  a massive tech trend.

这将是未来，我们不知道确切的时间。人工智能是一种巨大的科技潮流。

It doesn't necessary benefit though startups versus incumbents.

尽管初创企业与现任者相比，这并不一定会带来什么好处。

It's going to  be more pervasive than that.

它会比这更普遍。

I don't know how to necessarily use it as an  advantage over an incumbent because the incumbents are actually like almost superior in this technology  right now. Let's see.

我不知道如何把它作为比现任者更好的优势，因为现在的在任者在这项技术上几乎是优势所在。让我们看看。

I mean you can always expect the cost of computing is  just going to continue to drop. We thought that was a trend 12 years ago.  Well, it hasn't gone away and it's actually more powerful than ever before.

我的意思是，你总能预料到计算的成本会继续下降。我们认为这是12年前的一种趋势。嗯，它还没有消失，它实际上比以往任何时候都更强大。

I think  there's some pretty cool things like as an example and I might have to change  my own even definition of this of like thinking about the compounding of two trends.  For instance, AI and cheap computing together are actually the really powerful trend right now.  Google just launched this new service that does image recognition and video recognition, object recognition  inside of images and videos. Just via an API, you can send Google an image  or a video and it will tell you what's in that image or video. That  would have taken like a hundred engineers five years ago to go build that. Now  you get it as a simple API from Google. Thinking about wait a second, like  what happens when you have a bunch of these new services that are being created  on our behalf from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, et cetera? What's the new set of problems  that we could use those solutions and build software for? Maybe you build a company  that does security cameras that plugs into Google computer vision API. Maybe you build a  new way to navigate or search for images and data because of these APIs. There's  a lot of new problems that you wouldn't have even been able to see were  a problem before you knew that this technology was possible. Now you can start to  look at the world in a different way if you have complete understanding of what  all those APIs are that are out there now. Maybe the last question. Yeah?
Audience: I was wondering what's your opinion on a startup using other enterprise softwares on your  platform?
Aaron Levie: Like what's an example?
Audience: I guess like servers are pretty obvious to use, but like for instance like money  transactions, doing something for that and you have something specific that maybe could be built  versus like ...

我认为有一些很酷的东西，比如，作为一个例子，我可能不得不改变我自己对这一点的定义，比如思考两种趋势的复合。例如，人工智能和廉价计算结合在一起，实际上是目前真正强大的趋势。Google刚刚推出了一项新的服务，它可以进行图像识别和视频识别，以及图像和视频内部的对象识别。只要通过一个API，你可以发送一个图像或视频谷歌，它会告诉你什么是在该图像或视频。五年前，这需要大约一百名工程师来建造。现在，您可以从Google获得一个简单的API。想一想等一下，比如当你有一堆新的服务正在由Google，Amazon，Microsoft等为我们创建的时候会发生什么呢？我们可以使用这些解决方案并构建软件的新问题集是什么？也许你会建立一家公司，该公司生产的安全摄像头可以插入谷歌的电脑视觉API。也许您构建了一种新的方式来导航或搜索图像和数据，因为这些API。有很多新的问题，在你知道这项技术是可能的之前，你甚至无法看到它是一个问题。现在，如果您完全了解了现在存在的所有这些API，您就可以开始以不同的方式看待这个世界了。也许是最后一个问题。嗯观众：我想知道你对一个在你平台上使用其他企业软件的创业公司有什么看法？亚伦·列维：比如什么？观众：我想服务器的使用是相当明显的，但就像金钱交易，为此做一些事情，你有一些特定的东西，也许可以被构建，而不是像…。

Aaron Levie: I think the question is sort of like when do you decide what to build  versus what to use other companies for and I think for us I generally believe  that anything that is not your core competency, you need to make sure that you're  using the best in class outside solution for. The moment that you realize I'm not  going to be the best company at payments, you better be using Stripe or something  else for that problem. You shouldn't be building that yourself. The last thing you want  to do is spend anytime as a company building out things that the market is  going to solve better than you will and make sure that you are extremely clear  on your core competency.

亚伦·列维：我认为问题就像你什么时候决定要建什么，而不是用其他公司做什么。我认为，对于我们来说，我一般认为，任何不是你核心竞争力的东西，你都需要确保你在课堂上使用最好的解决方案。当你意识到我不是最好的支付公司的时候，你最好用Stripe或者别的什么来解决这个问题。你不应该自己建造的。你最不想做的事情就是在任何时候作为一家公司，打造出市场会比你更好地解决的问题，并确保你的核心竞争力非常清晰。

I think this is actually where startups go sort of the  wrong way a lot of times is not getting crystal clear on what is the  thing that we can do that the market is not going to go and build  and commoditize. What's interesting and we've learned this over the years is that's not a  static definition. The market is always changing. Your core competency might actually be changing every  couple of years because you have to adapt with the realities of the market.

我认为这实际上是初创企业走错了路的地方-很多时候，我们不清楚我们能做什么-市场不会去建造和商品化的有趣的是，我们多年来学到了这一点，那不是一个静态的定义。市场总是在变化。你的核心竞争力可能每隔几年就会改变一次，因为你必须适应市场的实际情况。

If  I go back 10 years ago or 12 years ago, we had that picture of  the four of us, we would go into data centers and we were building out  our own storage infrastructure. We knew that it sucked that we were building out our  own storage infrastructure because we knew somebody else could be doing this better than us,  but there was no other solution. Fast forward to today, we have no problem using  Amazon for all of that. We have no illusion that that is somehow a point  of differentiation or value for us. The moment that the rest of the market catches  up and commoditizes something that you you used to be good at, you need to  get away from that part of the market as fast as possible. Cool. All right.  I got to jump. Good luck guys. Take care.


如果我回到10年前或者12年前，我们有我们四个人的照片，我们会进入数据中心，我们正在建立我们自己的存储基础设施。我们知道我们正在建设自己的存储基础设施，因为我们知道其他人会比我们做得更好，但没有其他解决方案。快到今天，我们在所有这一切上使用亚马逊都是没有问题的。我们没有幻想，这对我们来说是一个分化点或价值点。当市场的其他部分赶上并商品化你曾经擅长的东西的时候，你需要尽快摆脱市场的那一部分。凉爽的好的我得跳了。祝各位好运。保重!
