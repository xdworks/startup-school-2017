# How to Build a Product II

Aaron Levie: How's everybody doing? Is everybody really pumped up to talk about enterprise software? Good. That's  what you want to do today. I'm Aaron Levie, CEO, co-founder of Box. What I  wanted to do was share a little bit about our story at Box and how  we started building our company. We actually didn't start as an enterprise software company. We  eventually changed our business model and our path. I want to talk a little bit  how we got to that decision and how we started building up our product and  our company. I really hope this is true. If many of you go out and  build enterprise software companies, maybe there's some lessons that we've learned that took us a  long time to learn that maybe you can learn a little bit faster because of  some of the things that we've gone through. I think with some time we can  open up for questions or what not. Is that all cool? We good with that?  Okay. This is going to be highly interactive. We got to like talk to each  other. You know what I'm saying? I love it when the least interactive part is  when I call out that we need to be interactive, but okay. Here's how we  have been building for the modern enterprise and maybe some lessons that you can take  with you. We started box in 2005. We were actually sophomores and freshmen in college  at the time when the idea got started. This was about 12 years ago. What  was happening was everywhere that we were working from, everywhere that we were trying to  access files from, everywhere that we were trying to share ... Anybody we were trying  to share data with, it was just way too hard to do this. We had  to have these USB thumb drives. Hopefully you've never had to use one before. If  you have USB thumb drives, you're emailing yourself files. You have FTP accounts and it  was just way too complicated for just getting daily work done. Just way too slow,  too cumbersome. At the time I actually did an internship with a company that also  use enterprise software for sharing and collaborating and managing content. That technology was also way  too complicated and complex. Really we got the idea in kind of late 2004. What  was happening was we saw this confluence of major technology trends that we felt could  go and solve this problem of why is it so hard just to share files  and get work done with other people. We saw that there would be a handful  of major technology trends that could ultimately solve this problem of working with our information,  working with our data from anywhere. The big three though that we focused in on  were the ... The first was mobile ubiquity. Now obviously this is a standard trend.  No software company would start without a mobile strategy. Back in 2004 and 2005 it  wasn't the case, but we had this vision and we had this foresight where we  thought back in 2004 and 2005 that over the next decade the entire planet would  start to be using Blackberry's everywhere. That was our vision. We were wrong fortunately. We  got better devices, but we knew that mobile was certainly going to be a really  powerful opportunity in the future. It was going to change the way people worked with  information. We're glad that it ended up being a little bit of a better platform.  We also saw this trend of the cost of computing and the cost of storage  was dropping pretty rapidly. It wasn't called cloud computing at the time, but you could  see that there was this ability to buy lots and lots of infrastructure at scale,  centralized it in one place and then be able to build applications on it over  the internet. We sort of figure why is it that people are going out and  building their own infrastructure and their own data center when a software provider could do  this all themselves and get the economies to scale to serve lots and lots of  customers with that technology. We said okay, at some point in time computing is going  to reach this point where it's really, really cheap and inexpensive for anybody and so  that's what should be in the cloud. Then finally, we figured that as more and  more people were connected to the internet, as more and more people in businesses were  working on mobile devices and collaborating more and more that we'd become much more interconnected.  Businesses that once had to have all of their own people and infrastructure and competencies  within their own organization would eventually be able to be networked with partners and clients  and vendors and colleagues all around the world and be able to get value from  everyone which would mean that you'd need software that would be better at letting us  interact with one another over the internet as opposed to just people with our own  corporate network which is where our market had traditionally kind of been focused on. We  took these three big trends, everybody on the internet, everybody on mobile, and really, really  cheap computing and storage. We said what would we design if those conditions were true  in the future? What would be design to build a really, really simple way for  people to share files and securely access their information? We launched this thing. It was  actually called Box.net at the time. We launched the site and the idea was really  simple. You could upload your files and you can access them from any web browser,  any mobile device. Within a few months of launching, thousands of people were signing up  for it. We had worked on some mechanics to make sure that was as simple  as possible, so we had way easier sign up flow. It was just focused on  the end users. In traditional IT environments you usually had to go to corporate IT  or you had to go to corporate security to be able to get access to  technology. We just let anybody sign up with their own information, their own email address  which was actually pretty disruptive at the time to traditional IT. Anybody could go online.  They could get a couple gigabytes of storage space and be able to share and  access their information from anywhere. That was the original idea. What we sort of ultimately  realized that we actually had no clue about it because we were just in college  at the time was that enterprises all around the world and companies of all sizes  were just used to really, really bad technology. The bar was just really, really low  for what you could do to ... Our first application was pretty horrendous, but the  bar was so low that all you had to do was solve some basic problems  and then end users within those IT environments, within those enterprises would all of a  sudden want to adopt your technology. What we discovered was that people all around the  world and companies of all sizes whether it was a Fortune 500 company that was  spending hundreds of millions of dollars on technology or small businesses, everybody had this interest  and demand for really, really simple tools. One of our competitors at the time, the  primary product you had to use for sharing information looked a little something like this.  This is a screen shot from one of the products. It's a pretty horribly designed  technology. I don't know even what it says. It's just a screen grab from the  internet, but like really not elegant software for working with other people and collaborating. What  sort of started out for us as a really simple way to share files, it  was like that dead simple of a proposition, actually turned out that it was the  sort of crux of how people could be working in the future. It was a  much easier way for people to be able to work. We're getting a little security  prompt. Of course, that has to happen. Okay. What started out as a really simple  way to share files turned into this new way of working. We weren't trying to  solve this vast problem of how could companies work in a modern way. All we  were trying to do was build really simple technology that makes it easy for people  to share files and access information from anywhere. Then we eventually evolved the strategy. Things  were growing so quickly that we basically decided ... Like any classic startup story, we  decided to get in a minivan and drop out of college and move to the  Bay Area to go and build the company. There's always this part in the story  where if you kind of roll back in time ... This was us living and  working out of a renovated garage. That thing behind us is actually technically ... It's  actually zoned as a garage, but we were living out of it. It was actually  pretty illegal. The four founders just going out and we all dropped out of college  and building out this. What we didn't yet fully know was this enterprise software company  eventually would become a whole enterprise software platform. It's funny because when you're dropping out,  what you imagine, the glory of, "Okay. I'm leaving school. This is going to be  so glorious. Think about all the people that dropped out before us. You have Bill  Gates. Bill Gates dropped out. This is going to be so exciting. Then you've got  Steve Jobs. He dropped out. This is super exciting. Michael Dell dropped out. That's super  exciting, but nobody ever really remembers this guy." We always sort of think about the  glorious stories of dropping out. Actually I don't even know if this guy dropped out,  but it looks like he must have or had to do something. We were so  pumped. We're like, "We're dropping out of college. Fuck this. We're going to go start  a software company." We were in this position where we were living and working all  together and we were iterating on our business over and over again. We were pivoting  almost every single day. If you've ever done a startup, what you find is like  maybe every 24 hours you're sort of reflecting on your business model and your strategy  and is it going to work, do you think it's going to scale, are the  economics actually going to play out. We got to this juncture where we basically had  to say, "Do we want to be a company that serves consumers or do we  want to be a company that serves businesses?" The reason that we got to that  junction was we had consumers that were spending I think at the time I think  the most you could spend on our product was $9.99 a cents. Pretty standard consumer  software payment structure. It was about 10 bucks a month, but what we saw was  that companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and Microsoft eventually would be giving everybody  free storage on the internet and that you really wouldn't want to be spending money  for storage on the internet. Maybe just as a quick survey, who actually pays for  more storage in one of the storage solutions that you're using? Oh wow. Okay. All  right. You guys just create a lot of data or something? What's going on here?  All right. Okay. Who doesn't pay? Okay. Right. Not a great business model when you  only have about maybe 35% or so of the market that's willing to upgrade for  your solution. You want to be able to reach a broader population than that. What  we said was at some point Google, Facebook and others were going to give away  unlimited space and it was going to be really, really hard to upsell people over  time. That was on the consumer side. On the enterprise side though, what we realized  was actually companies were spending millions and millions of dollars on software that we thought  we could do with at a smaller amount of spend and for a fraction of  the price. Companies on one hand were spending millions or tens of millions of dollars  and we thought we could deliver it to them for maybe hundreds of thousands of  dollars. You could have almost a 10 or 20x improvement on sort of the cost  of the service. On the other hand we felt that at most we could charge  consumers maybe $10 per month and that would actually have downward pressure over time just  because of the economics of the space where storage is getting cheaper. It actually took  us a surprising amount of time to come to the conclusion that we needed to  go in the enterprise because we still were like well, yeah, but what if we  could serve advertising on the files or something? It just turns out you really don't  want to see ads when you're looking at your tax documents or your photos. We  didn't think that the advertising model was going to work for consumers, but we did  decide that actually if you could build really, really great enterprise software that could solve  all of the enterprise's problems around managing information and collaborating around files and you could  build one platform for being able to do that, that maybe you could actually compress  some of the economics in the market and be fairly disruptive to the traditional players.  We sort of stepped back and we said, "Okay. If we're going to do this,  are we really going to build an enterprise software company?" We were 23 and 22  at the time, the founding team, and we had a few other employees. There's like  a long list of things that you could do that aren't very cool. Somewhere near  the bottom of that list when you're 23 and 22 is starting an enterprise software  company. If you just had like a quadrant, like a McKenzie quadrant of like lamest  things possible to do, it's starting an enterprise software company. We were pretty sort of  distraught of this idea of like are we going to go and build a company  like an Oracle or an SAP or something? Is that really going to be fun  because think about what we think about. When I say the words enterprise and B2B,  what you should be thinking of if you have some experience in the space is  you should be thinking like okay, it's like slow companies that don't innovate quickly, the  technology is way too expensive, you're just selling to the buyer, you're not really selling  to the user, the technology itself is super complex. There's really no incentive structure to  make really simple enterprise software. The reason for that is that because the people who  have the budget don't actually have to deal with the complexity of the technology. They  don't actually prioritize simplicity and user experience when they're making buying decisions. You have to  deal with frustrating sales reps. If you're on the other end of buying enterprise software,  what ends up happening is you're just getting called all day long by sales reps  for software that you basically don't want. There's unfriendly policy terms. It's always terms of  services that favor the vendor, not favor the customer. The very structure of the contract  in this industry are totally not favorable to the client. Software design is pretty horrible  because again if you don't have a market that is prioritizing user experience or simplicity,  then you can't get the best designers because the best designers don't want to work  at companies that aren't building really simple software. Then what's the point of having great  design and so then the design ends up sucking. You get really infrequent updates. It  turns out when you sell to enterprises, this actually make sense. Enterprises want a lot  of predictability. They don't want their technology changing on them at the same rate that  Snapchat or Facebook is able to change their software for us. Because if I'm a  CIO, chief information officer, of a 20 or 50,000 person company and my software vendor  is changing all the time, that's going to make it so I have to go  retrain my employees. What that then means is that the software vendors don't want to  update their software and don't want to update their technology a lot because the customers  want it to be infrequently updated. That then slows down all of your innovation. Imagine  working at a company where you ship product updates maybe once a year or once  every three years, that's pretty annoying. You're not going to get the best innovation. You  have all this downtime just because it's just really creaky technology that always has these  weird problems that you run into, corrupted data. The list could be about five times  longer. If you were to make a list of like what words describe the enterprise  software industry, this is just getting started. If you kind of took it all together  and you rounded it all together basically like the picture that people have in their  head when you say enterprise software is basically like this, it's just your vendor just  being angry at you. Actually it looks a little bit more like this, it's a  little bit more pirate oriented. This is basically what enterprise software companies when they think  about enterprise technology vendors at least 10 years ago. We said okay, if we're going  to pivot the company and we're going to forego all the fun and all the  exciting times we would have as a consumer company, then we have to find a  way to build an enterprise software company that operates and acts and innovates and moves  like a consumer company. If we're going to forego the consumer side and serving just  consumers in their personal lives, we still have to find a way to build a  company that feels like a consumer company that just happens to sell to enterprises. Then  we made a list of basically what are the things that are changing in the  technology world that allow for you to build a company in a very different way.  This is I think what makes enterprise software so exciting for all of us today  which is why I think it might not be still the number one coolest thing  to do of all time, but it's at least in getting the top 300 options.  We said okay, if we're going to build a different enterprise software company, what is  true today? This is back in 2006 and 2007. What is true in 2006 and  7 that allows us to build a different kind of enterprise software company? Well, the  first is let's look at the old way. The old way was get really complex  technology. It was all about the sales. What's your distribution channel? You had to have  sales people as your primary way into getting you the customers because customers couldn't access  your technology on their own. They had to install it. To install it, you had  to have a sales person go out and try and pitch the customer that they  should start using it. All of your distribution was constrained by the number of sales  reps that you had. Technology was only available to the biggest companies. This ends up  being a pretty big flaw because if you're trying to go have a massive impact  on the world, but only the Fortune 500 can actually afford to use your technology  because nobody else has the infrastructure or the apparatus to be able to install the  technology, then really you're not having that big of an impact on the world. You're  just having a big impact on the top enterprises that are out there. We saw  a lot of flaws with how technology sort of solve the security problem. When you  buy enterprise software 10 years ago, you bought the infrastructure or the hardware, then you  bought software, then you bought security software to secure the software and the hardware. Bless  you. You had all of this technology that you had to have. Buy from lots  of different vendors and it was the customer's responsibility for putting it all together. That  meant that there was a lot of security vulnerability inside of those platforms. There's also  a thing where the customer is bearing the risks because what happens is the customer  is buying the licenses for the software upfront regardless of what they use. You have  this sort of assymetry where the vendor always wins because the customer is buying the  software in perpetuity essentially. Then what's happening is even if the software doesn't work for  them, the customers already paid. You see all the time you'd have these software projects  that enterprises would have where they've spent $10 million on software and they'd never install  it because it wasn't what they wanted and there's no recourse. Once they bought it,  they can't do anything about it. Pretty fundamental broken business model. Then finally, the platforms  themselves were fairly proprietary. They were closed systems. They weren't integrated and open to other  platforms. It was very proprietary technology. We said well, what if there's a new version  of each of these things? What if you can make it so the technology was  simple and elegant and we always focused on the end user and we never lost  sight of the power of the end user? What if the product was actually pulled  into organizations by those end users, as opposed to you having to only do top  down sales? What if the software was so good and so freely available that anyone  could bring it into the workplace on their own? What if it was available to  people inside of organizations of all sizes? What if it could be a small business  anywhere around the world? What if it could be a large enterprise? What if it  could be a three person startup? How could you make that technology available to anybody  of all size? How could you make sure that security was baked in so the  customer doesn't have to buy all this other technology and wrap it around these tools?  What if the vendor could bear more of the risk? If you're a customer of  ours and the technology's not working, you're not going to renew. What if more of  that risk to making sure you're successful is actually something that the vendor has to  focus on? Then finally, what if you had open systems? What if you connected to  all the different enterprise software that people were using and you didn't have a closed  platform that locked in data? We kind of said okay, there's this old way that  the Oracles of the world built their technology and then there's a new way. What  if we could go describe each of these new things that was different about technology  today and go build an enterprise software company that really solved this core set of  issues? That's essentially what we've been working on for the past decade. We said here  are the new conditions of this landscape. Let's build a software company for the enterprise  that is built and operates like a consumer company. That's been our strategy since about  2007. Fortunately what's cool is that it has played out in favor of a lot  of the things that we've been talking about that we identified. We now have about  71,000 customers. We're about 63% of the Fortune 500. This was generated mostly because people  just at work wanted to bring in better technology and then we eventually were able  to sell to the broader organization, but it was really about solving for that user,  pulling the technology into the workplace and then ultimately solving a bunch of problems from  there. The exciting thing about what has played out in the cloud is that you  have companies of all sizes and in all industries that are now transforming the way  they work because of the cloud. We can work with companies as wide ranging as  Pixar where they use Box to be able to share and collaborate around movies, to  Nike where they use Box for product and marketing, all the way Eli Lilly where  you have things like R&D and drug discover and various kind of medical discoveries happening  and collaborating around through Box as well. What's cool is it doesn't matter the industry.  Companies of all sizes have realized all of this potential for moving to the cloud.  We are one of many companies that are benefiting from this set of trends. The  cool thing I think for all of us and for anybody starting a company in  this space is that really this is just the beginning of a whole significant change  in this industry. Going back 10 years, I thought it was the beginning, but it  was still a pretty slow start to kind of get to where we are today.  If I look at all of the trends that are happening in the enterprise, I  think the best opportunities are actually yet to come. This means that there's going to  be more growth and more opportunity than ever before. The reason for this is basically  you have two big factors. First is most of the technologies still used by enterprises  is still that legacy technology. It's still old. It's slow. It's complex. It's expensive. It's  sold by the legacy vendors. On one hand, you just have this gigantic market of  old stuff that is going to have to get retired, shut down and moved to  the cloud. That's the first thing. The other trend is that every business on the  planet is recognizing that that legacy technology is not going to let them transform their  business models, the way that they serve their customers, the way that they operate. You're  probably familiar with the fact that every single company on the planet at this point  knows they need to modernize their organization in some significant way. If you're a media  company, you're freaking out because of Netflix. If you're a life sciences company, you're freaking  out because of 23andMe. If you're a financial services company, you're freaking out because of  Stripe. If you're a hospitality company, you're freaking out because of Airbnb. Every single company  in every single industry recognizes that you have all of these disruptive forces coming from  the digital industries and Silicon Valley and broader than Silicon Valley and that every single  company is going to have to operate and upgrade both the technology that they use  as well as the sort of business models that they have. What's cool is if  you're building for enterprises, that means there's an unbelievable amount of opportunity because all of  those companies, all the Fortune 500 and all the other companies that need to be  transforming are going to need modern software to be able to work and operate in  this new way. They're going to need new technology that allows them to be able  to actually compete effectively with the digital economy. That means for all of us that  there's more opportunity than ever before. Because if I go back 10 years ago, there  wasn't actually a significant catalyst for enterprises to go upgrade their IT systems and their  technology systems. Today that catalyst is just the fact that every company is being disrupted  in sort of every single that they look at the market. That just means that  you have this catalyst which is if I am General Electric or I'm a Walmart  or I'm a Procter & Gamble, I need to be working with startups and new  suppliers that are going to make more effective and more competitive which means that then  there's opportunity if you're building for B2B. If I can convince you to build an  enterprise software company, here are some lessons that we have learned. A lot of these  actually apply probably for most markets. They're ones that we have specifically taken from building  for the B2B market, but certainly a lot of these apply whether you're building a  consumer app or a medical device company or any kind of entrepreneurial activity. Here are  I think eight lessons that we've taken from our journey and a few that I've  learned from other companies over the years as well that I'll try and weave in.  Some of the things that we've been thinking about. The first is and this one  we ... It has been just the foundational way that we got started which is  start with something insanely simple and then focus on expanding it over time. When we  got started, if you were in enterprise IT or you worked at one of our  competitors like Microsoft or SAP or in Oracle and you looked at our software, you  literally would have died laughing. You would have looked at our technology and you'd be  like, "That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen." All it does is you upload  a file and then you access the file. It was that simplicity that was actually  why it was so disruptive because all of those vendors thought that the problem was  we just need to jam in as many features as humanly possible into one piece  of software. That was correlated with our value proposition. That was sort of how enterprise  software companies operated. Mostly because we weren't focused on the enterprise, we just took the  opposite approach. We said actually the fewer features, the simpler set of functionality in one  place is actually going to be our value proposition. If you were in classic enterprise  software, you would have looked at our product and you would have thought it was  a toy essentially. You would have been like, "That is never going to serve enterprises.  It's not going to serve regulated businesses. It's not going to serve complex work flows."  What they didn't recognize was that was just the start. That was just our day  one use case. That was the day one thing that we were trying to solve.  The instinct and the tendency and this still happens today like at our company 12  years later when we've learned this I think so directly, you still have this tendency.  Anybody in this room that goes out and brainstorms like how could we build a  big enterprise software company, you're going to brainstorm by like listing out lots and lots  and lots of things. You're going to list out lots and lots and lots of  features. This wishlist of what if you could just build all this cool shit. That's  not how actually how you're going to be successful. You're going to be successful by  nailing one use case that just happens to be a use case that everybody has  a massive problem with. If you can nail that one use case, that becomes essentially  the wedge to then use to expand out to all the other use cases that  you want to go and solve. You have to sort of resist the natural instinct  which is that more functionality, more powerful software is better and really make sure that  you're focused on one thing that you're going to do better than everybody else. A  great example that I've been rereminded of this over and over from is a company  called Gusto that was previously called ZenPayroll. What they did was they just said that  payroll software and payroll services sucks in small businesses as an example. They built a  software application that was just about making sure your employees get paid as efficiently as  possible. Then eventually that was so successful and they got embedded into so many businesses  that they could eventually expand to more and more HR services and more and more  things that an HR team has to do with their employees. They started with that  one use case which is let's just get payroll right, make it so successful, so  simple, so effective that then you could build up over time. Again when starting out,  you have to resist the urge to want to build a lot of functionality and  really focus on one use case that people are going to be able to easily  describe to other people and then be able to go from there. That's the first  lesson. Again 12 years in we're still having to relearn this over and over again.  The amount of product meetings that I end up in where we have to be  like we have to remove that feature, we have to hide that thing, we have  to make that simpler, it never goes away. Even when you're bigger, you still have  to make sure you're really, really focused on keeping things dead simple and almost deceptively  simple in what you're actually going to go and do for the customer. Because it  just turns out that in these cases having less functionality gives people way more opportunity  then go use your service and it's counterintuitive. The more functionality you have, the more  you're going to narrow the set of customers that ultimately are going to be able  to sort of make sense of your product and want to use your product. That's  the first thing. I think that as you're starting your company you really need to  think hard about this one which is make sure that you're benefiting form a major  technology tailwind. There's so many companies that get started where there's no particular macro technology  trend that they're riding on top of. In some cases even worst. There could be  technology trends that you're sort of resisting or that are sort of points of friction  for you. You really have to think hard about what is going on in the  technology landscape that I am going to be able to ride that wave with my  innovation where the growth of whatever that technology trend is is something that I can  then grow alongside. In our case we benefited from three or four mega trends. We  benefited from the growth of mobile. We benefited from the lower cost of computing. We  benefited from the fact that everybody was coming onto the internet. All three of those  trends were disruptive to our incumbents that were selling traditional enterprise software. We were able  to take these mega trends that we had nothing to do with, take these mega  trends, ride on top of them and they were just an onslaught of basically disaster  for the traditional competitors in the space. Try and find what are the technology trends  that you think incumbents are not going to be able to respond well to because  they're sort of economically, strategically or from a talent standpoint not able to leverage those  technology trends in the same way that you can. PlanGrid is a pretty cool example  of this. They basically do software for construction companies and for architecture firms and builders  to be able to let you do blueprints and other kind of construction projects on  the iPad and the iPhone. It's a pretty dead simple idea, but it's going after  just the fact that there's billions of dollars spent every single year on either software  that is stuck on your computer or paper-based processes. They could basically ride the growth  of mobile and the growth of mobile in this sort of field worker scenarios to  be able to grow with that. They nailed the timing perfectly of okay, it was  a couple years after the iPad. Now's the time where these devices are going to  start to show up in physical environments. What is the software that we need to  do to be able to let construction teams and building companies be able to use  that technology? Really make sure that you're going to benefit significantly from a major tailwind  and don't create unnecessarily head winds for yourself. Your product in a perfect world should  really literally sell itself. This is again when you're going out and you're building for  the enterprise, instinctively you're not thinking about how can I make the product be that  sort of point of viral adoption. Because we're so used to building up sales teams  and building up all the customer relationships which are still important because you're still going  to have to use probably sales to ultimately close large deals with clients, but make  sure that the product itself is something that can be adopted, spread and utilized without  any friction by the end user. Sales really should be used to close big deals,  not to drive product adoption and that's a big distinction in the traditional enterprise software  world where sales was sort of the only way that you could push out production  adoption into companies. We put a huge emphasis on all of our sharing functionality in  Box. When you had a document that you wanted to share, we wanted to make  it really, really, really simple to be able to share those files around. Then the  software would spread itself as opposed to us having to just keep selling it into  companies like the traditional enterprise software vendors were doing. Then you use sales to close  bigger deals essentially, to help sort of navigate in that customer environment. Slack today is  sort of the perfect quintessential example of a viral enterprise software product where the very  usage of the service is to then spread to other people because by definition you're  communicating with other people. They've really done this extremely well which is make sure that  you're building a product that is as easy to adopt and as viral as possible.  Every single thing about that product is tuned for the end user to be able  to be empowered to spread it on their own so they can build their own  sort of viral distribution channel. Sales then comes in later and then you can sell  additional services or capabilities to that enterprise. You really want to have a bifurcation between  product adoption and sales, sort of making sure that you're doing the bigger deals. Bless  you. Okay. Next one. Spend time, a lot of time, with your futuristic customers, but  don't exactly just build what they're asking for. What happens when you're building for the  enterprise, you will always have ... Just inevitably you always have a bell curve of  customers of how innovative or how leaning into the future they are versus how conservative  they are. It's the customers that are at the first 5 to 10% of that  bell curve. They're at the bleeding edge of everything. They wait in line and they  get the AirPods and they have an Amazon Alexa at their desk in their office.  These are the customers that you want to spend a lot of time with because  they're going to see things even before you will about how your technology could be  used in their environment. They're going to spot trends of what's happening in their employee  base and how they want to push your technology farther than you even would have  imagined would have been possible. The amount of sort of innovation that we've been able  to drive because of what we've heard from those customers is probably a significant percentage  of what we've ended up building. The difference is from legacy enterprise software companies to  today is back in the day what you would do is you would just ask  them what do you want us to build and then you go build those things  because that would essentially lead to a sale or an upsell. What you need to  do is listen to what are the issues that they're seeing. What are the things  they wish your product could do. Then either work with them or come back with  solutions that maybe aren't exactly what they asked for. Maybe they aren't the specific features  that they ask for, but are going to eventually get them down the path that  really they're trying to push your product then. We spend a lot of time listening  to customers, but not building exactly what they ask for. Because when you just build  what a customer asks for, essentially you become this sort of amalgamation of feature request  from every single one of your customers. There's no way that you're going to then  be able to keep a consistent north star with your product. You're going to be  sort of pulled and locked to different directions by lots of different customers. The software  vendors that do it really wrong is by not listening at all to those early  adopters. They start focusing on the most conservative companies. They start focusing on the people  that will only adopt if they build all of the features that they ask for.  That's really how you go wrong in enterprise software because then you really lose sight  of your vision and ultimately what you're trying to build. We have a bunch of  different groups that we work with to try and learn all of the things that  the customer would want. We have lots of advisory boards and we're getting lists of  hundreds and hundreds of requests, but we don't just go and build whatever those requests  are. We spend a lot of time thinking about how can we connect the dots  between multiple requests or multiple ideas to build the solution that people didn't really even  think about previously. Also another area where software companies go wrong is you're going to  get a lot of requests from customers that are sort of contradictory in nature. Somebody  in financial services is going to say, "I want this functionality for my bank." Then  somebody in life science is going to say, "I want this functionality for my pharmaceutical  company." You're not going to be able to kind of like actually synchronize those requests,  the fundamentally required different user experiences, different product functionality. Where a lot of stuff where  companies go wrong is you start to build all these features in isolation. Then you  zoom out five years later and you've just built this massive technology that has like  okay, we've got this vertical offering for that industry. Then we've got a separate vertical  offering for that industry. You can learn a lot from companies like Salesforce which essentially  said, "Okay. We're going to build these modular components that can be mixed and matched  to create user experiences for different industries, for different lines of business, for different job  functions. We're not going to bake in all of the functionality directly into the product.  We're going to give customers the tools or even our own team to do that  customization themselves." A lot of companies get into a trap where you just are mindlessly  building lots of features. You zoom out a few years later and what you have  is this mess of serving a whole bunch of different industries with a really, really  bad user experience. The thing that we still stayed true to today and this is  where ... This one gets harder and harder over time especially as the deals get  bigger and bigger is making sure that at any juncture you're not ever trading off  the user experience for some enterprise feature or some feature that's going to get you  a bigger deal. There's going to be hundreds of times where you're at this moment  where the customer is asking for something that is antithetical or going to go against  the simplicity of that user experience. Maybe it's a security feature. Maybe it's a compliance  feature. Maybe it's something that they're just trying to put in the way of the  end user. Every single one of those decision points we have made sure that we  always favor the end user over the enterprise. In some cases that means that we  will lose deals. We'll have to say no to a customer because by building that  feature, we don't think we're going to be able to deliver the delight and the  user experience that we're looking for over time. That gets really, really painful because you  lose then deals all throughout the years. If I look back over the past 10  years, we've lost tens of millions of dollars of business because we said no to  certain customers. What we benefited from though was a product that many, many years later  could serve a much wider population of customers. Then ended up making our existing customers  much more successful with our product. Funny enough the companies that once didn't say yes  to us and took their business somewhere else ended up being unsuccessful with those products  and had to eventually come back to us. If you're right and the key point  here is you have to be right, if you're right and that user trade-off truly  was going to be disastrous for that user experience and you remain true to that  north star of always focusing on the user, eventually over the long run and long  run can be defined whatever your market is in, you will end up winning in  that market over the long run, but you're going to lose deals along the way.  That's going to be really stressful for you, for your team, for investors, but it's  really important that you're crystal clear on the principles of how you're building your product  and what you're going to say no to. Finally, find ways and this goes back  to that technology trend thing, but try and find ways where you can have asymmetrical  or asymmetric advantages over the competitors. What you'll find is that your competitors, the big  incumbents, can be locked in pretty significantly to particular business models because they in some  cases have tens of thousands of employees that are built up to build and to  deliver products in a very specific way. If you can find points of differentiation and  a disruption that they can't respond to because either it is too expensive for them  to respond to or strategically it doesn't make as much sense for them to respond  or they don't have maybe the talent to respond to it, that is how you  ultimately remain disruptive to these bigger companies. It's the only way to survive as a  small startup. Amazon Web Services, we take it for granted now how easily you can  build a company just by writing some code and deploy it on the AWS. 10  years ago, 15 years ago, what you had to do is you had to buy  all these servers. You had to put them in data centers. You had to wrap  them yourselves. You had to connect them all together and that will take weeks or  months and cost in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars just to get your  startup going. That's the benefit to us as building software companies. Think about now the  difference if you're one of the vendors that built that hardware and you sold those  servers and you sold that data center space. Think about how disruptive Amazon Web Services  was coming out of nowhere and having a completely different model where now I don't  have to buy servers anymore because I can just go to Amazon. Amazon did something  that was so disruptive to the core business model of traditional server makers and software  providers that literally those companies to this day have not even responded. 12 years later  they still have not responded by being to deliver these capabilities over the cloud because  of how disruptive it is from a business model standpoint. Really try and identify are  there things from a product standpoint that could be highly disruptive to how your product  can be delivered to clients versus how incumbent solutions were delivered. I kind of wrap  all of this up with a Steve Jobs quote. It's a requirement that you have  a Steve Jobs quote in any product presentation so I need to meet that quota.  This is really true and it's especially true in enterprise. It's like really true in  consumer, but it's like even more true in enterprise software because what happens is enterprises  are just asking for solutions to all their problems. In many cases they don't know  what the right solution is until you come out of nowhere with something they never  would be possible. In our case, just in our product, literally if you took 100  IT people from 100 different companies 12 years ago and you said, "Draw out the  best way for your company to manage documents, manage files, secure their information," not in  100 attempts would our solution have been sort of designed because everybody was so used  to the technology has to be really complex, it has to have these interface buttons,  it has to have all these features for it to make sense. We came in  with a product that nobody would have anticipated because of how dead simple it was.  You can't really go ask your customers just like, "Hey, what do you want us  to do," and then somehow you're going to end up with a really great solution.  You have to really think hard about what is possible in the feature, what are  the things that maybe your customers aren't anticipating and you have to build that. Then  essentially have that land inside of the customer base. Really make sure that you're not  just building what customers are asking for because no great technology has been built that  way. Last thing that I'll leave you with, it's my ... I think they're my  four favorite books on building B2B stuff. Don't hold me to me, but here are  four good books that I would highly recommend reading if you're going to build a  B2B software company. It gets you into the mindset and have the frame of reference  of how to think about growth, disruption, building a new market and then ultimately going  out and building a company that can scale in the space. If I had read  these four books 12 years ago, I think we would have not had to learn  these lessons so slowly. I would highly recommend checking these out. With that, I would  just say good luck. Please do not compete with me. I don't need more competition.  Do not use my advice against me in any way. Hope to see you in  the market. Take care. Okay. I don't know what happens next, but ... I have  time. I have like five minutes, but I don't know how it works with people.  Okay. All right. I can answer questions or you can leave. Either way. Okay. Yes?
Audience: What are some ways that you would actually suggest because similar to you when you  were actually back in school, you may not have had the chance to work in  other startup companies. I want to know your take on that.
Aaron Levie: It's hard because I haven't had to do what you're asking which is ... Then  the question was how do you discover issues that enterprises are having without necessarily working  inside the enterprise. I think one is spend a lot of time with people that  everyday they're going into the office and they're running into all these problems and I  would just go interview like a hundred people. Just like, "Walk me through your day.  What are all the places where you are less effective, less efficient? Having to do  repetitive or redundant work?" Don't ask for technology problems. Just listen to where they're spending  their time and what processes do they keep repeating over and over again. Then you  can start to imagine well, how could software go and attack that problem? How could  software attack the problem of meeting scheduling? Not a big market, but one space. How  could software attack the problem of payroll? How could software attack the problem of expense  reporting? All of these kind of things are the drudgery of working inside of a  big company. If you haven't worked in one of those big companies, you at least  have to get as much information as you can from people that do work in  those big companies. Then you can start to see partners of like okay, this seems  like a really big problem. In our case if you had interviewed clients or people  that worked in big enterprises 15 years ago and you said, "Walk me through your  day," I think you would have eventually spotted how much time is wasted when people  are working with their documents and they're trying to share their documents and they're trying  to access their documents from different devices. If you really peel that apart and you  ask all the right questions, you would have actually discovered this problem. We discovered it  because of what we were doing in our personal lives in college, but you would  have also discovered it by just understanding where people are spending time in the workplace  and then saying, "Hey, wait a second. That doesn't make sense because technology today could  solve that problem way better than what they're getting as solutions." As soon as you  find that gap, that's where you can build the company.
Audience: Thank you.
Aaron Levie: Yeah.
Audience: I was wondering like you mentioned about riding the tech wave. In your opinion, what  do you think is the biggest tech wave now?
Aaron Levie: Well, it's not Bitcoin. Sorry to all the Bitcoin startups. Bitcoin could be up in  the top five or something, but I don't want to offend all the Bitcoin people.  I'm going to get like hate mail. Can we edit that part out about my  attack on Bitcoin? I'm going to say a bunch of the trends. I don't know  how to rank order them, but obviously AR/VR is a big one. I think AR/VR  is in a challenging spot because we don't have ubiquitous devices yet. The question is  is AR/VR like mobile was 12 years ago or is it still another five years  away? The last thing you want to do is be the mobile startup of 2001  because those startups died. It's actually really hard to predict these things. I don't have  any advice on how do you predict if it's actually going to happen or not,  but there was a bunch of mobile companies and funny enough, Sam Altman would have  good stories around this back in like 2004 building a mobile company and how hard  it was because you didn't have the iPhone. Before the iPhone, it really sucked being  in mobile. That's kind of the state of things right now if you're building AR/VR  which is like we know this is probably the future. We don't know if we're  looking at the right era of it yet. That will be the one caveat I  just say. It's going to be the future we don't know exactly when. AI is  a massive tech trend. It doesn't necessary benefit though startups versus incumbents. It's going to  be more pervasive than that. I don't know how to necessarily use it as an  advantage over an incumbent because the incumbents are actually like almost superior in this technology  right now. Let's see. I mean you can always expect the cost of computing is  just going to continue to drop. We thought that was a trend 12 years ago.  Well, it hasn't gone away and it's actually more powerful than ever before. I think  there's some pretty cool things like as an example and I might have to change  my own even definition of this of like thinking about the compounding of two trends.  For instance, AI and cheap computing together are actually the really powerful trend right now.  Google just launched this new service that does image recognition and video recognition, object recognition  inside of images and videos. Just via an API, you can send Google an image  or a video and it will tell you what's in that image or video. That  would have taken like a hundred engineers five years ago to go build that. Now  you get it as a simple API from Google. Thinking about wait a second, like  what happens when you have a bunch of these new services that are being created  on our behalf from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, et cetera? What's the new set of problems  that we could use those solutions and build software for? Maybe you build a company  that does security cameras that plugs into Google computer vision API. Maybe you build a  new way to navigate or search for images and data because of these APIs. There's  a lot of new problems that you wouldn't have even been able to see were  a problem before you knew that this technology was possible. Now you can start to  look at the world in a different way if you have complete understanding of what  all those APIs are that are out there now. Maybe the last question. Yeah?
Audience: I was wondering what's your opinion on a startup using other enterprise softwares on your  platform?
Aaron Levie: Like what's an example?
Audience: I guess like servers are pretty obvious to use, but like for instance like money  transactions, doing something for that and you have something specific that maybe could be built  versus like ...
Aaron Levie: I think the question is sort of like when do you decide what to build  versus what to use other companies for and I think for us I generally believe  that anything that is not your core competency, you need to make sure that you're  using the best in class outside solution for. The moment that you realize I'm not  going to be the best company at payments, you better be using Stripe or something  else for that problem. You shouldn't be building that yourself. The last thing you want  to do is spend anytime as a company building out things that the market is  going to solve better than you will and make sure that you are extremely clear  on your core competency. I think this is actually where startups go sort of the  wrong way a lot of times is not getting crystal clear on what is the  thing that we can do that the market is not going to go and build  and commoditize. What's interesting and we've learned this over the years is that's not a  static definition. The market is always changing. Your core competency might actually be changing every  couple of years because you have to adapt with the realities of the market. If  I go back 10 years ago or 12 years ago, we had that picture of  the four of us, we would go into data centers and we were building out  our own storage infrastructure. We knew that it sucked that we were building out our  own storage infrastructure because we knew somebody else could be doing this better than us,  but there was no other solution. Fast forward to today, we have no problem using  Amazon for all of that. We have no illusion that that is somehow a point  of differentiation or value for us. The moment that the rest of the market catches  up and commoditizes something that you you used to be good at, you need to  get away from that part of the market as fast as possible. Cool. All right.  I got to jump. Good luck guys. Take care.
