# Live Office Hours with Adora Cheung and Avichal Garg

Speaker 1: Hey everyone. For today's Live Office Hours we're joined by Adora and Avichal, and I'll  leave it to them to introduce themselves.

演讲者1：大家好。今天的现场办公时间，我们加入了阿多拉和阿维夏尔，我将留给他们介绍自己。

Adora Cheung: I'm Adora Cheung. I am a partner at Y Combinator. Previously, I was the founder/CEO  of a startup called Homejoy.

张朵拉：我是张爱多拉。我是Y Combinator的合伙人。在此之前，我曾是一家名为Homejoy的初创公司的创始人/首席执行官。

Avichal Garg: Hey, Avichal Garg, I'm a YC expert. I was most recently director of product at  Facebook. I've done a couple startups, sold a couple, invested in a bunch.

阿维夏尔·加格：嘿，阿维夏尔·加格，我是YC专家。我最近是Facebook的产品总监。我做过几家初创公司，卖掉了几家，投资了很多公司。

Angela: Angela.

安吉拉：安吉拉。

Adora Cheung: Hello, Adora, nice to meet you.

张爱多拉：你好，阿多拉，很高兴见到你。

Avichal Garg: Avichal, good to meet you.

阿维夏尔·加格：阿维夏尔，很高兴见到你。

Adora Cheung: Cool, welcome. So, tell us what you do.

张朵拉：很好，欢迎。告诉我们你是做什么的。

Angela: Hi, we're working on Appmission. It's a web application that offers high quality, personalized college  admission advice for high school students.

安琪拉：嗨，我们在做阿普任务。这是一个网络应用程序，为高中生提供高质量、个性化的大学入学建议。

Adora Cheung: So, is there another person on the other end, or how does the ... Can  you give the most common use case of how people use it?
Angela: So, a student can sign up for free, and then they will create a profile.  The profile includes the academic information, including the GPA, test scores, and also extracurricular activities,  and the college goals. For example, the colleges that they want to get into and  also the majors they are interested in. So, once they enter the data, we use  our algorithm to generate a personalized recommendation to them to help them reach their goals.

张朵拉：那么，在另一端还有其他人吗，或者.你能给出人们如何使用它的最常见的用例吗？安吉拉：所以，一个学生可以免费注册，然后他们会创建一个个人资料。简介包括学术信息，包括GPA、考试成绩、课外活动和大学目标。例如，他们想进入的大学以及他们感兴趣的专业。因此，一旦他们输入数据，我们使用我们的算法生成一个个性化的推荐给他们，以帮助他们实现他们的目标。

Avichal Garg: Gotcha. So, who's using this or who do you want to use this?
Angela: The high school students and their parents.

明白了。那么，是谁用这个，还是你想用这个？安吉拉：高中生和他们的父母。

Avichal Garg: Who, more specifically?
Angela: For those who cannot afford private college counseling, because the price range is from $4,000  to $40,000 per package.

阿维夏尔·加格：更具体地说，是谁？安吉拉：对于那些买不起私立大学辅导的人来说，因为每包的价格从4，000美元到40，000美元不等。

Avichal Garg: I see. And why would they use this?
Angela: Because in the U.S. Public high school, one counselor serves 491 students, and each student  only gets 38 minutes of college advising per year, so we want to fill in  the gap so they can get access and we think that every student deserves the  help they need to get into college.

我明白了。他们为什么要用这个？安吉拉：因为在美国公立高中，有一名辅导员为491名学生提供服务，每个学生每年只能得到38分钟的大学咨询，所以我们想填补这个空缺，让他们有机会进入学校，我们认为每个学生都应该得到进入大学所需的帮助。

Adora Cheung: Is there one particular thing that they really need help on? Because one of the  things I think a lot of people only buy a lot of books about is  essays, because the application itself is pretty objective and standard, right? So, do you find  there's a specific feature that people are really looking for and will actually pay for?
Angela: Yeah, that's interesting. When we first started, we kind of just came pretty broad. We  talked about our essays, we talked about college selections. But recently, when we talked to  some of the users, we found out that they want one-on-one interactions, and specifically on  college selection and the essay.

张朵拉：有什么特别的事情，他们真的需要帮助吗？因为我认为很多人只买了很多书是关于散文的，因为申请本身是相当客观和标准的，对吗？那么，你是否发现有一个特殊的功能，人们真的在寻找，并将实际支付？安琪拉：是的，这很有趣。当我们刚开始的时候，我们刚刚来的相当广泛。我们谈论我们的论文，我们谈论大学的选择。但是最近，当我们和一些用户交谈时，我们发现他们想要一对一的互动，特别是关于大学的选择和文章。

Adora Cheung: So are you building a marketplace then, of people?
Angela: So when we first started, we just kind of did it on our own, like  the backend is us. But actually, we talked to Anton, our mentor on this at  our school, and we also got some feedback from users saying they want one-on-one interactions.  So, last weekend, our team spent 30 hours to build and launch that marketplace.

张朵拉：那么，你是在为人们建立一个市场吗？安吉拉：所以当我们刚开始的时候，我们只是自己做的，就像后端是我们一样。但是事实上，我们和我们学校的导师Anton谈过了，我们也从用户那里得到了一些反馈，他们说他们想要一对一的互动。所以，上周末，我们的团队花了30个小时来建立和推出这个市场。

Adora Cheung: And how's that going?
Angela: It's going quicker than I expected. So we, for the past three days we had  about 800 people visit the site, and then we had about 60 advisors signed up.  So right now, because of the marketplace, we focus on the supply side first.

张朵拉：那怎么样？安琪拉：比我预期的要快。所以我们，在过去的三天里，我们有大约800人访问了这个网站，然后我们有大约60名顾问注册了。所以现在，由于市场的原因，我们首先关注的是供应方面。

Adora Cheung: Okay, so you have 60 advisors, and so you're focused on acquiring those. Do you  think that's enough? It seems like enough because it's a ... Excuse me?
Female : I don't think they can hear you.

张朵拉：好吧，你有60位顾问，所以你专注于获得这些。你觉得够了吗？看起来够了因为这是.。对不起，你说什么?女：我想他们听不见你。

Adora Cheung: Can you hear me?
Avichal Garg: Hear me and Adora or these guys?
Adora Cheung: Oh, there we go. Or is this not on?
Female : Can everybody hear in the back?
Adora Cheung: Are we doing okay? I can yell also. Does this make it better?
Avichal Garg: It may not have been on before. Is that better?
Adora Cheung: Are we good? Are we good? Okay, cool.

张朵拉：你能听到我说话吗？听到我和阿多拉还是这些家伙吗？张朵拉：哦，开始了。还是这不是开着的？每个人都能听到后面的声音吗？张：我们还好吗？我也可以大叫。这样会好点吗？阿维夏尔·加格：这可能以前没开过。这样更好吗？张朵拉：我们还好吗？我们还好吗？好吧，酷。

Avichal Garg: In back?
Adora Cheung: Sorry about that. So supply side acquisition. So you got 60 advisors, it looks like  you're ready to go then, right?
Angela: Yeah, we're ready to go but then we right now our next step is to  review those advisors and make sure that their profile is nice and that they are  high quality of counselors who have specialized certain areas so that we can use those  to attract the students.

在后面？张朵拉：很抱歉。所以供应方收购。你有60位顾问，看来你准备好了，对吧？安琪拉：是的，我们已经准备好了，但是我们现在的下一步是审查这些顾问，确保他们的形象很好，并且他们是高素质的具有特定领域的顾问，这样我们就可以利用他们来吸引学生。

Avichal Garg: Why is now the right time to do this? This could have been done five  years ago, has something changed in the world that makes this possible now?
Angela: I think that at our industry has been grown slower than other consumer-based technology, so  I think right now is a good time because the parents and student they are  getting more and more tools in their school using technology to learn, like personalized learning  and collaborative learning, so I think this is the space where it has not been  fully utilized yet.

阿维夏尔·加格：为什么现在是这样做的合适时机？五年前就可以这样做了，现在世界上发生了一些变化，使这一切成为可能吗？安吉拉：我认为我们这个行业的发展速度比其他以消费者为基础的技术发展得慢，所以我认为现在是一个很好的时机，因为他们的父母和学生在他们的学校里越来越多地使用技术来学习，比如个性化学习和协作学习，所以我认为这是一个还没有被充分利用的空间。

Avichal Garg: Why do you think that is?
Angela: I think the reason why is people usually they focus really on tutoring, they've put  a lot of those energy on to getting good grades. And then they feel like  they know exactly how they can get into college just based on their friends and  family. So they rely a lot of those personal advice from their friends and family  or whoever have gone through that, but we want to give them the professional side  of thing.

阿维夏尔·加格：你认为这是为什么？安吉拉：我认为原因是人们通常把注意力放在辅导上，他们把很多精力都花在了获得好成绩上。然后，他们觉得，他们知道如何才能进入大学，仅仅是基于他们的朋友和家人。所以他们很大程度上依赖朋友和家人的个人建议，或者那些经历过这些的人，但是我们想给他们一些专业方面的帮助。

Adora Cheung: It seems like the amount of information out there is out there and so people  are probably trying to differentiate themselves because there's the internet and I can get that  same access as person A or person B, right? And so it makes sense that  you need somebody else to tell you how to make it better versus just reading  stuff. So I wanted to focus on, it seems like your biggest challenge right now  is going to be matching, right? So you have 60 advisors, do you believe they're  ... It sounds like you believe that they're high quality enough right now to start  matching them?
Female : Some of them not all of them.

张爱多拉：外面的信息量似乎很大，所以人们可能会试图区分自己，因为有互联网，我可以和A人或B人一样访问，对吗？因此，你需要其他人告诉你如何使它变得更好，而不是仅仅阅读一些东西，这是有意义的。所以我想把重点放在，你现在最大的挑战是匹配，对吗？你有60位顾问，你认为他们.听起来你认为它们的质量很高，现在就可以开始匹配它们了？女性：其中一些并不是全部。

Adora Cheung: So how are you going to, or what are your top two, three determinants of  bringing on these advisors in?
Female : So definitely one of the things that we are looking for is whether the counselor  or the advisor is certified or licensed. Again, we just launched more occupations a few  days ago, what we are going to do is to focus on those profiles that  are existing right now and talk to the actual advisors to see if they have  the credential.

张朵拉：那么你打算怎么做，或者你的前两位，三个决定因素是什么？女：所以，我们要找的事情之一就是顾问或顾问是否获得了认证或执照。再一次，我们在几天前刚刚推出了更多的职业，我们要做的是把重点放在现在存在的那些个人资料上，并与实际的顾问交谈，看看他们是否有证书。

Adora Cheung: Are you advisors yourselves?
Angela: I am.

张朵拉：你们自己是顾问吗？安吉拉：我是。

Female : Yeah, Angela is.

是的，安吉拉是。

Adora Cheung: So you're on the site?
Angela: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

张：所以你在网站上？安琪拉：嗯-嗯(是的)。

Adora Cheung: Okay, and have you why don't, I mean one thing would be just to match  people to you and to figure that piece of-
Angela: Right, so when I start doing that I had one person, which I met in  person because they basically meet with me in person that's how we got ... We  think that that is something that would be valuable, but we already stop putting myself  out there into ... On the supply side.

张朵拉：好吧，你为什么不这么做呢？我的意思是，有一件事就是把别人和你联系起来，让她明白-安琪拉：对，当我开始这样做的时候，我有一个人，我亲自认识了，因为他们基本上是亲自见我的，这就是我们得到的.我们认为这是有价值的，但我们已经不再把自己投入到.在供应方面。

Avichal Garg: So, there's a whole set of product risk here, which I think you guys have  worked through. The thing I keep coming back to is actually the market risk on  this one. So my first start up was in education so I know a ton  about this space actually. Historically, the challenge has been that the way that the average  person in the US thinks about things like college admissions is actually pretty different than  the way that people who are in this room probably think about college education. And  fundamentally a lot of that comes down to do you think about education as an  investment or an expenditure. This happens in a lot of markets where you kind of  build for yourself and then you realize the market doesn't actually behave the way that  you behave and so there's a leap that sometimes companies aren't able to make. That's  why I was sort of probing on that is like has the market actually underneath  has changed. Have you actually validated that people want the same thing that you want  and that that market is large enough to actually support a business.

阿维夏尔·加格：所以，这里有一套完整的产品风险，我认为你们已经解决了。我一直想说的是这件事的市场风险。所以我的第一次创业是在教育领域，所以我对这个领域了解很多。从历史上看，挑战在于，美国普通民众对大学入学等问题的思考方式，实际上与在座的人们对大学教育的思考方式有很大的不同。从根本上讲，这其中有很多是你认为教育是一种投资还是一种支出。这种情况发生在很多你为自己建立的市场中，然后你意识到市场的表现并不像你那样，所以有时公司无法实现一次飞跃。这就是为什么我对此进行了某种探索，就像市场实际上已经发生了变化。你真的验证过人们想要的东西和你想要的一样的东西，而且市场足够大，足以真正支持一家企业吗？

Angela: Well actually there's recent change that I think would give us the opportunity, which is  the new administration. Because we're talking about funding cut into public school system so we  were expect that the resources that they have will be less and less, and I  think that is an opportunity to educate the parents and student and it should promote  the needs of having college advising.

安琪拉：事实上，我认为最近有一些变化会给我们带来机会，那就是新一届政府。因为我们说的是削减公立学校系统的资金，所以我们希望他们拥有的资源会越来越少，我认为这是一个教育家长和学生的机会，它应该促进大学咨询的需求。

Avichal Garg: Gotcha, but they don't currently get it today?
Angela: Right, they get very minimal.

阿维夏尔·加格：明白了，但他们今天还不明白？安琪拉：对，他们得到的非常少。

Adora Cheung: What resources do people have 'cause there's books, there used to be sites like vault.com,  which I don't think gives advice anymore, so what are they using right now?
Angela: Right, so there are a lot of free sites out there like College Board, they  have check, they have different web sites that tells them the details of the colleges  that probably the application rates and all those stuff, but those are not personalized for  them. When we did an interview with the users, they found it very overwhelming to  go through all these different site.

张爱多拉：人们有什么资源，因为有书，以前有像vault.com这样的网站，我不认为这些网站能给出建议，那么他们现在用的是什么呢？安琪拉：对，所以有很多免费的网站，比如大学委员会，他们有支票，他们有不同的网站，告诉他们大学的详细情况，可能是申请率和所有这些东西，但这些都不是个性化的。当我们对用户进行采访时，他们发现浏览所有这些不同的网站是非常困难的。

Avichal Garg: Who were the people that you were interviewing? Where did you find those?
Angela: We found it from our neighborhood, found it from our friends' kids and basically people  that we know.

阿维夏尔·加格：你采访的人是谁？你在哪找到的？安吉拉：我们是从我们的邻居那里找到的，是从我们朋友的孩子和我们认识的人那里找到的。

Avichal Garg: Right, I keep coming back to this. I think specifically this is one of the  biggest risks in the education market is that the mass market is going to behave  differently than the people that you know. So actually validating by talking to those people  what their needs are and what you want to build for those people and what  they want is actually pretty critical early one because people from your neighborhood probably think  about education very similarly to the way you do. Or your friends' kids probably think  about education very similarly to the way-
Angela: That's why ever since we launched we try to iterate different ideas under the site  to see which one catch more of the attention. So far I think we were  able to identify that one on one personalized interaction is important, but I think the  next step we want to drill down into something more specific so that we can  just focus on that one thing.

阿维夏尔·加格：对，我一直在讨论这个问题。我认为，具体来说，这是教育市场最大的风险之一，就是大众市场的行为将不同于你所认识的人。因此，通过与这些人交谈来验证他们的需求和你想为这些人建立的东西实际上是非常早期的，因为你所在的社区的人们对教育的思考可能与你的方式非常相似。或者你朋友的孩子们对教育的看法可能和我们的方式非常相似-安吉拉：这就是为什么自从我们推出以来，我们就尝试在网站下面迭代不同的想法，看看哪一个吸引了更多的注意力。到目前为止，我认为我们能够识别出一对一的个性化交互是很重要的，但是我认为下一步我们想深入到更具体的方面，这样我们就可以专注于这一件事情了。

Avichal Garg: Have you guys considered the international markets at all? Is this just a US problem  or is this like a global problem?
Female : We thought about it, there's some leads that we talked to. There's definitely the potential  there for international markets but the platform that we have been on so far is  really targeted to US. But that doesn't really limit us on expanding to more markets.

阿维夏尔·加格：你们考虑过国际市场吗？这只是一个美国的问题，还是一个全球性的问题？女：我们考虑过了，我们谈过一些线索。国际市场肯定有潜力，但我们迄今所使用的平台实际上是针对美国的。但这并不限制我们向更多市场扩张。

Avichal Garg: Yeah, have you thought about going international first? As opposed to US first?
Female : Our target was basically states first, that was the focus and in fact our website  is admission.us so is more like a ... But definitely again we do know that  there are people out there outside of United States who want to study here in  the States and they need that information as well. We talk to advisors as well  from outside of the country and there's the need but we don't really have any  like, let's target those market, yet.

阿维夏尔·加格：是的，你考虑过先去国际市场吗？而不是美国第一？女性：我们的目标基本上是先陈述，那是重点，事实上我们的网站是认可的，所以我们更像是一个.但我们确实知道，在美国以外的地方，有一些人想在美国学习，他们也需要这些信息。我们也和国外的顾问谈过，这是有必要的，但我们并没有真正的相似之处，让我们瞄准那些市场吧。

Adora Cheung: How many users are on your site right now?
Angela: We have about 200 students.

张：现在你的网站上有多少用户？安吉拉：我们有大约200名学生。

Adora Cheung: 200 students and where are they, what's the common element among all of them?
Angela: So we have 40% of those are seniors so that tells me that they are  pretty, they wait until pretty last minute to do this and then there are 25%  the junior and majority of them are focusing on computer science and engineering math type  and business majors.

张：200名学生，他们在哪里，他们的共同点是什么？安吉拉：我们有40%的学生是高年级学生，这告诉我他们很漂亮，他们等到最后一刻才开始做这件事，然后有25%的学生和大部分学生专注于计算机科学和工程、数学类型和商业专业。

Adora Cheung: It sounds like you might want to, I know this is kind of what I  think Avichal is getting at also, is trying to figure out what is that core  thing that they really need versus this like, right now it seems a little abstract  of I'm going to help you find a college but it might be something as  simple as the essay, like I need help on the essay and just focus on  that one thing and drive it home versus being a little bit, doing so many  things at once.

张：听起来你可能想，我知道这也是我认为阿维夏尔想得到的，试图找出他们真正需要的核心东西是什么，相对于这个，现在我似乎有点抽象，我要帮你找到一所大学，但它可能是像文章一样简单的东西，。就像我在这篇文章上需要帮助，把注意力集中在这件事上，把它带回家，而不是一点点，一次做这么多事情。

Female : Yeah, so admission submission is to make sure that we provide the same opportunity for  all students, that chance to go into college. We understand that definitely within maybe California,  maybe in bigger cities that people, students are more educated, more they have the background  of what's the path to college and beyond that what we are trying to do  again going back to mission we want to make sure that outside of these group  of students people from outside of California also have the same access to the same  information. If you think about ... Or actually based on our survey or talking to  users, we know that a lot of students actually think they might not even have  the chance to go into colleges because it might not be affordable to them. But  there's definitely alternatives for them like financial aid and things like that. That's the tier  that we're trying to target to make sure that they have access to the information  so that they know they at least have the chance to apply to college or  maybe qualify for financial aid and path.

女：是的，所以入学申请是为了确保我们为所有的学生提供同样的机会，那就是进入大学的机会。我们明白，也许是在加州，也许是在更大的城市，学生受教育程度更高，他们更了解通往大学的道路，除此之外，我们还想要做的是重新回到使命，我们希望确保这些学生群体以外的人，从加州以外的人，也有同样的机会获得同样的信息。如果你考虑.。或者根据我们的调查或者与用户交谈，我们知道很多学生实际上认为他们甚至没有机会进入大学，因为他们可能负担不起。但他们肯定有其他选择，比如经济援助之类的。这就是我们想要达到的目标，以确保他们能够获得这些信息，这样他们才能知道自己至少有机会申请大学，或者有资格获得经济援助和途径。

Avichal Garg: I'm just going to echo what Adora is saying, I love what you just said  by the way, that's an awesome mission. When you think about a company and there's  like the mission, there's the vision it's like, "When we achieve the mission here's what  the world will look like." There's the strategy, which is like, here's in the fewest  number of words how we're going to go about achieving our mission and then there's  the tactics, there's the things that you do week over week in pursuit of your  strategy to validate whether that strategy is true or not. I think the advice that  Adora is giving is more like strategic advice where it's like okay great, that's an  awesome mission but where do you start? Or what is the first value that you  create for people and then that lets you create that second value, and that third  value and then you've created all of the value for that population of people, but  where do you start.

阿维夏尔·加格：我只是重复阿多拉的话，我喜欢你刚才说的话，这是一个很棒的任务。当你想到一家公司的时候，就会看到这样的愿景：“当我们完成任务的时候，这就是世界的样子。”这是一种策略，就像，在最少的单词中，我们将如何完成我们的使命，还有战术，你每周都在追求你的策略，以验证这个策略是否正确。我认为阿多拉给出的建议更像是战略建议-好的，这是一个很棒的任务，但你从哪里开始呢？或者你为人们创造的第一个价值是什么，然后让你创造第二个价值，第三个价值，然后你为这些人创造了所有的价值，但你从哪里开始呢？

Adora Cheung: Yeah if you think about if you're going to apply to college there's many steps  in that, and you can't tackle every single step so find the one in which  people are having the most issue with, or they need the most help in which  they will actually pay for as well because you're trying to obviously build a business,  right?
Avichal Garg: And it's not just, sorry to cut you off, but it's not just project strategy,  there's also the go to market strategy which is like, that's a lot of people  right, what is it, how many people, is it like 50% of people even take  the SAT in the US? It's like half the people don't even take the SAT.  So you're talking about large numbers of people at every step of the funnel and  so who you target is also part of your strategy and who you target is  going to be directly tied to what you build for those people as a first  step.

张朵拉：是啊，如果你考虑一下你是否要申请大学，有很多步骤，你不可能解决每一个步骤，所以找出一个人最有问题的步骤，或者他们需要最多的帮助，因为他们也会为此付出代价，因为你显然是在努力建立一家企业，对吗？阿维夏尔·加格：不只是，很抱歉打断了你，这不仅仅是项目策略，还有走向市场的策略，比如，很多人都是对的，到底有多少人，在美国甚至有50%的人参加SAT考试？就像一半的人甚至不参加SAT考试。所以，在漏斗的每一步，你都在谈论大量的人，所以你的目标也是你的战略的一部分，你的目标将直接与你为这些人建立的第一步联系在一起。

Angela: Yeah I think that's a great point and when we first started there were like  many different angles we could target and we want to use that they users data  and the ... We wanted to just ask the users to drive us to which  is the focus. I felt like because the early acquisition is really hard for the  users so I don't have enough people to actually give me feedback on which areas  they want to focus on. Some early indication is school selection and essay, so these  are the two that so far I can identify from major is like science, math,  and business so those are three majors. We have some pieces though, signals that tell  us which way we should go but I know in my hear that going forward  there is some one area that I need to focus on I feel like we  don't have enough data to get there yet.

安琪拉：是的，我认为这是一个很好的观点，当我们第一次开始的时候，有很多不同的角度我们可以瞄准，我们想利用他们的用户，数据和.我们只想让用户开车送我们去，这是我们关注的焦点。我觉得这是因为早期的收购对用户来说真的很难，所以我没有足够的人来给我反馈他们想要关注的领域。一些早期的迹象是学校的选择和论文，所以到目前为止，我能从专业中识别出的两个是科学、数学和商业，所以这是三个专业。不过，我们有一些片段，信号可以告诉我们该走哪条路，但我听说，在未来的某个领域，我需要关注的是，我觉得我们还没有足够的数据来实现这一目标。

Avichal Garg: Yeah well the challenge with data is, this goes back to there's basically two ways  to figure out what you want to build whether it's your market, your go to  market plan your product is the top down which is like you go get a  bunch of data, where are the opportunities, how do you slice the market, we're going  to start here then we're going to go here and we're going to go here.  Or bottoms up which is you build the thing, you put it out there, people  start using it, they're like, "Oh we want this." We move forward. A lot of  software actually bottoms up is great because the early adopters indicate where the world is  headed. You build for them and then the rest of the world kind of catches  up. Social networking was obviously was a great example of that. The challenge is if  people that are the early adopters of your product are not representative of what everybody  else is going to do then you end up building a thing that doesn't actually  work for everybody else and that's I think part of the challenge that you would  have right now if you do that. I suspect the people that are coming to  you are not going to be 100% representative of, like to me it sounds like  two different populations of people that you're talking about. The people who don't know about  financial aid, or maybe are not applying to colleges, or not doing all this kind  of stuff or don't have the support. Versus people who are organically finding this and  care about this stuff a lot to me actually sound like different populations of people.

阿维夏尔·加格：嗯，数据方面的挑战是，基本上有两种方法可以确定你想要建立什么样的市场-不管是你的市场还是你的市场计划-你的产品是自上而下的-就像你得到了一堆数据，哪里有机会，你如何分割市场，然后我们从这里开始我们要去这里，我们要去这里。或者从底部开始-你建造这个东西，你把它放在那里，人们开始使用它，他们说，“哦，我们想要这个。”我们继续前进。许多软件实际上已经触底了，因为早期的采用者指出了世界的走向。你为他们建造，然后世界其他地方就会迎头赶上。显然，社交网络就是一个很好的例子。挑战是，如果你的产品的早期采用者不能代表其他人将要做的事情，那么你最终会构建一个对其他人都不起作用的东西，我认为这是你现在面临的挑战的一部分，如果你这样做的话。我怀疑那些来找你的人不会百分之百地代表你，对我来说，这听起来像是你所说的两种不同的人群。那些不知道经济援助的人，或者不申请大学的人，或者不做所有这些事情的人，或者没有支持的人。相对于那些有机地发现和关心这些东西的人，在我看来，实际上听起来就像不同人群的人。

Adora Cheung: I think we have to finish up but just one last thing, it seems like  a lot of people are coming to you for advice anyway and I might just  start from there and just sit down with all these people and just do it  all day every single day for the next I don't know few weeks and then  see if they're anything common things that people are asking you. Also you have access  to now 60 advisors, you could also sit with them and do the exact same  thing. It's totally not a scalable thing to do in the future but it seems  like to figure out where to start, that's like one way to go about doing  it.

张：我想我们必须完成，但最后一件事，似乎有很多人来寻求你的建议，我可能只是从那里开始，坐下来和这些人坐在一起，在接下来的几个星期里，我不知道每一天都在做这件事，然后看看他们是否是人们问你的什么普通的事情。你也可以接触到现在的60位顾问，你也可以和他们坐在一起，做同样的事情。在未来，这完全不是一件可伸缩的事情，但似乎要想办法从哪里开始，这就像是一种方法。

Angela: Thank you.

安吉拉：谢谢。

Female : Makes sense.

女：说得通。

Sid: Hi I'm Sid.

希德：嗨，我是希德。

Avichal Garg: Sid, Avichal.

Avichal Garg：Sid，Avichal。

Adora Cheung: Hey, Adora.

张朵拉：嗨，阿多拉。

Zack: Hi I'm Zack.

扎克：嗨，我是扎克。

Adora Cheung: Adora.

张朵拉：阿多拉。

Avichal Garg: Avichal, good to meet yeah.

阿维夏尔·加格：阿维夏尔，很高兴认识你。

Adora Cheung: Cool, thanks for coming. What are you working on?
Sid: So I'm Sid and I'm the CEO and confounder of Jambo. At Jambo we are  bringing computer vision and technology to solve the price and cost estimation problem for the  home services market specifically we starting with the moving industry so let's say you are  a consumer and you want to move you want to know how much it's going  to cost you take a video and our technology will identify all the items and  then you get a front an accurate code. This is much better than calling multiple  moving companies, staying on the phone for about half an hour each to get arbitrary  wrong quotes or waiting at home for an onsite estimator to come visit.

张朵拉：太好了，谢谢你能来。你在做什么?希德：所以我是希德，我是詹博的首席执行官，也是个令人困惑的人。在Jambo，我们将计算机视觉和技术引入家庭服务市场来解决价格和成本估算问题，具体来说，我们从移动行业开始，假设你是一个消费者，你想移动，你想知道你拍一段视频要花多少钱，我们的技术会识别所有的项目，然后你会得到一个准确的代码。这比给多家搬家公司打电话要好得多，每个公司在电话上停留大约半个小时，以获得任意错误的报价，或者在家里等待现场评估人员来访。

Adora Cheung: So is this an app?
Zack: Sure. We have multiple channels, we did an MVP pilot with an app. We've also  been working on just having it directly on the webpage of the moving-
Adora Cheung: So say I'm at home, it sounds like I take the app and I'm taking  pictures and I'm sending it to you guys and then you kind of give me  an estimate ASAP essentially. Okay.

张朵拉：那么这是一个应用程序吗？扎克：当然。我们有多个频道，我们用一个应用程序做了一个MVP试点。我们也一直在努力让它直接出现在移动网站的网页上-阿多拉·张：所以说我在家，听起来就像我拿了这个应用程序，我在拍照，我把它发给你们，然后你们给我一个基本的估计。好的。

Zack: Correct. We also have a solution where you can text it to a number, but  it's the same technology-
Adora Cheung: This is more accurate than the, or how what's the percent of accuracy do you  get base on, versus someone coming in.

正确。我们也有一个解决方案，你可以发短信给一个数字，但它是相同的技术-阿多拉张：这比，或如何获得的准确率的百分比，你得到的基础，相对于谁进来。

Sid: So we are targeting the same accuracy so the way we are thinking about it  is today the estimation process takes about a week for you to get a quote  or you get multiple quotes and you don't really understand why a quote is what  it is. Our goal is to give you a complete breakdown on what it is,  and we still have some human labor in the background cleaning up the mistakes the  AI is making so our goal is to reduce the human time to less than  five minutes.

希德：所以我们的目标是相同的准确性，所以我们今天的想法是，估计过程需要大约一个星期的时间才能得到一个报价，或者你得到多个报价，而你并不真正理解为什么一个报价是这样的。我们的目标是给你一个完整的分解它是什么，我们仍然有一些人为的劳动在后台清理人工智能正在犯的错误，所以我们的目标是把人类的时间减少到少于5分钟。

Avichal Garg: Why is it so expensive, or why is it so, take a week to get  a quote? Where are moving tech companies taking so long?
Sid: So one main reason is if you are scheduling an onsite estimator visit, so it  cost a moving company a lot more than $200 per visit and you have to  schedule something, schedule someone to come visit. These guys are able to do two to  three estimates a day so in summer time when it's busy it gets really backed  up. Most companies don't end up actually sending an onsite estimator and they give price  quotes over the phone, our research shows that 90% of this is wrong so consumers  shop around. They don't really understand why a company's quoting what they're quoting. And in  a lot of cases what happens is there are these predatory providers in the market  who take advantage of this price of weakness and they give you a low ball  quote, get your business and on the day of you most specifically they slap you  with last minute fee hikes.

阿维夏尔·加格：为什么这么贵，或者为什么要花一周时间才能得到报价？移动科技公司要花这么长时间？希德：所以，一个主要的原因是，如果你要安排一次现场评估访问，那么一家搬家公司每次要花费200美元以上，你必须安排一些事情，安排一些人来拜访你。这些家伙一天能做两三次估计，所以在夏天的时候，当它很忙的时候，它就会得到真正的备份。大多数公司最终都不会发送现场估值，他们会在电话中给出报价，我们的研究表明，90%的报价都是错误的，所以消费者会四处逛逛。他们不太明白为什么一家公司会引用他们的报价。在很多情况下，市场上有一些掠夺性的供应商，他们利用这种弱势的价格，给你一个低价格的报价，得到你的生意，特别是在你的那一天，他们给你最后一分钟的加价。

Avichal Garg: I see.

我明白了。

Sid: So we want to bring, we want to eliminate all of that.

希德：所以我们想带来，我们想消除所有这些。

Adora Cheung: So once you get the quote are you also doing the moving yourself or are  you selling leads?
Zack: Our strategy is we're working with moving companies to do the estimating for them so  we are not a moving company and our customer is the moving company.

张：那么，一旦你得到报价，你也是自己做移动，还是你在卖引线？扎克：我们的策略是与移动公司合作，为他们做评估，所以我们不是一个移动公司，我们的客户是移动公司。

Adora Cheung: Ah, so you're the white label solution for them.

张：啊，所以你是他们的白标签解决方案。

Zack: Correct, yes.

正确，是的。

Avichal Garg: Why do you need computer vision for this? It seems like everything you described to  me sounds like process failures, transparency, you know market place failures, it sounds like a  bunch of, what does the computer vision give you?
Sid: So our initial MVP that we deployed doesn't have any computer vision, people just take  videos and somebody watches it in the backend and to give a quote that takes  around 19 minutes per person and also you need to hire and scale human work  force to do that and there are a few other companies that's doing this. Our  goal is we eliminate like majority of the work through using CV and keep the  human workload to as less as possible. From a product perspective what we want to  be also able to deliver to consumers is an interactive of them customizing their quote  so let's say you have a a $2,000 budget and moving everything is maybe going  to cost $3,000 then you can decide we can choose however you want to spend  that money.

阿维夏尔·加格：为什么你需要电脑视觉？你对我描述的一切听起来像是过程失败，透明，你知道市场的失败，听起来像一堆，计算机视觉给你什么？希德：所以我们最初部署的MVP没有任何计算机视觉，人们只会拍视频，有人在后台观看，并给出了一个报价，每个人大约需要19分钟，而且你需要雇佣和扩大人力来做到这一点，还有其他一些公司也在这样做。我们的目标是通过使用简历来消除大部分工作，并尽可能地减少人的工作量。从产品的角度来看，我们也想提供给消费者的是他们自定义报价的互动，所以假设你有一个2000美元的预算，移动所有东西可能要花费3000美元，然后你可以决定我们可以选择，无论你想花多少钱。

Adora Cheung: How do you intend to charge for this, and do you have current customers right  now?
Sid: Yeah so we signed our first LOI for a paid trial with a moving company  in San Diego where we are doing this GPM solution where it's $10 with no  AI and $50 with AI. We are talking to multiple large moving companies from 20  million dollars annual revenue to a few billion dollars and we are in the final  stages of negotiations with some of them. On the timeline that's a less of the  features a paid pilot so it's like enterprise level contracts that we're going after.

张朵拉：你打算怎么收费，你现在有现在的客户吗？是的，所以我们和圣地亚哥的一家移动公司签订了我们的第一个LOI，在那里我们正在做这个GPM解决方案，它是10美元没有AI，50美元与AI。我们正在与多家大型移动公司谈判，从每年2000万美元的收入增加到数十亿美元，我们正处于与其中一些公司谈判的最后阶段。在时间线上，这是一个较少的功能，一个付费的试点，所以这就像企业级的合同，我们要追求的。

Adora Cheung: So what is success look like for you, is it accuracy or what are these  folks looking from you?
Sid: Two different things, from a consumer standpoint they want to reduce the friction of, they  want to provide a better quality of service because there's no way for the good  companies to differentiate themselves right now so they are looking at it as a better  way to do customer service and also from a cost standpoint since it costs more  than $200 to send an onsite estimator and it doesn't scale they are looking at  ways to increase their bottom line in their profits.

张朵拉：对你来说，成功是什么样子的，是准确的，还是这些人从你身上看到的？希德：两件不同的事情，从消费者的角度来看，他们想要减少摩擦，他们想提供更好的服务质量，因为好的公司现在没有办法使自己与众不同，所以他们认为这是做客户服务的更好的方式，也是从成本的角度来看，因为发送一份服务的成本超过200美元。在现场评估，它没有规模，他们正在寻找方法，以增加他们的利润底线。

Adora Cheung: I wonder if there's a bigger market in you being the initial, like people thinking  you're the initial moving company or and you're selling the leads. I don't know if  you want to get into the actual moving itself, that seems quite different it's just  operationally a headache but instead part of what you're doing is also acquiring users and  getting that sales process going and making it a great experience and if you do  that really well then why not just own the entire process? The entire sales process?
Sid: That's something that we've considered but moving has a lot more intricacies than just the  quote so eight now we are just hyper focused on generating the best quotes possible,  that's something that we could possibly do in the future. The second point is we're  not acquiring customers today, the moving companies acquire customers themselves so we are a technology  that either they're on the website or direct consumers to a rep.

张朵拉：我想知道你是否有一个更大的市场，你是最初的，就像人们认为你是最初的移动公司，或你出售的线索。我不知道你是否想进入实际的移动本身，这似乎是相当不同的-这只是操作上的一个令人头痛的问题，但相反，你正在做的部分工作是获取用户，并使销售过程进行，并使它成为一个很好的体验，如果你做得真的很好，为什么不直接拥有整个过程呢？整个销售过程？希德：这是我们考虑过的事情，但是移动比仅仅引用更复杂，所以现在我们只专注于产生最好的报价，这是我们将来可能会做的事情。第二点是，我们今天没有获得客户，移动公司自己也获得了客户，所以我们是一种技术，他们要么在网站上，要么直接让消费者找到代表。

Avichal Garg: Why do you charge more for the AI and less for the people?
Sid: So with the $10 solution the assumption is if you are the moving company you  watch the video and provide the quote yourself so there's some human, if you are  the moving company you have to hire people to actually watch the video.

阿维夏尔·加格：为什么你对人工智能收取更多的费用，而为人民收取更少的费用？希德：所以用10美元的解决方案，假设如果你是移动公司，你会看视频，自己提供报价，这样就有了一些人，如果你是搬家公司，你必须雇佣一些人来看视频。

Avichal Garg: Oh so you're not hiring the people to do it.

阿维夏尔·加格：哦，你不是雇人来做这件事的。

Sid: On the $10, no.

希德：十块钱，不行。

Adora Cheung: Who is actually taking the non AI version?
Sid: Right now our AI is not completely ready yet so that's the product that we  are selling right now.

张：谁是真正的非人工智能版本？希德：现在我们的人工智能还没有完全准备好，所以这就是我们现在正在销售的产品。

Adora Cheung: I see but why not sell just the AI, I mean that's what you're going  to be so why not sell the AI product now, you could still have yourselves  in the back-
Avichal Garg: Yeah just fake it.

张阿多拉：我明白了，为什么不只卖人工智能，我的意思是这就是你要做的，为什么不现在就卖人工智能产品，你还可以在后面-阿维夏尔·加格：是啊，假装吧。

Adora Cheung: Yeah fake it till you make it you know?
Sid: So that's a good question so two reasons, the first one is we want to  train our AI on real world, people's homes. You can imagine when you're moving your  house looks nothing like the beautiful catalog pictures-
Adora Cheung: It seems like this is, you need a lot of data and to get a  lot of data really quickly you could just provide this blanket solution and all the  moving companies think they're getting this thing.

张爱多拉：是啊，假装吧，直到你成功为止，你知道吗？希德：这是一个很好的问题，有两个原因，第一个原因是我们想要在现实世界，人们的家园上训练我们的人工智能。你可以想象，当你搬家的时候，你的房子看起来一点也不像漂亮的目录图片-阿多拉·张：看起来，你需要大量的数据，为了快速获取大量的数据，你可以提供这个全面的解决方案，而所有移动的公司都认为他们得到了这个东西。

Sid: Yeah, so-
Adora Cheung: And you're providing the same amount of quality either way right?
Sid: Yeah so we are actually hiring teachers that are old sourced whereas our AI is  improving their workload that's reducing so that's something that we're doing.

希德：是啊，所以-张：而且你提供的质量都是一样的，对吧？希德：是啊，所以我们实际上是在雇佣那些老来源的老师，而我们的人工智能正在改善他们的工作量，这正在减少，所以这是我们正在做的事情。

Adora Cheung: So, homes are very different, which is why it's probably such a big problem no  one has figured out how to standardize the quoting process. How much data do you  think you need before you've gotten something that can just run on its own?
Sid: So we are actively also web scraping for data from Google, Flickr so we have  a few million already downloaded to the goal with AI is the accuracy keeps increasing  with time and as more consumers use it and we have a feel safe mechanism  of humans filling in the gaps in the mean time.

张朵拉：所以，家庭是非常不同的，这可能是一个很大的问题，没有人知道如何规范报价过程。在获得能够独立运行的数据之前，您认为需要多少数据？SID：所以我们也在积极地从Google上抓取数据，Flickr，所以我们已经下载了几百万的数据，人工智能的目标是，随着时间的推移，准确性在不断提高，随着越来越多的消费者使用它，我们有了一种安全的机制，让人类在同一时间填补空白。

Adora Cheung: What is your biggest challenge right now?
Sid: That's a good question, and that's one thing I think start up school has actually  helped us out with so we are going after large interface contracts and it's taking  some time because our AI is not ready yet so we are looking at ways  of how to deploy a solution while simultaneously being can monetize it as well. In  the mean time because of our mentor from start up school we are doing this  GPM solution so that we get our product out the door. We did a non-paid  pilot so this is a way to get some paying customers, so anything that can  reduce the sales process especially as we're going after the enterprise customers will help us  accelerate faster as well as I guess we need to clone ourselves to create a  product that's much accurate and in a shorter period of time.

张朵拉：你现在最大的挑战是什么？希德：这是一个很好的问题，我认为开办学校确实帮助了我们，所以我们正在追求大型的界面合同，这需要一些时间，因为我们的人工智能还没有准备好，所以我们正在研究如何部署一个解决方案，同时也可以将其货币化。同时，由于我们的导师从刚开始的学校，我们正在做这个GPM解决方案，使我们的产品走出大门。我们做了一个无报酬的试点，所以这是吸引一些付费客户的一种方式，所以任何能减少销售过程的东西-尤其是在我们追求企业客户的时候-都会帮助我们加快速度，我想我们需要克隆自己，才能在更短的时间内创造出精确得多的产品。

Adora Cheung: It's generating leads and then, so what does your pipeline look like? How many companies  do you talk to a day?
Zack: Sure so as I mentioned we're targeting initially these larger enterprises because that allows us  to scale faster so we found it's pretty easy to get companies in the funnel  when you explain what you're doing. It's the end of that after you've shown them  the tech, you've shown them the demo and we're ready to sign for a paid  pilot that a lot of folks are saying, "This is great, I need it to  do everything right now." So there's a bit of a gap between where we are  today and where we need to be where we could close them a lot faster,  and that's kind of where we're coming in with these creative ideas of how do  we monetize what we have today and then work towards that goal.

张：这是产生线索，然后，你的管道是什么样子？你一天和多少家公司交谈？Zack：当然，就像我提到的，我们最初针对的是那些规模更大的企业，因为这样我们就可以更快地扩大规模，所以当你解释你在做什么的时候，我们发现让公司进入漏斗是相当容易的。这就结束了，在你给他们看了技术，你给他们看了演示，我们准备签一个付费的飞行员，很多人说，“这很好，我现在需要它来做所有的事情。”所以，在我们现在的状况和我们需要达到的目标之间有一点差距，我们可以更快地将它们关闭，这也是我们正在提出的创造性想法的地方，我们如何将我们今天拥有的东西货币化，然后为实现这个目标而努力。

Avichal Garg: What is that gap exactly? So they want the full AI and just produces a  price quote?
Zack: Correct, yeah. Are you going to expand on this?
Sid: Yeah. You can imagine that we're detecting about 40 objects today, so we need to  scale that to 150 objects. Because we're using video we need to track these objects  across frames, so we understand that this is one chair, even though I'm seeing it  from the fifth-second to the fifteenth-second. So we need to identify the size of the  object, because that contributes to cost as well. So there are multiple things that we  are doing to ... So we are working simultaneously and making progress and all of  these-
Avichal Garg: And are they willing to sign LOI's that say, hey if you have this, we  would give you $10,000 a month?
Sid: Already signed.

阿维夏尔·加格：这个差距到底是什么？因此，他们想要完整的人工智能，而只是产生一个价格报价？没错，是的。你打算就此展开讨论吗？希德：是的。你可以想象，我们今天探测到了大约40个物体，所以我们需要把它放大到150个物体。因为我们使用的是视频，我们需要跨帧跟踪这些物体，所以我们知道这是一张椅子，尽管我从五秒到十五秒都看到了它。所以我们需要确定物体的大小，因为这也会增加成本。所以我们做了很多事情.所以我们同时工作，并且取得了进步-Avichal Garg：他们愿意签LOI‘s，说，嘿，如果你有这个，我们会给你每月1万美元吗？希德：已经签了。

Avichal Garg: I see. And how many of those LOI's do you have?
Sid: So we have more than a half a dozen of LOI's already signed, so we're  still working on the contract dollar amount. With a few customers we are in the  final stages of figuring out what that amount actually is going to be.

我明白了。你有多少个这样的？希德：那么我们已经签了六六多份LOI了，所以我们还在研究合同金额。与少数客户，我们正处于最后阶段，以确定实际数额将是什么。

Avichal Garg: And how are you pricing that? For the ones that you do have signed, how  have you priced it?
Sid: For the first year we are pitching a flat fee, so a few hundred thousand  dollars, where they can use our product as much as they want where we actually  work together with them in refining the process of how consumers actually use that technology  to get a quote.

阿维夏尔·加格：你是怎么定价的？对于你签的书，你是怎么定价的？希德：第一年，我们要收取统一的费用，所以几十万美元，他们可以用我们的产品尽可能多地使用我们的产品，在那里我们和他们一起改进消费者如何使用这种技术来获取报价的过程。

Avichal Garg: I see. So the total contract size or each contract is worth a couple hundred  thousand?
Sid: So we are looking at signing a maximum of up to three in the first  year for a few hundred thousand dollars.

我明白了。那么合同的总规模还是每一份合同的价值是几十万？希德：所以我们打算在第一年以几十万美元的价格最多签下三张。

Avichal Garg: I see. So can you just, to Adora's earlier point, can you just hire two  people to do this full-time and go get a couple hundred thousand dollars from these  guys and say, "hey we've got AI that's as good as a human" because you  literally have a human?
Sid: That's what we're doing. I mean that's our goal once we sign this, but they  also want more, a turnaround time of a few hours, so that's something that we  are working with actually. That's a very good point.

我明白了。所以你能不能，就像阿多拉之前所说的那样，你能雇两个人做这个全职工作然后从这些人那里得到几十万美元然后说，“嘿，我们有一个和人类一样好的人工智能”，因为你真的有一个人类？希德：这就是我们要做的。我的意思是，这是我们的目标，一旦我们签署，但他们也希望更多，一个转机的时间，几个小时，所以这是我们的工作，实际上。这是个很好的观点。

Adora Cheung: What is your turnaround time? I guess you're optimizing for this at this point.

张朵拉：你的周转时间是几点？我想你现在是在为这个做优化。

Sid: Yeah. It depends. We can have a turnaround time as less than one hour. It  just means that we need to make sure that we have someone on-call 24 hours  a day. So we know the NA spits out the analysis, they're able to clean  that.

希德：是的。那得看情况我们可以有不到一个小时的周转时间。这意味着我们需要确保每天24小时都有人随时待命。所以我们知道NA会把分析吐出来，他们就能把它清理干净。

Adora Cheung: You might actually just want to figure out what the labor costs there for now  as you're building up this data and then just price accordingly. So it might not  be ... So right now you're charging $10 or something, $50 and it might right  now due to the labor costs because you don't have all the data and it's  not accurate enough, it might be $100 cost to you, so why not just charge  something a little bit above that? It will knock out a number of people who  won't pay that much, but at least it'll get you going with real customers.

张：你可能只是想知道现在的劳动力成本，因为你正在建立这些数据，然后再相应地定价。所以可能不是.。所以现在你收费10美元左右，50美元，这可能是由于劳动力成本的原因，因为你没有所有的数据，而且它不够准确，对你来说可能是100美元，那么为什么不多收费一点呢？它会击倒许多不愿付那么多钱的人，但至少会让你和真正的顾客一起去。

Sid: So with the large enterprise customers we are pitching a flat rate. So with the  smaller guys we are pitching the $10 and $50 just to get more data through  our pipeline. But maybe that's a good idea.

希德：因此，对于大企业的客户，我们提出了一个统一的价格。因此，与较小的人，我们推出的10美元和50美元，只是为了获得更多的数据，通过我们的管道。但也许这是个好主意。

Adora Cheung: Why are you pitching a flat rate with the big customers?
Sid: Because this is very new to them and we want to make sure that they  are incentivized to use it as much as possible. Pitching on a per use fee  we feel like maybe-
Adora Cheung: Do they already have estimators? Because you're replacing them in some sense down the road  right?
Sid: So I don't think, initially the target is, let's say you have like a five-bedroom  or six-bedroom house, they may still want to send an estimate role. But there's a  significant, maybe 75% of the cases where they don't really send an estimator. So initially  based on our conversations they may start using us for that specific segment of the  market before-
Adora Cheung: This may be getting a little bit into the weeds, but one of the advantages  of sending an estimator is you're also a sales person and so they close the  sale for them. It might be that especially if you're going to a huge house,  that could be a lot of profit for them. They wouldn't even want to just  send it off somewhere else. So maybe as you also, this is a tool for  that estimator right to go faster and they can get to more houses.

张朵拉：你为什么要向大客户推销统一的价格？希德：因为这对他们来说是非常新的，我们希望确保他们被激励尽可能多地使用它。在每次使用费上投球，我们觉得可能-张：他们已经有估值了吗？因为从某种意义上说，你是在取代他们，对吧？希德：所以我不认为，最初的目标是，假设你有一个像五卧室或六卧室的房子，他们可能仍然想要发送一个估计的角色。但有一个重要的，也许75%的情况，他们没有真正发送一个估计。因此，最初根据我们的谈话，他们可能会开始利用我们在市场上的特定部分-阿多拉·张(Adora Cheung)：这可能会让我们有点陷入困境，但派一位估值员的好处之一是，你也是一名销售人员，所以他们为他们结束了销售。这可能是，特别是如果你要去一个巨大的房子，这可能是一个很大的利润，他们。他们甚至不想把它寄到别的地方去。所以也许你也一样，这是一个工具，用来估计更快的速度，他们可以到达更多的房子。

Sid: Yeah that's one of the options that we are working with one of these companies.

希德：是的，这是我们与其中一家公司合作的选择之一。

Adora Cheung: Okay, got it.

张朵拉：好的，明白了。

Avichal Garg: So what does this become? Suppose you're successful, you get a bunch of contracts, then  what happens?
Sid: So again, we started with moving, but we've also found opportunities in other parallel verticals,  like painting and home renovations and so on. Where the data that we are collecting  and the AI that we're training will help us get to our solution faster. Our  goal is solve the problem for one industry and go horizontal to the second industry  and so on.

阿维夏尔·加格：那这会变成什么呢？假设你成功了，你会得到一堆合同，然后会发生什么呢？希德：所以，我们又一次开始搬家，但我们也在其他平行的垂直点上找到了机会，比如绘画和房屋装修等等。我们正在收集的数据和我们正在训练的人工智能将帮助我们更快地找到我们的解决方案。我们的目标是解决一个行业的问题，走向横向的第二产业等等。

Adora Cheung: It seems like something like painting would be easier.

张朵拉：看起来像画画会更容易些。

Avichal Garg: Yeah I was just thinking exactly that.

阿维夏尔·加格：是的，我就是这么想的。

Adora Cheung: Because it's just like square footage almost.

张朵拉：因为它几乎就像面积一样。

Avichal Garg: It sounds like so much easier for them to sell.

阿维夏尔·加格：听起来他们销售起来要容易得多。

Sid: It's actually slightly more difficult because if an on-sight estimator comes to estimate your painting  areas, whether it's like all these furniture that's blocking the views of the walls and  so on. And also getting scale is important in painting, so we need to get  to the square feet level. So we looked at it and then we think that  the moving is an easier problem to solve actually.

希德：这实际上要稍微困难一些，因为如果一个视觉估测器来评估你的绘画区域，是否像所有这些家具挡住了墙壁的视线等等。在绘画中，获得尺度也是很重要的，所以我们需要达到平方尺的水平。所以我们看了它，然后我们认为移动是一个更容易解决的问题。

Avichal Garg: Technically speaking.

阿维夏尔·加格：从技术上讲。

Sid: Technically speaking.

希德：从技术上讲。

Adora Cheung: I think this is such a huge business. If you guys can eventually just solve  the estimation problem, the pricing problem, you've solved 90% of the headache that all these  lead generation, home service lead generation sites.

张朵拉：我认为这是一笔巨大的生意。如果你们最终能解决估算问题，定价问题，你已经解决了90%的头痛，这些领先一代，家庭服务领先发电网站。

Sid: We agree.

希德：我们同意。

Adora Cheung: Yeah, so it's like a billion dollar, this is the next Google potentially right? Yeah,  congrats. You should apply to YC.

张朵拉：是啊，所以它就像10亿美元，这是下一个谷歌，对吗？是的恭喜你。你应该向YC申请。

Sid: Yeah, looking forward to that.

希德：是的，很期待。

Avichal Garg: Good job guys.

干得好伙计们。

Zack: Thank you.

扎克：谢谢。

Avichal Garg: Thanks.

阿维夏尔·加格：谢谢。

Adora Cheung: Hi, Adora, nice to meet you.

张朵拉：嗨，阿多拉，很高兴见到你。

Avichal Garg: Hey, Avichal, good to meet you. So tell us what you do.

嗨，阿维夏尔，很高兴见到你。告诉我们你是做什么的。

Speaker 9: Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah. So we are Alma Base, so what we do  is we help schools build and engage them in the communities. So currently schools have  a problem tracking their alumni once they graduate and alumni experience is very broken. The  moment they graduate, they keep getting this giving solicitation emails and nothing much. So with  Alma Base what happens is you can create a private alumni network where your alumni  can sign up using the universal log ins like Facebook and LinkedIn and then they  can engage with each other for mentorships, for job opportunities, or for signing up for  the reunions and such things. When those alumni are engaging, the schools would get insights  like, all right so how was this particular user engaging, this alumni engaging with our  Facebook page, how many times he has liked us, or how many times he has  commented, also insights so that they can prioritize their alumni and then they can reach  out to the right alumni for different opportunities.

演讲者9：你好。你听得见吗?嗯所以我们是阿尔玛基地，所以我们所做的就是帮助学校在社区中建立并让他们参与进来。因此，目前学校在毕业生毕业后跟踪校友存在问题，校友的经验也非常糟糕。当他们毕业的时候，他们一直收到这样的恳求邮件，什么都没有。因此，在阿尔玛基地，你可以创建一个私人校友网络，在那里，你的校友可以使用Facebook和LinkedIn这样的通用日志注册，然后他们就可以为彼此提供指导、工作机会，或者报名参加聚会之类的活动。当这些校友参与进来的时候，学校会得到这样的见解：好吧，这个特定的用户是如何参与的，这个校友如何参与我们的Facebook页面，他喜欢我们多少次，或者他评论了多少次，也有洞察力，这样他们就可以优先考虑他们的校友，然后他们可以联系到合适的校友，寻找不同的机会。

Adora Cheung: Is this for colleges, high schools?
Speaker 9: And schools, yeah K-12, independent schools, and universities.

张：这是给大学，高中的吗？演讲者9：还有学校，是的K-12，独立学校和大学。

Adora Cheung: Do they all have the same problems in terms of reaching out to alumni?
Speaker 9: Yeah. So universities definitely have a different problem because they are at a different scale,  but schools have a different problem. The biggest problem that the schools have is they  do not have updated alumni data because the moment they graduate-
Adora Cheung: So it's just a basic, like all they need is currently just a basic CRM  and it'd be 100X better than what they have.

张朵拉：他们在联系校友方面都有同样的问题吗？演讲者9：是的。所以大学肯定有不同的问题，因为他们在一个不同的规模，但学校有不同的问题。学校面临的最大问题是，他们没有更新校友数据，因为他们毕业的那一刻-阿多拉·张：所以这只是一个基本问题，就像他们目前所需要的只是一个基本的客户关系管理(CRM)，而且比他们所拥有的要好100倍。

Speaker 9: Kind of. Kind of. But the way that they get the data into the CRM  is by the social media that's the key value that we provide. So the moment  you sign up, we get your profile information from Facebook, education, your employment, your current  location. So if someone has moved from like San Francisco to Boston and they update  it on Facebook it automatically gets synced here. Currently the way schools are tracking it  is by either putting up a Google Form on their alumni tabs on the school  website or by asking them to email or doing phone , which is like-
Adora Cheung: So isn't part of the problem just connection to that person? So once just emailing  them and they actually seeing the email and then converting that person?
Speaker 9: Yeah, but it's quite difficult. Like how many times you have responded to any of  your school emails and then once you get the input from the email, then you  are going to need to put in some other database and you always need to  manually update the database, an Excel spreadsheet or something like that.

演讲者9：算是吧。有点但他们将数据输入CRM的方式是通过社交媒体，这是我们提供的关键价值。所以当你注册的时候，我们会从Facebook，教育，你的工作，你现在的位置得到你的个人资料。因此，如果有人从旧金山搬到波士顿，然后在Facebook上更新，它就会自动在这里同步。目前，学校追踪的方式要么是在校友会网站的校友标签上贴上谷歌表格，要么要求他们发电子邮件或打电话，就像-张：那么，问题的一部分不只是与那个人的联系吗？所以，有一次，只要给他们发电子邮件，他们就会看到这封电子邮件，然后转化成那个人演讲者9：是的，但这很难。就像你已经回复了多少次学校的电子邮件，一旦你收到了电子邮件的输入，你就需要输入一些其他的数据库，你总是需要手动更新数据库、Excel电子表格或类似的东西。

Adora Cheung: Which type of customer are you focused on right now? High schools or colleges?
Speaker 9: High schools, like K-12 high schools.

张朵拉：你现在关注的是哪种类型的客户？高中还是大学？演讲者9：高中，像K-12高中。

Adora Cheung: Interesting.

张朵拉：有意思。

Speaker 9: The independent ones.

演讲者9：独立的。

Avichal Garg: From the end user perspective, why would they want to sign up? They're going to  have a Snap Chat and an Instagram, a Facebook, a What's app, a Facebook messenger,  a phone, an email address, a Slack, and this?
Speaker 9: Yeah I got it. This is something that a lot of people ask me every  day. But in startup school, in our group I just posted to say, how many  of you want to join a new network of your alumni and why do you  want to join? So everyone was like, yeah we want to have the private network  because LinkedIn and Facebook are public networks, but they want to just be in the  close-
Avichal Garg: Why doesn't the Facebook group just solve this?
Speaker 9: The Facebook group doesn't solve it because you cannot actually link to each other for  job opportunities or for mentorships for one thing.

AvichalGarg：从最终用户的角度来看，他们为什么要注册？他们将有一个简单的聊天，一个Instagram，一个Facebook，一个什么的应用程序，一个Facebook的信使，一个电话，一个电子邮件地址，一个Sack，还有这个？演讲者9：是的，我明白了。很多人每天都问我这个问题。但在创业学校，我刚刚在我们的小组里发帖说，你们中有多少人想加入一个新的校友网络，你们为什么要加入？所以每个人都说，是的，我们想拥有一个私人网络，因为LinkedIn和Facebook是公共网络，但是他们想成为封闭的-Avichal Garg：为什么facebook组不直接解决这个问题呢？演讲者9：Facebook小组没有解决这个问题，因为你们不能为了工作机会或一件事的指导而相互联系。

Avichal Garg: What do you mean? Why not?
Speaker 9: Sorry?
Avichal Garg: Why not? Why can't you just message somebody if you're in the same group?
Speaker 9: No, but I mean how many times do you actually get those notifications like, I  turn off a lot of my groups and then each of the groups is like  seven person these days because Facebook really wants to promote ads or something on the  groups, so it's quite difficult in terms of that engagement on Facebook groups.

阿维夏尔·加格：什么意思？为什么不行?演讲者9：对不起？阿维夏尔·加格：为什么不呢？如果你是同一组人，你为什么不直接给别人发个口信呢？演讲者9：不，但我是说，你到底收到了多少次这样的通知，比如，我关掉了我的很多组，现在每个组都像七个人，因为Facebook真的想在群组上推广广告或其他东西，所以在Facebook上的参与是相当困难的。

Avichal Garg: But why wouldn't the same thing ... So if I followed your logic, you basically  said, you could theoretically join a group, then people could reach out to you, they  can like your stuff, they can post a bunch in the group, and Facebook will  notify you because there's stuff happening in the group, that starts to get annoying, so  you turn off the notifications.

阿维夏尔·加格：但为什么不同样的事情.。所以如果我遵循你的逻辑，你基本上会说，理论上你可以加入一个小组，然后人们可以联系你，他们可以喜欢你的东西，他们可以在这个小组里发布一堆，而Facebook会通知你，因为在这个小组里发生了一些事情，这开始很烦人，所以你关掉了通知。

Speaker 9: Exactly.

演讲者9：没错。

Avichal Garg: Why wouldn't the same thing happen for you?
Speaker 9: Yeah so here you can actually, I'll setup different notifications. Like when they're signing up,  we ask them, how do you want to contribute back to your community, is it  by mentorship or is it by providing job sharing opportunities or by giving or volunteering  or planning the reunion? So ask those and based on that they can configure notifications  and they would be getting a digest based on these settings.

阿维夏尔·加格：为什么同样的事情不会发生在你身上？扬声器9：是的，所以在这里你可以，实际上，我将设置不同的通知。比如，当他们注册的时候，我们会问他们，你想如何为你的社区做出贡献，是通过指导，还是通过提供工作分享机会，或者通过提供或志愿服务，或者通过计划聚会？因此，问那些，并基于此，他们可以配置通知，他们将得到一个摘要根据这些设置。

Avichal Garg: I see.

我明白了。

Speaker 9: Yeah. So you wouldn't be getting all the common ones. For example, the class of  1990 is having a reunion and you're in the Stanford group and you're from the  class of 2000 then you actually wouldn't want to see that right. That's an annoyance  for you. It's not relevant for you and the group.

演讲者9：是的。这样你就不会得到所有普通的了。例如，1990年的班级正在重聚，你是斯坦福大学的学生，你来自2000年的班级，所以你实际上不想看到这一点。这对你来说是件烦人的事。与你和团队无关。

Adora Cheung: How many schools do you have currently?
Speaker 9: To be precise, 94.

张：你目前有多少所学校？演讲者9：准确地说，94。

Adora Cheung: And how many per school, alumni per school are on your thing?
Speaker 9: So on average it's 5,000 and it goes to like 15,000 depending upon the boarding  school or the kind of school it is.

张：那么每所学校，每所学校有多少位校友在你身上呢？演讲者9：所以平均是5，000，根据寄宿学校或学校的类型，大约是15，000。

Adora Cheung: 5,000 alumni per school.

张朵拉：每所学校有5，000名校友。

Speaker 9: Per school yeah.

讲者9：每所学校是的。

Adora Cheung: Are on your site.

张：在你的网站上。

Avichal Garg: You have like how many schools?
Speaker 9: Ninety-four.

阿维夏尔·加格：你喜欢多少所学校？演讲者9：94.

Avichal Garg: So you have 450,000 people?
Speaker 9: No, we have our own like a million records, like some schools have more and  we also have signed up some of the universities and of that, like 25 people  have signed up on the platform. Some of them are still have yet to sign  up on the platform.

阿维夏尔·加格：那么你有45万人？演讲者9：不，我们有自己的上百万的记录，就像一些学校有更多的，我们也注册了一些大学，其中有25人已经在这个平台上注册了。他们中的一些人还没有在这个平台上注册。

Adora Cheung: And what are they doing when they sign up to the platform?
Speaker 9: So one thing is the admins, like the alumni relations office, they have different tools  where they can post content and a weekly digest goes. So they come and they  consume this content or they respond to any of the things, like there's a section  called "needs". If someone wants any help they can just post there, so they come  and they respond to this. This is actually the data where at this point in  time or is there any job postings, they just come and apply if they are  looking for job opportunities.

张朵拉：当他们注册站台时，他们在做什么？演讲者9：有一件事是管理员，就像校友关系办公室一样，他们有不同的工具可以发布内容和每周的摘要。所以他们来消费这些内容，或者他们对任何东西都有反应，就像有一个叫做“需求”的部分。如果有人需要任何帮助，他们可以张贴在那里，所以他们来了，他们对此作出回应。这实际上是数据，在这个时候，或是否有任何职位，他们只是来申请，如果他们正在寻找工作机会。

Avichal Garg: Yeah. So if I'm the office that's ... Who's actually buying this? Who's making the  purchase of this?
Speaker 9: The school is buying it.

阿维夏尔·加格：是的。所以如果我是办公室那.。到底是谁在买这个？这是谁买的？演讲者9：学校正在买它。

Avichal Garg: So who inside the school is making the decision?
Speaker 9: Alumni relations office, not the association, but the alumni relations office. So every school has  a development office in which the alumni relations office is a part of, so they  buy it.

阿维夏尔·加格：那么是谁在学校里做出这个决定呢？演讲者9：校友关系办公室，不是协会，而是校友关系办公室。所以每所学校都有一个开发办公室，校友关系办公室是其中的一部分，所以他们买下了。

Avichal Garg: I see. And how are you pricing it for these people?
Speaker 9: Yeah we are pricing ... So we have three different plans, but the pro plan  is something we just a lot of our features, which is $5,000 per year.

我明白了。你是如何为这些人定价的？是的，我们正在定价.所以我们有三种不同的计划，但是PRO计划是我们的很多特色，每年5，000美元。

Avichal Garg: Per year.

Avichal Garg：每年。

Speaker 9: Yeah.

演讲者9：是的。

Adora Cheung: It would seem like one, to get these users it would be right after they  graduate. But two, something, I feel like the missing feature here is something along the  lines of school spirit. I can't articulate it right now, but this is what's not  on ... I'm trying to say is a lot of what you're building is already  on Facebook or these other things and people naturally create these groups actually. Maybe it's  not the entire school, but it's their friend set. Like I'm in a group of  100 people at my high school I think. But what I ... I don't know.  I'm not sure where I'm going to right now, but I think the way to  capture these people and the alumni folks, the administrators, can capture some kind of school  spirit thing where it gets them back to the other site.

张：这似乎是一个，得到这些用户，它将是在他们毕业后。但是第二，有些东西，我觉得这里缺少的特征是某种与学校精神相一致的东西。我现在说不出话来，但这是不对的.我想说的是，你正在建立的很多东西已经在Facebook上或者其他东西上了，人们自然地创建了这些群体。也许不是整个学校，但这是他们的朋友。就像我在我的高中里有100个人一样。但我.。我不知道我不知道我现在要去哪里，但我认为捕获这些人和校友的方法，也就是管理者，可以捕捉到某种学校精神的东西，让他们回到另一个网站。

Speaker 9: Exactly. If you look at it, the reason why you do not want to give  your contact information is because the school is not providing any value to you at  this point of time. But if they could provide some value, hey, there are so  many mentors, if you want any mentorship can you just come here and we'll be  helping you. Then there's a student aspect there. For example, the graduating class, like in  the high schools especially when they're going for their college applications or something, then the  counseling offices in the schools they can just match these people and then help them  get a better counseling regarding their college. So these kind of small things that they  can do at this point of time, which I think is not so structured in  Facebook groups or anything of that sort. The key thing here is the alumni office  can take control of all of this, like what is the active duty which is  happening, which is not possible .

演讲者9：没错。如果你看一下，你不想给你的联系方式的原因是因为学校在这个时候没有为你提供任何价值。但是，如果他们能提供一些价值，嘿，有这么多的导师，如果你想要任何导师，你能来这里，我们会帮助你。还有一个学生方面。例如，毕业班，比如在高中，特别是在他们申请大学的时候，然后学校里的咨询处，他们可以和这些人相匹配，然后帮助他们获得更好的关于他们的大学的咨询服务。所以在这个时候，他们可以做的这些小事情，我认为在Facebook群组或者其他类似的组织中没有这样的结构。这里的关键是校友办公室可以控制所有这一切，比如什么是正在发生的现役，这是不可能的。

Avichal Garg: What does success look like for the alumni office? Like in a year they have  to renew the contract and buy again, how do they decide whether or not to  give you another $5,000?
Speaker 9: So I think it's about the number of alumni that sign up and then the  kind of enrichment that they get in the data. For example, one of the schools,  so they have only like 600 records, but their total alumni is like 8,000 people.  So we also have an invite tool where they can invite folks via Facebook and  LinkedIn, so now they have 1,800 folks in the first six months.

阿维夏尔·加格：校友办公室的成功是什么样子的？就像一年后要续约再买一样，他们又如何决定是否再给你5，000元呢？演讲者9：所以我认为这是关于注册的校友的数量，然后是他们在数据中获得的丰富。例如，其中一所学校，所以他们只有大约600份记录，但他们的校友总数大约有8，000人。所以我们也有一个邀请工具，他们可以通过Facebook和LinkedIn邀请人们，所以现在他们在头六个月里有1800人。

Avichal Garg: So why do they want those records?
Speaker 9: So again, for giving or for knowing the preferences and engaging them better and providing  them more value.

阿维夏尔·加格：那他们为什么要那些唱片？演讲者9：同样，对于给予或知道偏好，让他们更好地参与，并提供更多的价值。

Avichal Garg: It sounds like there's some downstream metric. Let's say I'm the alumni office and I  got all 8,000 records in the database and I'm the principal of that school, do  I just fire the alumni guy. That person's out of a job now because they  got all 8,000 records?
Speaker 9: I think the place where they're going to use it is for example, it's for  mentoring, which is a huge value that we are thinking, but even if the alumni  office are not really, they do not know what are the key metrics, so we  are also trying to help them build those KPIs along the way when they are  working with it.

阿维夏尔·加格：听起来好像有一些下游指标。假设我是校友办公室，数据库里有8000份记录，我是那所学校的校长，我只是炒了那个校友的鱿鱼。那个人现在失业了因为他们拿到了8000张唱片？演讲者9：我认为他们将使用它的地方-例如，它是用来指导的-这是我们正在思考的一个巨大的价值，但是即使校友办公室不是真的，他们也不知道什么是关键指标，所以我们也在努力帮助他们在工作的过程中建立这些KPI。

Adora Cheung: It sounds like the answer would be similar along the lines of donations per alumni  coming in right.

张朵拉：听起来，答案是相似的，就像每位校友得到的捐款一样。

Speaker 9: Yeah that's the end goal. So if you look at a final-
Adora Cheung: So what are the tools ... Then you have to build them these tools right?  So you've got all these people in great. Now how are you going to get  these people to donate?
Speaker 9: How to donate? So we have a fundraising module where you can put different campaigns,  like okay this is the annual campaign, this is a campaign for a particular building,  and then you can make donations on some already, this is in honor of my  son or pet.

演讲者9：是的，这是最终目标。所以如果你看最后一个-阿多拉·张：那么工具是什么.那你就得给他们做这些工具对吧？所以你把这些人都搞得很棒。现在你要怎么让这些人捐款？演讲者9：如何捐赠？因此，我们有一个筹款模块，你可以在那里进行不同的活动，比如，这是年度活动，这是一项针对特定建筑的活动，然后你可以在一些已经捐赠的项目上捐款，这是为了纪念我的儿子或宠物。

Avichal Garg: So if that's the critical thing, like the alumni person is trying to figure out  how to get more donations ultimately, why do all this extra work to try to  get ... Like why not go through their existing channels and help them optimize what  they're already doing?
Speaker 9: Sure. What we have seen is when they are just doing this sole station for  those donations, actually the donation rate has come down. For example, in the schools, it  has actually come down when compared to the alumni, 300 users just donating to nonprofits.  These days they are just donating to cause and not to the schools or anything  of that sort. So what we believe is, the premise or the hypothesis that we  have is engaged alumni would eventually turn out to be donors, so that's why all  of this. So you need to provide value before and then ask them. Don't just  ask them.

阿维夏尔·加格：所以，如果这是关键的事情，就像校友试图想办法最终得到更多的捐款一样，为什么还要做这么多的额外工作来争取.比如，为什么不通过他们现有的渠道，帮助他们优化他们已经在做的事情？演讲者9：当然。我们看到的是，当他们只是为这些捐款做这个唯一的站时，实际上捐赠率已经下降了。例如，在学校里，与校友相比，这一数字实际上有所下降，有300个用户只是向非营利组织捐款。这些天，他们只是为了事业而不是为学校或诸如此类的事情而捐款。所以我们相信，我们已经订婚的前提或者假设最终会变成捐献者，所以这就是为什么所有这些。所以你需要先提供价值，然后再问他们。别只是问他们。

Avichal Garg: I see. And is there data from ... This sort of software has been around  for a long time. I have to imagine. It's effectively CRM software.

我明白了。有没有数据来自.。这种软件已经存在很长时间了。我不得不想象。这是有效的CRM软件。

Speaker 9: Yeah on the backend yeah.

扬声器9：是的，在后端，是的。

Avichal Garg: But I get emails all the time from organizations that I've been involved with that  try to engage me and have programs. Is there data that says yes if you  engage your alumni they will actually donate more?
Speaker 9: Not yet. I mean we have been for 18 months.

阿维夏尔·加格：但我一直收到来自我参与过的组织的电子邮件，试着让我参与进来，并有项目。是否有数据表明是的，如果你聘请你的校友，他们实际上会捐赠更多吗？演讲者9：还没有。我是说我们已经待了18个月了。

Avichal Garg: No, no, from other software. There's mailing lists right, so are people who are responding  to mailing lists more likely to donate?
Speaker 9: That's what the schools say at least. We have been ... I asked them, who  are your current donors, so they say, yeah these are like alumni who are engaged  or who are teaching or who come here for guest lectures or who regularly respond  to our emails. But we do not know the exact numbers, but that's what we  get a sense of.

阿维夏尔·加格：不，来自其他软件。邮件列表是正确的，那么回复邮件列表的人更有可能捐赠吗？演讲者9：至少学校是这么说的。我们一直.。我问他们，你们现在的捐款者是谁，所以他们说，是的，他们就像那些已经订婚的校友，他们在教书，他们来这里做客座讲座，或者定期回复我们的电子邮件。但我们不知道确切的数字，但这就是我们所理解的。

Avichal Garg: Interesting.

阿维夏尔·加格：有意思。

Adora Cheung: Is there a reason why you started with high school versus colleges? Because it seems  like colleges have much bigger budgets for this. In fact they have entire offices for  this. And then the alumni have more money to donate.

张朵拉：你为什么要从高中开始，而不是从大学开始呢？因为看起来大学在这方面的预算要大得多。事实上他们有整个办公室。然后校友们有更多的钱去捐赠。

Speaker 9: Sure. Sure. So is with the schools. Surprisingly, so is with the schools. But the  reason why, we initially went behind colleges, but then the sale cycles were really long.  There is a lot of donation making process and then the procurement process and some  building system in some universities.

演讲者9：当然。好的学校也是。令人惊讶的是，学校也是如此。但原因是，我们最初落后于大学，但销售周期真的很长。在一些高校中，存在着大量的捐赠过程，然后是采购流程和一些建设体系。

Adora Cheung: But if that's where all the money's at.

张：但是如果钱都在那里的话。

Speaker 9: Yeah we'll eventually go there. We'll eventually go. Like one, several times, so we are  just doing.

演讲者9：是的，我们最终会去那里。我们最终会走的。就像一次，几次，所以我们只是在做。

Adora Cheung: But I think the tools you build for high school alumni administration are much different  than the college ones.

张：但是我认为你为高中校友管理建立的工具和大学的工具有很大的不同。

Speaker 9: Eventually. Yes, so we are-
Adora Cheung: I think what we're suggesting is-
Speaker 9: Go to just the high schools?
Adora Cheung: Well-
Speaker 9: Universities and not the high schools?
Adora Cheung: We talked to you for 10 minutes, so I wouldn't pivot the entire thing right  now, but I would really think hard about the market opportunity between high school and  college.

演讲者9：最终。是的，所以我们是-阿多拉·张：我想我们建议的是-议长9：去高中吗？张朵拉：好吧，议长9：大学而不是高中？张朵拉：我们和你谈了10分钟，所以我现在不会把整件事都说清楚，但我真的会认真考虑高中和大学之间的市场机会。

Speaker 9: No. I agree that the market opportunity is huge with universities. Just the pure paperback  math says that. But the only thing is, it's a lot more sale cycle and  it's just stagnating with growth at this point of time, but with the schools they're  eventually two people in an office. If you both agree to buy it, you just  buy it. But in a university, you are the alumni relations director, and you are  a second director and you both agree, now we need to go to the development  director and then you need to go to the VP of advancement, the institutional advancement  and then the procurement office.

演讲者9：没有。我同意大学的市场机会是巨大的。纯平装本的数学就是这么说的。但唯一的问题是，这是一个更多的销售周期，它只是停滞的增长在这个时候，但与学校，他们最终是两个人在一个办公室。如果你们都同意买，那就买吧。但是在一所大学里，你们是校友关系主任，你们是第二任主任，你们都同意，现在我们需要去找发展主任，然后你们需要去找晋升副总裁，机构进步，然后是采购办公室。

Adora Cheung: Yeah, but once you figure out that sales price process, I know it's difficult, but  once you figure out, it's probably similar in all colleges. Then you just optimize that  and get really good at it, and then people will start coming in faster right.  But it is a pain to get it setup.

张：是的，但是一旦你知道了销售价格的过程，我知道这很困难，但是一旦你知道了，在所有的大学里，这可能是相似的。然后你只需优化它，并使它变得非常好，然后人们就会开始更快地进入，对吧。但是要设置它是件很痛苦的事。

Speaker 9: Yeah. So what we have seen is like for example, there are other players in  this market. So we have, we are just tracking of what rate they are also  closing the higher ed if they are selling the higher ed and we are talking  to a few people. So they say it's eventually how much ever, I don't know  whether they have really cracked the process, but they have nine to 12 month sales  cycles. It's a long relationship building process. They initially need to meet the champion, then  they need to echo with them. It's really, really long sales process.

演讲者9：是的。所以我们看到的是，例如，在这个市场上还有其他的参与者。因此，我们只是在追踪，如果他们出售较高的ED，我们正在和几个人交谈，他们的收盘价是多少。所以他们说，这最终是多少，我不知道他们是否真的破解了这个过程，但他们有9到12个月的销售周期。这是一个漫长的建立关系的过程。他们首先需要见到冠军，然后才需要与他们共鸣。这是一个非常长的销售过程。

Avichal Garg: No, I mean, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. I think the  risk really is that you end up, the thing that you want for high school  is actually very different than the thing you want for colleges.

阿维夏尔·加格：不，我是说，这是有道理的。这很有道理。我认为真正的风险是，你最终想要的高中的东西实际上和你想要的大学的东西是非常不同的。

Speaker 9: Sure.

演讲者9：当然。

Avichal Garg: And so actually you have now built a product for this market that can't go  to the more valuable market. You end up in this niche that is great because  it was faster to win that niche, but it doesn't translate to the bigger, more  valuable niches like the risk that you run with that strategy.

阿维夏尔·加格：实际上，你现在已经为这个市场建立了一个产品，它不能进入更有价值的市场。你最终在这个利基上很棒，因为它能更快地赢得这个利基，但它并不能转化为更大、更有价值的利基，比如你用这个策略运行的风险。

Speaker 9: No, true, but there is a slight overlap in the kind of tools that we  are building. So I feel that once we get some insights here and then we  also have a couple universities I think eight universities currently using us. So based on  those insights, we are keeping a close eye on them, and depending on that, once  we build enough success stories with them, like a case study, then we have a  much better social group, which might be helpful in optimizing the sales process.

演讲者9：不，没错，但是我们正在构建的工具有一些重叠之处。所以我觉得，一旦我们有了一些见解，然后我们也有了几所大学，我想现在有八所大学在使用我们。因此，基于这些观点，我们正在密切关注它们，根据这些，一旦我们用它们建立起足够多的成功案例，比如一个案例研究，那么我们就有了一个更好的社会群体，这可能有助于优化销售流程。

Adora Cheung: You might want to start, I think this is what Avichal was getting at earlier  is, the people at the colleges, they already have a system in place, Millingless Marketing  campaigns and stuff like that. Maybe you don't initially replace all of it, but maybe  talk to a bunch of these people and maybe you can build tools to help  them do something. I don't know what it is, but something better. And then start  from there. It wouldn't cost as much, but it gets you in the door.

张：你可能想要开始，我想这就是Avichal早些时候得到的，大学里的人，他们已经有了一个系统，无磨坊营销活动之类的。也许你一开始并没有把它全部替换掉，但是也许你可以和一群这样的人交谈，也许你可以建立一些工具来帮助他们做一些事情。我不知道是什么，但更好的东西。然后从那里开始。它不会花那么多钱，但它会让你进门。

Speaker 9: Sure. Sure. Yeah.

演讲者9：当然。好的嗯

Avichal Garg: Sorry, but the other big thing, everything that you're saying makes a lot of sense  in the near term. If you look at, there's this great story it's like the  very first banner ad on the internet had like a 73% click through rate or  something insane just because nobody had ever seen a banner ad. They were like, "what  is that" and everybody clicked on it and obviously people don't click on banner ads  anymore. I'm sure when notifications had crazy CTR and they still have actually surprisingly good  CTR. So the risk you actually run is by trying to build your own distribution  channel that you end up having the same thing happen to you a couple of  years from now and then you're in a tough spot. When actually to me, it  sounds like you articulated it really well is the crux of what you want to  do is help these people raise more money. The channel is just the means to  helping them raise the money. Another way to attack it is like, okay well if  you want to raise money, what are the 10 things I could build for you  that would just raise the money, rather than needing the channel to raise the money,  which is just one tactic to get there.

阿维夏尔·加格：对不起，但另一件大事，你说的每句话在短期内都很有意义。如果你看，有一个伟大的故事-就像互联网上的第一个横幅广告，有73%的点击率，或者是一些疯狂的东西，仅仅因为没人看过横幅广告。他们说，“那是什么”，每个人都点击它，显然人们不再点击横幅广告了。我确信，当通知有疯狂的CTR和他们仍然有实际上令人惊讶的好CTR。所以你真正面临的风险是尝试建立你自己的分销渠道，这样你就会在几年后同样的事情发生在你身上，然后你就会陷入困境。实际上，在我看来，你说得很清楚，这是你想要做的关键，就是帮助这些人筹集更多的钱。渠道只是帮助他们筹集资金的手段。另一种攻击方式是，好吧，如果你想筹到钱，我能为你做的10件事是什么，只需要筹集资金，而不需要渠道来筹集资金，这只是一种达到目的策略。

Speaker 9: Sure. So like a pilot, so what I'm doing is I'm volunteering with one of  our customers in the Bay Area school who is doing this specific fundraising campaign. So  we are building some tools for them to understand that exact problem. What of these  tools are required, if at all, we need to just only sell the fundraising aspect.  Give it for free and maybe take a cut, which makes the donation making process  very easy. So we're volunteering and kind of working and feeling out what is there.  We're still in fundraising.

演讲者9：当然。就像一个飞行员，所以我现在做的是和我们在湾区学校的一位客户一起做义工，他正在做这个特别的筹款活动。因此，我们正在为他们建立一些工具来理解这个确切的问题。这些工具中有哪些是必需的，如果有的话，我们只需要出售筹款方面的东西。免费给它，也许可以剪掉它，这使得捐赠过程非常容易。所以我们做义工，工作，感觉那里有什么。我们还在筹款。

Avichal Garg: Yeah. Maybe to put it a slightly different way. It seems like there are already  a lot of channels out there between mail, email, Facebook, LinkedIn, whatever, messengers, text, and  building yet another channel creates a lot of product risk for you, but actually just  helping them raise the money better through the channels that they're already trying to manage  would be a different way to approach it. You might be actually go after a  much bigger market.

阿维夏尔·加格：是的。或许可以用一种稍微不同的方式。看起来，邮件、电子邮件、Facebook、LinkedIn、任何其他渠道、信使、短信和另一个渠道之间已经有很多渠道，这给你带来了很大的产品风险，但实际上，通过他们已经在努力管理的渠道帮助他们更好地筹集资金，将是另一种方式。你可能实际上是在追求一个更大的市场。

Speaker 9: Sure. Actually I have, I think that's the biggest challenge that we are facing also.  Initially we built these tools for the alumni relations office where in the backend they  can do all of this because they are the ones who's making the purchase at  the end of the day. So they need to immediately see that instant gratification of  improving their work. But getting the alumni to sign up is a big challenge, like  you were mentioning. So yeah, that's a big product challenge that we have.

演讲者9：当然。事实上，我认为这也是我们面临的最大挑战。最初，我们为校友关系办公室建立了这些工具，在后台，他们可以完成所有这些工作，因为他们是在一天结束时进行购买的人。因此，他们需要立即看到改进工作的即时满足感。但让校友报名是一个很大的挑战，就像你刚才提到的那样。所以是的，这是我们面临的一个巨大的产品挑战。

Avichal Garg: Like I could imagine literally, if you just made it easy, some of the places  I donate, you click through on the link and you're like, wow I'm trying to  give you money and you're making it so hard. I can't donate on my phone.  Forms and they don't fill in properly and then they validate improperly from the job  descript. I'm trying to give you money, why is this so hard?
Speaker 9: Yeah.

阿维夏尔·加格：就像我可以想象的那样，如果你只是简单地做了一些我捐赠的地方，你点击链接，你就会想，哇，我想给你钱，而你却让它变得如此艰难。我不能在手机上捐款。表格，他们没有正确填写，然后他们不正确地验证从工作描述。我想给你钱，为什么这么难？演讲者9：是的。

Avichal Garg: I can imagine literally you would just, the alumni office would be so happy if  their conversion went from 5% to 12%, they would just make more money.

阿维夏尔·加格：我可以想象，如果他们的转化率从5%提高到12%，他们就会赚更多的钱。

Speaker 9: Yeah exactly. Yeah that's what we are trying.

演讲者9：是的。是的，这就是我们正在尝试的。

Adora Cheung: Great. Cool. I think that's it.

张朵拉：太好了。凉爽的我想就是这样。

Speaker 9: Sure.

演讲者9：当然。

Adora Cheung: Thanks so much.

张朵拉：非常感谢。

Avichal Garg: Thank you. Good job. Yeah sure. If you guys have any questions, open Q&A. Any  questions? No?
Speaker 9: Yeah I had a question.

阿维夏尔·加格：谢谢。做得好!当然可以。如果你们有任何问题，打开问答，有什么问题吗？否演讲者9：是的，我有个问题。

Avichal Garg: Yeah ask, go ahead.

阿维夏尔·加格：是啊，问吧，说吧。

Speaker 9: Yeah, so one of the challenges we face is for example, we have international founders,  there are . So we are not able to get close to our users. So  what is the generic advice in terms of in that situation how do you actually  get to understand your users better?
Avichal Garg: Why are you not able to get to your users?
Speaker 9: So-
Avichal Garg: You're here right now right?
Speaker 9: Yeah, but after a point of time I need to again travel back and then  again come. So we are like switching our roles, like three co-founders, so each of  us come at different times and then we stay and then we work with the  schools. But that has been an ongoing challenge for us.

演讲者9：是的，所以我们面临的挑战之一是，例如，我们有国际创办人，有。因此，我们无法接近我们的用户。那么，在这种情况下，一般的建议是什么呢？如何才能更好地理解用户呢？阿维夏尔·加格：为什么你不能接触到你的用户？演讲者9：所以-Avichal Garg：你现在这里，对吗？演讲者9：是的，但是过了一段时间，我需要再旅行一次，然后再来。所以我们就像转换角色，就像三位联合创始人，所以我们每个人都会在不同的时间来，然后留下来，然后和学校一起工作。但这对我们来说是一个持续的挑战。

Adora Cheung: I think, are you at based, where are you based?
Speaker 9: Here in Mountainview.

张朵拉：我想，你在基地吗，你在哪里？演讲者9：这里在山景城。

Adora Cheung: Mountainview. And who are your users that are elsewhere?
Speaker 9: So there are different schools right. So the schools in the Bay Area.

张朵拉：山景。你的其他用户是谁？演讲者9：所以有不同的学校是对的。海湾地区的学校。

Adora Cheung: So-
Speaker 9: They're from different states, sorry.

张朵拉：所以-议长9：他们来自不同的州，对不起。

Adora Cheung: Oh I see, okay. Well I mean, I think you should ... The main thing  is establishing a relationship with these folks and so sitting down with them for a  little bit, for I don't know, a day or a week and get the workflow  going is one way to do it. Then obviously you can't be everywhere at once,  but I think you can build a lot of product and you don't have to  be right next to them.

张朵拉：哦，我明白了，好吧。我是说我觉得你应该.。主要的事情是和这些人建立关系，然后和他们一起坐一会儿，因为我不知道，一天或一周，让工作流程开始运作是一种方法。那么很明显，你不可能一下子无所不在，但我认为你可以制造出很多产品，你也不必紧跟在他们旁边。

Avichal Garg: I think there's like two general classes of way to do this. There's a qualitative  and there's a quantitative. On the qualitative you can, there's all different scales. You can  literally have, there's one-on-one studies that you're doing with users, you can have a forum  that you create online, there's user feedback software that will give you a bunch of  good qualitative feedback and as people upload something it gives you some signal. I've seen  companies use what they would call like a client counsel. What you do is you  take like a representative sample of 12-15 people, you bring them in once a quarter,  once every six months, you show them new stuff, they're NDA'd, they talk through it,  they give you qualitative feedback and it's like a very targeted way to do this  all in one sitting. And then there's all the quantitative stuff. So there's all these  metrics. Ultimately your KPI's and there's only really four classes of metrics. There's like how  many people use your stuff, how deeply do they use your stuff, how good is  it at doing the thing that you say it's supposed to do, and how much  money do you make? And all of your metrics basically roll into those four. When  you're building features you're just mapping against those things and you see whether those numbers  move. So between those two you should be able to triangulate whether or not a  thing is working.

阿维夏尔·加格：我认为有两种一般的方法可以做到这一点。有定性的，也有定量的。在质量上，你可以有不同的尺度。你可以有，你和用户进行的一对一的研究，你可以在网上创建一个论坛，还有用户反馈软件，它会给你一堆很好的定性反馈，当人们上传一些东西时，它会给你一些信号。我见过公司像客户律师一样使用他们所称的东西。你所做的就是像一个有代表性的12到15人的样本，你每季度带他们来一次，每六个月一次，你给他们看新的东西，他们是NDA的，他们通过它，他们给你定性的反馈，这是一种非常有针对性的方法，在一次会议中做到这一切。然后是定量的东西。所以有所有这些指标。最终，您的KPI只有四类度量标准。就像有多少人使用你的东西，他们使用你的东西有多深，它在做你说应该做的事情上有多好，你赚了多少钱？你的所有指标基本上都是这四个指标。当你在构建特征的时候，你只是在映射那些东西，你会看到这些数字是否移动。因此，在这两者之间，你应该能够判断一件东西是否起作用。

Speaker 9: Thank you.

演讲者9：谢谢。

Avichal Garg: We have more time? We're out of time.

我们还有更多的时间吗？我们没时间了。

Speaker 1: I think that's it.

演讲者1：我想就是这样了。

Avichal Garg: That's it. Cool. Thanks guys.


阿维夏尔·加格：就是这样。凉爽的谢谢各位。
