# Diversity & Inclusion at Early Stage Startups

Kat: I started at YC in 2013, as YCs first director of outreach. That meant outreach  to potential applicants. People who were starting companies so basically people like you. When I  started at YC we had grown totally organically up until that point. That meant that  most of the people applying to YC had heard about YC through Paul Graham's essays,  through reading Jessica Livingston's book, or because they were Hacker News readers. Hacker News started  out as a reddit for tech and startup news, but if you've ever read the  comments it might not shock you to realize that most of the Hacker News community  is male, and if I had to guess even though we don't have those specific  demographics I would guess white male. Basically, I was tasked, I realized and I think  Paul and Jessica realized also that there are smart hard-working people all over the world  who should be starting startups who weren't users of Hacker News.

I was tasked with  figuring out where are these smart and hardworking people and how do we get them  to consider applying to YC. How do we get them to consider starting a company  if they hadn't started already? One of the things I end up working a lot  on at YC is finding ways to recruit founders and from what is typically underrepresented  communities in tech. Then I also think a lot about what do we do to  support those communities once they're here, once they're starting companies, once they're in Silicon Valley.  To be honest, I was not super aware of the particular challenges that a lot  of women and people of color face in tech when I started in 2013.

In  2012, I know the big mantra, the big thing everyone said is tech is a  meritocracy.

I wanted to believe that.

I wanted to believe.

In my, and I have  been personally very, very lucky I'm to work in an environment that is very supportive  of me. Working at YC for example with Paul and just get first then with  Sam. The other partners I was really lucky that they took a chance on me.  That they give me a lot of autonomy and a lot of opportunity to do  great work, but even in a place where I think I have had like a  pretty great experience, I've had moments and I've had experiences that make me wonder whether  my life, whether my job would have been easier if I were a man.

I've  struggled with a lot of anxiety about am I meant to be here? Am I  qualified for this job? There are certain experiences for example not so long ago, there  was a founder for example who had a meltdown. He had a meltdown about something  that frankly, I or none of the partners had any control over, and frankly, he  didn't have any control over it either. What does he do? He calls me and  he yells. He starts yelling, uncontrollably, and as I'm on the phone with this founder  I'm thinking, "Why am I the target for this? I don't see him yelling at  other partners.

I don't see him yelling at other male partners." It just really bothered  me.

It really set me back for a little while. Frankly, in the work that  I do with the founders that is what really makes me realize that we have  such a long way to go. For example, just in the last batch, I had  founders tell me stories about being asked out on dates by customers or by investors.  We had one woman who was told by an investor that she needed to find  a white male co-founder to pitch for her. We had one woman at demo day,  she was a non-profit founder who an investor came up, and said, "Hey, I'll give  you $2000 if you babysit my kids." I'm like, "What the fuck?" I think what  strikes me is that we are living in 2017. We are living in one of  the most liberal places, most progressive places in the United States if not the world.  What I believe is that we have an opportunity here to do better.

I'm excited  for you because I think that one of the things that's most exciting is that  you have this opportunity to build a culture from scratch. Companies are basically like their  own countries. You have the opportunity to build the world that you want to live  in. Some of the best founders I've worked with are ambitious. They're idealistic. They sign  up to solve these big problems because they see that they're unsatisfied with something they  see in the world. They think like, "Hey, I can, I have the opportunity here  to make real change." You end up creating an ecosystem with its own rules, its  own structure, and its own culture. That will be modeled based on your personality and  your beliefs as founders. When Sam asked me to host this workshop I realized that  YC doesn't have a playbook. We don't have a playbook that we just go to  that walks early-stage companies through how to think about D&I issues, but if you paid  any attention to the tech news in the past few years you've realized that there's  a momentum building up around the conversations around D&I, and basically, I think you all  realize at this point as I have that most companies really feel and wish that  they had thought about this stuff earlier on in the life cycles of their company.  What I decided to do was I decided to talk to as many YC companies  as possible.

I wanted to find out how they thought about D&I at their companies?  Why it was important to them? I want to figure out what was working? What  was exciting them about the space? I think most importantly perhaps what is not working?  I brought six of the people here today that I thought I had the most  interesting and thoughtful conversations with. They're going to share their stories and observations with you.  The folks up here I believe will have basically enough knowledge in this space to  fill a book, but for today we have pretty simple goals. First, we want to  better define what diversity and inclusion are.

I think the words are so overused these  days especially in the media that they become a little empty. We’ll talk briefly about  how we define each of these terms in this context. Next, we'll talk about why  D&I was important for these companies to think about, and when they started thinking about  it. A little bit about why you should think about it right now even at  the very earliest stages. Then, finally, we want to talk about how to build a  culture that embraces hard conversations. Diversity and inclusion even for me as a woman and  as a person of color can feel like really scary and awkward topics.

I have  a lot of anxiety about offending or angering other people. That's what scares and stresses  me out the most, but I also realize that having these hard conversations with your  co-founders and with the folks at work with you. These are some of the most  important conversations to have. Many of you today and many of you watching are pre-hiring.  We're not going to get into the nitty-gritty of things like writing job descriptions or  how to conduct interviews because I will, but I will share a page of resources  for you that you can reference when you're ready for that stage. Today I think  we'll talk about things that you can bake into your culture from day one that  will help you lay the foundation of building a company where everyone is set up  to do their best work. Hopefully, you'll leave here today with at least one thing  that you feel excited and like prepared to try to implement or try out. Really  quickly, diversity and inclusion. These are broad concepts. They're going to mean different things to  different companies, different companies into different people. One of my favorite definitions that I've heard  is by , who is a lawyer who does a lot of D&I consulting for  the legal world. She describes diversity as being invited to the party whereas inclusion is  being asked to dance. Diversity in this context I think will relate to finding and  hiring people from a range of backgrounds. What diversity is not is a code word  for gender or race. Diversity I think can mean a lot of things.

It can  mean different academic backgrounds.

It can mean different ages, national origins, religions, work experiences, perspectives.  It's going to be up to you to decide what diversity means for your company  and what you'd like to focus on first, and what you decide to focus on  first is going to change.

It's going to change depending on certain factors.

It might  depend on where your company is based and what the demographics are like in that  region.

It might depend on your product. What is going to be important? If you  want to build a diverse team you have to think about it deliberately because one  trap that happens is that people focus on hiring individuals. What happens is you come  up with a template in your mind for what an ideal employee would look like.  Then suddenly, you have a homogenous team. Many of the alumni I've talked to who  are doing this really well have said they've had to stretch themselves, they've had to  think about hiring a team. Basically, like every … A great team won't all have  the same strengths and weaknesses. The individuals won't have the same strengths and weaknesses. They  will have skills that complement each other, and if you think about it in your,  some of your context, if you're trying to choose a co-founder, for example, you wouldn't  want to work with a clone of yourself. You would ideally want to work with  someone who had complementary skills. Let's see. Moving on to inclusion. Let's see. Sorry. Most  founders I talked to say that after a fundraising the ongoing hardest part of their  job is hiring.

It's hiring great talent, but one thing that a people related challenge  that is less talked about is retaining. How do you get great talent to stay  at your company? You can do the work to recruit talent but if your culture  is garbage they're probably not going to stay for very long. The Center just released  a tech Lever survey which talks about why people voluntarily leave their jobs in tech.  I recommend you read the whole thing.

It's really interesting.

It's not incredibly long. These  are just four main takeaways. As the Center has laid out in their study this  is a huge problem.

It's a very expensive problem for tech. They've seen that D&I  initiatives if done right can improve culture and really reduce turnover. Jen from lab review  you'll meet soon was talking about like what does the flip side look like? There's  a lot of these like terrible cases of what happens when you don't think about  culture early, but if you do build a culture that is great. What do you  get? You get a place where people have strong personal bonds. They are loyal to  your mission. They stay a long time. Lever, I've been specifically really impressed with. They  are at about a 100 employees. They have a 50/50 percent gender split.

I hope  when Jen gets up here today she talks a little bit more about the positive  benefits that she's seen at Lever as a result of them having thought about culture  and inclusion from a very, very early stage.

In all my conversations with YC alumni,  the thing I heard repeated over and over again is that inclusion is just one  aspect of building a great culture from scratch.

Inclusion is really about building a culture  where everyone can feel safe and where people don't have to shy away from having  these like really tough and awkward sometimes conversations. We'll talk about some of those ways  that companies are tackling that challenge on the panel, but first, let's talk really briefly  about why you might even want to start thinking about this right now. There's a  great McKinsey study that came out in 2015 that I included in the resources doc.  That I suggest you read, but here are some thoughts from YC alumni. Porter Braswell  is the founder of a company called Jopwell. They connect black and Latin, and Native  American people with jobs. He described why it's important in this way. How can you  build world-changing products or services if you don't have a complete understanding of the different  perspectives that exist in the world? The founders of ExVivo, another company, YC company learned  this the hard way. They said, "We figured out early that if we hired people  who came from the same academic background they approach problems in the same way." ExVivo  brought up a really great example to illustrate that point.

I want to like do  a quick experiment here. How many of you keep your ketchup in the fridge, in  the refrigerator? How many of you keep your ketchup in the cupboard? Whoa! There's a  great episode of the podcast reply-all where they interview Scott Paige, who's a professor at  the University of Michigan who studies teens. Scot says that language, age, geography, personal hardship  that is all going to influence how we solve problems. He gave this example of  where you keep your ketchup.

It turns out after he did the study if you  are British or African-American from the south there's a strong probability that you will keep  your ketchup in the cupboard.

If you are not either of those things there's a  strong probability that you will keep your ketchup in the fridge. You might think like,  "Why does this matter? Like this seems like a really trivial point." What happens if  you run out of ketchup? If you are a ketchup in the fridge person you  open the fridge, and you might replace it with the things that are next to  the ketchup in the fridge, which are usually mustard or mayo, but if you are  a ketchup in the cupboard person you might open the cupboard and realize, "I'm out  of ketchup." You might put malt vinegar on your fries.

I love that example because  basically, it showcases that like the more diverse backgrounds you have represented, the more associations  you get, the more ways that you can, you have more pathways to solving problems.  Honestly, before hearing the study I had no idea that humans even put their ketchup  in the cupboard.

I didn't know people like that existed.

I was like, "Wow! This  is blowing my mind." Anyway recruiting might not be something that you're thinking about right  now, but inclusion is in the words of Makinde, who you'll meet very brief in  a couple minutes.

Inclusion is something you can tank early on. There are really well-known  stories about what happens when you don't start thinking about this at an early stage.  There is issues with the ride-sharing company, who will not be named, but let's also  talk about Airbnb. Last year at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech Conference, the founder of Airbnb  Brian Chesky was talking about how they were struggling with claims that Airbnb enabled discrimination,  especially against the African-American community. He admitted he was like, "I think we were late  to this issue." He said, "You know, we realized that when we were building a  platform we were three white guys, Joe, Nate, Brian." He said, "That there were a  lot of things we didn't think about." There were a lot of steps that they're  having to reevaluate now, and so, now that we've talked briefly about D&I, how to  define it? Why you might want to think about it? I would love to invite  the panel up to share their stories and observations and have them introduce themselves as  well. Let's bring you, guys, up. Thank you, Steven.


Speaker 2: Oh, no, I'm not … some will be sharing the mic because …
Kat: Yeah. You can just pass them and … Is this awkward if I'm standing? Is  it okay? Okay.

I would love you to go down the line and introduce your  name, your company, your role, and how big your company is today.


Ashu: Sure. My name is Ashu.

I'm one of the co-founders of MakeSchool. We're building a  college for computer science. The company is about 25 people. Me and my co-founder are  co-CEOs.


Jen: Hi. My name is Jen.

I was an early employee at Lever. We build hiring  software.

If you've applied for a job or an internship in the last year or  two, you've probably a used Lever before. As for my role, I've had various roles  building and leading teams in our product, customer success, recruiting and employee experience functions. We're  over a 100.


Kat: They're at 50/50 gender split which is … Yeah.

I remember things but I was,  it's hard to do.


Cristina C.: Hi.

I'm Cristina Cordova.

I manage the partnerships team at Stripe. Stripe builds tools and  infrastructure to accept payments for online businesses. We are about 750 people.

I also spend  a significant amount of my time on our diversity inclusion initiatives.


Cat Perez: I think I have a mic here. Can you, guys, hear me?
Kat: All right.


Cat Perez: My name is Cat Perez.

I am the co-founder and CPO at HealthSherpa. We are  a technology platform and team of people helping individuals enroll in marketplace coverage. We've enrolled  over 840,000 folks on our platform to date. Apart from product and just leadership things,  I also lead up D&I at HealthSherpa. We're about 20, scaling up to about 40,  50 in the on-season, the open enrollment season.


Makinde Adeagbo: My name is Makinde Adeagbo.

I'm the founder and CEO of /dev/color. We help black  software engineers set and reach ambitious career goals. We are a team of three.


Mitchell Lee: My name is Mitchell Lee.

I'm one of the two co-founders of Penny, which is  a personal finance app that you interact with by way of conversation. We are a  five-person team.


Kat: Awesome. One of the things that was very clear to me as I talked to  a lot of YC alumni is that diversity is defined differently for every company.

I  want to ask a couple of you. Why was D&I important for you and your  company and how did you define it? Let's start with Jen.


Jen: Why was diversity and inclusion important for us? Even though we are an HR tech  startup it really just started as very organically like what do we want to do  as people and as co-workers? How can we build an inclusive place to work? Actually,  once we started telling stories, writing blog posts about it. We realized there's a lot  of resonating with both our applicants and our customers. They wanted to know, what are  you doing differently? What can we learn from? Realizing as leaders in this space, we  had a lot to do to show here's what we're experimenting with and sometimes let's  be real, sometimes make mistakes in. To be honest, what's been really cool is that  it makes a lot of difference and also sales and growth. That we are able  to show this is how we're approaching culture and inclusion with this much intention.

It  allows prospective customers to look at, "Well, if they are building culture, their internal company  culture that way, I want to know what their software looks like.

I want to  know what their product is like." It's been a really huge benefit for us that  it gets to be an ongoing conversation.


Kat: Well, I wanted to … Let's go with Cat.

I really liked hearing about why  you thought it was important and like both for your business case and for culture.


Cat Perez: Yeah. For our team, I mean, I was hire number seven.

I mean, we're a  pretty small team. We scaled up really quickly but by nature who we're serving we  are serving folks of lower-income, folks who would qualify for subsidies on the marketplace. Kaiser  Family Foundation released a report I think for 2015 the majority of the uninsured, under  65 market in the United States are people of color, over half, so 55% to  60%, specifically Latina, Hispanic communities, as well as black and African-American communities. For us it  was, it's a no-brainer.

I mean, our mission is to enroll these people, give them  access to coverage. Let them know what options they have. You can't do that if  you have a team that does not reflect that audience. For us, it was really  simple and straightforward why we needed to do that.


Kat: I'd love to hear a little bit about Stripe. Like why it's important and how  you've defined it? How you interact with the founders as well yeah?
Cristina C.: I would say on our side, we thought about this really early but probably not  in the way that you would think a company would. Both of our founders are  Irish and immigrated to the United States. A lot of our really early employees are  also immigrants everywhere from Honduras to Kenya to Sweden all in our first like 20  or so employees.

I think one of the reasons for that is because of our  core mission, which is really looking at how can we enable economic opportunities and access  to creating an online business no matter where you are in the world. We've launched  products like Atlas which enable entrepreneurs around the world to get set up with like  a US entity and a US bank account, which if you are an entrepreneur in  Cuba or if you are an entrepreneur in Canada, very difficult to do regardless.

I  think for us early on, it was about how can we build this into our  culture because we know that we need to launch a product that works in 20  plus countries now, hopefully, every country eventually. We need to have people onboard who really  understand what are the right products to be building for different entrepreneurs all around the  world, and how can we make it easier for people to become entrepreneurs. The other  piece really early on was in working on diversity and inclusion making sure that we  had a direct line to ultimately people who are making decisions that affect inclusion, diversity  across the company. For us that means me working very, very closely with our CEO  and COO and meeting with them every other week on like how are we doing  on these various different aspects of diversity and inclusion throughout the company, and making sure  that they are aware of what's going on, and that they are approving every single  thing every step of the way. That way I can go about what I need  to do to make things happen within the company.


Kat: Giving you that autonomy and that ability to actually make a change.


Cristina C.: Right.


Kat: Where you see needed. One … The next question I have is like when did  you first start thinking about D&I? A couple of you had some interesting conversations and  I want to talk to Ashu about MakeSchool, and your experience being two guys starting  this company. When did the conversation first come up?
Ashu: Sure. The conversation first came up for us when we started talking to some of  our students. The first time our program we had a particular female student, Sophie, who,  from my co-founders perspective was this confident badass girl who was building this amazing app.  We never really realized that she had a bit of a struggle when she was  actually going through our summer program.

It wasn't until a year later where we started  to talk to some of our students about what their experience with our program was  like, and where we really heard that behind the scenes, there were a lot of  concerns around how she fit into the environment to the summer program.

It's important to  acknowledge that it's not that the environment was explicitly sexist or explicitly discriminatory, but there's  a lot just in terms of the culture and the language that you might not  obviously flag as this is something that might make someone feel uncomfortable or feel not  included.

It was only really hearing her experiences that made us think one level deeper,  not just the, what surface level challenge but one level deep in that. How do  we go above and beyond to try to make the summer environment a lot more  inclusive for people like Sophie? It was really shocking to us to hear about this  experience and because we didn't, we thought that things were actually pretty good. That we  had a pretty good culture in the program but it wasn't until we actually had  these hard conversations and got some very candid feedback to realize that we had a  long way to go to improve that environment.


Kat: Can you give one example of something that she experienced that you didn't realize was  making, was like giving her a hard time or making her like less able to  perform well?
Ashu: Yeah.

I mean, some of the things were a little bit less gendered.

It was  around, she was someone who's very athletic and had a lot of hobbies around, not  just computer science and app development. Most of the students were very focused around app  development and computers and video games, and as a result didn't necessarily feel like she  fit in socially as well with a lot of the other students. A lot of  it is also just feeling whether like she had a place in the environment when  you step into a room where you're one of a few girls or one of  a few people of color.

It becomes a lot tougher to feel like you fit  in. Your doubt, whenever you're having questions or struggle is about, I don't know how  to build this feature, I don't know how to solve this bug. There's two questions  that are being asked one, is it just that I didn't learn this or also  is it because I don't fit here because I'm not a person who should be  a programmer. There's that kind of rhetoric. The society is kind of pushed especially at  the high school level where you tend to have a lot more boys who are  in computer science or math classes. That second line of questioning makes people, or in  her case and other students we've heard makes them less willing to actually go and  approach instructors to ask for help because they feel like I should know this, and  I shouldn't be going to get help for this topic, and so, being more proactive  by offering help definitely.


Kat: One example that you gave that I thought was really like stuck with me was  that when she didn't know something, some of the very young men in the class,  high schoolers would be like, "Oh, you don't know that." I think just like trying  to like I guess like coach people through, like here's an appropriate reaction when someone  asks a question.

I think what, like sharing a really like small personal side note  on that is that like for the first year for example at YC I didn't,  I used to wear dresses all the time.

I didn't, I wore jeans, and like  a graphic tee because I was like, "I just want to fit in." I realized  I was doing, using way more brain cycles and to like really try to like  fit in and like be taken seriously than I like needed to be but I  think if I wish I'd had this conversation because, yes, I think that other people  felt the same thing.

I'd never talked about it until actually right now. There you  go sharing the story first time.

I would love to talk to you Mitch about  Penny because you are one of the, you and I think /dev/color are probably the  most recent companies to go through YC. This is something that you've thought about a  lot. Why are you thinking about it? You’re a team of five?
Mitchell Lee: Five.

I guess I should address the elephant in the room, which is I am  a white male on a D&I panel. We raised a round of funding for Penny  and started to look to expand our team. At the time, we were just two  people and would … A little bit of backstory here. Penny is a conversational app  that helps you with your finances.

It's really intended to help people who struggle with  financial literacy or just find finances intimidating that correlates strongly with people that don't make  a lot of money, lower-income people. We were building this interface which has this personality.  I'm a prolific emoji user, and so Penny ended up using a lot of emojis.  One day my fiancé tapped me on the shoulder, and she says, "I think Penny's  flirting with me." I was like, "Whoa! That … No.

I just use emoji that's,  that's my style," but experiences like that, and I heard from other friends as well.  Really hammered home the point that if we want to build a product that's accessible  to everyone, we need to have a team that looks like the people that were  trying to help, and is representative of the group of people that were trying to  build for. That was one of the turning moments for why we need to focus  on this right now.


Kat: Okay. Makinde, you had mentioned, and I mentioned it briefly, that you think that inclusion  is something that you can tank really early on. Are there any examples you've seen  either on the positive or negative side of companies that you work with that are  doing this really well?
Makinde Adeagbo: Yeah. There's a lot I could say on this one.

I'll start with an example  just from my own organization. Clearly, we're a diverse organization so it matters a lot  to us both for the team that we build but also the membership that we  build. One of my big mistakes early on was taking it for granted.

I'm a  black man.

I was like, "Okay. This should be easy," but I actually very quickly  when starting the organization fell into this trap of, okay, the initial members will be  the people that I know because that's who it's easiest to start with. Turns out  they're not a lot of black women in software engineering in that initial set of  people that I brought together, and right away it became a very clear issue that  the gender balance in our group was off.

It's something that we've worked on since  then.

It's still not where we a lot, and it's something we keep an eye  on, but even just realizing that even I had a blind spot was a big  wake-up call for me.

I'm guessing everyone has a blind spot for different groups.


Kat: Yeah.


Makinde Adeagbo: I think they're small signals. The other thing I'll say is just piggybacking on people  feeling like they belong somewhere. That's another thing that I think it's really easy to  mess up, just realizing that you and your company are constantly sending out signals of  who belongs and who doesn't. For us something as simple as sending out our members  to go on off sites. Right? I was making a list of like, "Here's some  off sites you can consider." I just put a list of things that I enjoy,  which are like zip lining or rock climbing. For some people that was great. For  other people, it sent a subtle signal, again, like, "Hey, is this group for me?  Do I belong here?" I had to actually go back to the drawing board, and  thankfully, we had a lot of different people on our team who could add different  perspectives, and also within the membership who could help fill out that list to be  something that everyone would find something that appealed to them.


Kat: That's really cool. One of the things that I think I heard from all of  you and all the alumni talked about is that one of the major obstacles to  start implementing really impactful D&I programs is getting people to have tough conversations.

It's getting  people, even if they're uncomfortable to have to share and have these conversations. Jen, can  you talk a little bit about you, what's going to come next is inspired by  what Jen told me about a panel she heard about at Pinterest but then also  talk about how you've implemented that at Lever.


Jen: Yeah. The particular problem we were trying to solve for at that time about a  year and a half ago was this question of how do you make inclusion truly  inclusive to make inclusion and culture building a company-wide activity? It's not just, "Oh, that's  like the women's issue or that's like the racial minorities issue." Something we realized was  when we had events and different discussions about inclusion there was a smaller subset of  the company that was very active, very passionate about it. Actually, a larger subset that  consider themselves a little bit on the sidelines. Don’t get me wrong. They thought it  was a good idea. They were very supportive, but for whatever reason, they were a  little bit hesitant to jump really deep in and be visible leaders for it.

It's  wrapping this around my head.

I met a head of inclusion at Pinterest , an  event. She told me about this event that they had called "Sorry.

I Didn't Mean  to Offend." What they did was put members of the majority group.

I think a  lot of engineers, white males. Put them on a panel just like this, and create  a safe space where they were able to talk about mistakes, missteps. Here's something I  just had no idea about, I said something and I offended someone.

I was so  mortified but by having leaders and by having their colleagues speak openly about these events  really set a tone for the culture, right? Saying like, "You are not going to  be vilified by saying the wrong thing. We are going to assume best intentions and  really try to go from there as a team." What we ended up creating inspired  by that idea was a session called "D&I for Our Supporters." It was an internal  seminar led by, actually, somebody on our team who's also from a majority group, a  straight, white male engineer. The fact that maybe it was led by him, I had  like two different factors. One, maybe because when the person leading it is someone from  the majority group people are like, "Oh, I'm like way more curious about it. Like  maybe I should go even though previous events that they didn't really seem like they  were for me." Then, second, again, really designing it for with that audience in mind.  The subtitle to that seminar was "D&I for Dummies." It's like, "If you are ever  confused or uncertain and you just didn't want to say the wrong thing so you've  been holding yourself back. This is a space to come for you." It ended up  being really successful and a lot of people who previously weren't actively involved, came and  shared really personal stories and opened up. Just to wrap this up, I think something  one of my co-workers have said, this is a black male co-worker of mine who  said, "You know, when the cause isn't your own, it can feel really uncomfortable to  speak out on behalf even if you really, really want to because again that fear  of saying the wrong thing, being misinterpreted, being attacked even, so really is a deliberate  effort you have to make for, you know, your future employees, your culture to say  that this is okay. We're going to navigate through these things just like you would  with any business problem for a growing company."
Kat: In the spirit of getting people to talk about hard things and having hard conversations,  I would like everyone on this panel to share a story about a mistake they  made or a misstep, and something that they wish they could have a do-over on  when they started thinking about D&I at their workplace. Let's talk about our mistakes. Do  you want to start? … I need a volunteer.


Male: Yeah.

I messed up on gender balance for the organization at the at the start.  I'm still developing more strategies to sustainably fix that issue.

I've made a lot of  mistakes.

I will say that we're pretty early on, and so, for us, I don't  view it so much as mistakes.

It's just learning opportunities. There was a lot of  learning opportunities as we started this process. How do you approach the subject with people  that you're interested in recruiting? How do you position it within your own company and  have an open dialogue there? There were also just small missteps like we had one  woman that actually ended up joining our team. We had a dinner with the team,  and the way that we were like positioned at the dinner was just very aggressive.  It was like a noisy environment. She was surrounded by men. We were peppering her  with questions and like that's just not a way to make somebody feel comfortable and  open up with you on a personal level. There are a lot of but I  do think that we're learning, and we're getting better at this, and step one is  just talk about it openly.


Kat: Yeah.


Cat Perez: We had a few missteps I'd like to call them and early on when we  started our D&I initiatives. We started about two years ago, and at the time, I  had come on as hire number seven. We were still pretty small, made a really  big mistake of assuming everyone had the same perception of what diversity and inclusion meant  to each and every one of us, and our lived experiences. That means everyone including  white males on the team. All right, so Jenny talked about this but one of  our biggest missteps was just not necessarily even practicing this concept of inclusion with our  white male team members, right? Their thoughts matter. They need to be involved in the  conversation as well.

I think that was our biggest mistake, is just assuming, "Oh, team  of seven, everyone conceptually agrees we should do this," but not really having that tough  uncomfortable conversation about it. Then the second thing I'll just add there is we approach  it as a to-do list which is a terrible thing to do. We were overly  ambitious. We had like seven initiatives we wanted to roll out at the same time.  Definitely, don't do that. One is enough. We learn to approach MVP style. Start small  because this stuff is really emotionally taxing and intense and triggering for people. Yeah, just  starting small would have been something we would have changed from the start. …
Cristina C.: I would say for us at Stripe, that probably one of the biggest mistakes we  made fairly early on was we need to hire a pretty significant number of engineers  in a very fast period of time in our early growth. We hadn't necessarily hired  the number of engineers that we were looking to hire in that period of time,  which was about three months, at that rate, ever, in our history. We set a  really audacious goal in terms of the percentage of women and percentage of underrepresented minorities  that would make up this batch of engineers that we wanted to bring on in  that short period of time. We set this lofty goal. We had all these aspirations,  but we actually had no plan for how to meet that goal. Of course, we  completely failed.

It was a very hard time I think in the company because we,  effectively, we hired all the engineers that we wanted to hire but not many of  them were people of color or women, and as a result, we had to sit  down as a company and say like, "Yeah. We screwed up." We had to admit  that like all hands in front of our entire company and start thinking about, "Okay,  well, what are we going to do to fix this?" Because we are going to  continue to hire engineers, and we need to set up a plan so that we  can do that in a more effective way. What we did from that point on  was say that I think at Stripe at the time we had this disconnect between  recruiting and hiring managers.

I think in a lot of ways hiring managers, people who  need to add engineers onto their team think about in the context of like, "Well,  recruiting is bringing me these candidates, and so I'm going to, you know, find the  best ones and bring them through my hiring pipeline." The reality is that as a  hiring manager it's your responsibility for what your team looks like at the end of  the day. You need to take an active role in that hiring process. We actually  implemented two quarters ago a goal effectively saying that every engineering manager is required to  bring an underrepresented candidate. A person of color or a woman for engineering. All the  way through to the on-site stage of our hiring pipeline at Stripe. This really put  the onus on the end managers to do this because we, one, created a public,  internally public spreadsheet in the company of all the end managers and which one of  them had met the goal. They could see this, their team members could see this.  If they weren't dedicating the time necessary to meet this goal everyone would know about  it. That really put the power in the hands of the hiring managers to say,  "Well, okay, like how can I go out there and meet people who are not  in my direct network and how can I ensure that we are bringing more people  from different backgrounds into the funnel of our hiring pipeline? We've 3x the number of  women in engineering that we would normally hire during that period of time through that  effort.


Jen: Cool.

I have a story about how we made a mistake and a really valuable  lesson was how we were going to treat and deal with other future problems like  that. We have a employee resource group called Leverets. That's what we call female employees  of Lever.

It's a Slack channel and a dinner, I think two or three times  a year to talk about issues, resources, mentorship.

I had found out that about a  year and a half ago somebody had created a private Slack channel called Lever Dudes.  This is a little bit of gray area.

I think you'll find the pattern in  that the gray areas and they're the awkward, uncomfortable, ambiguous problems are some of the  hardest because if you looked at the channel, there was nothing like super wrong with  it but there was this tone that could be interpreted as a little bit of  mocking.

It was said something like, "Well, they have a Leverets channel so it's only  fair." There's some jokes that again nothing super crazy but it didn't make people who  were in it actually, other men didn't feel good about it. When it was brought  up to me, we talked about how one of our standards and principles for D&I  is this phrase, "The standard that you …" Sorry. "If you see something say something.  The standard that you walk past is a standard you accept." Even though it's comfortable  it was our job as startup employees as leaders to do something about it. We  reached reach out to one of our founders, Randal, who was incredibly empathetic, listened to  the situation, took it really seriously. The problem here was that, again, I was like  undermining the other Leverets channel in the group, and also, if left alone it could  potentially lead to a little bit of like us-versus-them mentality if it were to grow,  right? He ended up addressing the employee in question, super professionally like not trying to  call him out just saying that like, "Hey, this is not okay so I'd like  to talk about what happened." Again, really trying to understand and listen, but then also  draw the lines. Then this is I think the next part what he did was  really stepping up as a leader, and again, like Stripe, we decided to address it  at our next All Hands.

I think that's one of our key learnings. You have  to address things.

It's not fun, nobody goes up to All Hands in front of  your entire company saying like this happened and it was super uncomfortable and awkward, but  you have to do it otherwise it becomes an elephant in the room. Randall addressed  the entire company. What's really interesting was that he started the story saying by being  very honest about a mistake that he had made in the past. When the Leverets  group was first formed, and it was just the four of us women just going  out to dinner. He made a joke about like, "Well, maybe I'll grab some of  the engineers and go and get pizza or something," like the same night.

It wasn't  until later he realized that wasn't actually a very, that wasn't what he meant to  say because, again, if you think about why that group exists in the first place  because women may not be minorities but they are minorities in tech. Therefore, they have  experiences, burdens, hardships that you might not even know about. The reason the group exists  is not to have fun and go out and go to drinks and talk about,  I don't know, nail polish.

It really is about the work and what can we  do to support ourselves, each other, and just for future employees, and future inclusion, and  just being really honest and authentic as a leader I think made a huge difference.  Later that day in Slack, multiple employees both, and also in person, went up to  Randal to thank him, to say things like, "My previous startup founders would never do  anything like that.

I feel really grateful and lucky to work for a place where  the leaders really care about the people, and it's very human and authentic." I think  that was a lesson that we learned.

It's not just to address it one on  one, you want to prevent it from happening in the future, very easily a new  hire could have been joining six months later, and the same thing happens over again.  How do you address it head on? Really step up as a leader.

It's not  going to be fun sometimes.

It's not going to be comfortable, but that is your  responsibility. The thing is, people will remember the tone you set, what you say. Your  employees remember, and it gets embedded into the culture as you grow.


Male: Yes. Cat touched on earlier which is this concept of surprise.

In the first summer,  we had asked certain students to, "Hey, can you zip up your folder and email  it to us?" Students would say, "Hey, I don't know how to zip up a  folder." We'd say, "Wait, you don't know how to zip up a folder. That's like  such a basic thing," but it operates on the assumption that this person has gone  through the same education and upbringing that you have, such that they'll actually know this  thing that you're asking them do. That was a big one, and especially from a  standpoint of a teacher, not a really great thing for a student to hear. The  second one was starting from very early in the company we had a very like  strong voice culture in meetings that we had. Anytime there's some discussion about different topics,  it get pretty heated, voices would raise, not in a, I guess, argumentative or in  a healthy debate way, but it also means the people who are more introverted or  more soft-spoken suddenly don't have as much voice.

It's really a big problem when you're  including those folks in meetings, and they're not only getting a chance to speak. Those  are I think two big mistakes that we made. The main thing that we've done  from a cultural standpoint to make it, help people work on these mistakes is really  assuming negligence and not malice in this kind of situations, and really focusing on where  people are going as opposed to necessarily where they are. Both my co-founder and I  were quite young when we were starting the company.

I had lots of mistakes in  terms of leadership and management.

It's only because we have a culture where other folks  on the team are willing to understand that we're constantly trying to improve. Similarly, if  you notice some behavior and nuance, say something about it.

It's important not to make  the person feel that they are a bad person for having said this, but really  just help coach them so that a year from now they'll be a lot better  in this kind of situations.


Kat: Cool. Now, and you've all sort of talked a little bit about some things you're  doing that are going well, but like shifting a little bit from the mistakes that  you've made in the past or that your organizations have made in the past. Let's  start talking about things that you're trying, that you're excited about that are paying off,  that are, that you think are going well in terms of building this great culture  from scratch.


Female: Is it going well for anyone?
Kat: Yeah.

I think it's like the thing is like, we know there's no easy button  but if there are any like lights that we can follow.


Cat Perez: Yeah.

I can only share what's worked for us. What's worked for us may not  work for everyone. There is no playbook the one size or blueprint that, one size  fits all. For us, at HealthSherpa, what we did when we were hiring is we  leveraged POT tools, not to be mistaken with the other pot. People Ops Tools, that's  what it stands for. One specifically that we use it was called Unitive.

It's a  Capital, a portfolio company. They're called now. We used it to run our job descriptions  through it. The job description check would score the job description.

It would call out  words that were heavily biased. The reason we did that was to obviously cast a  wider net. Super easy tool to use. They had other features like the blind resume  review, as well as scoring questions and making sure that each person who was interviewing  a candidate was asking every single person the same question, and those questions map back  to competencies and skills that you need.

It's not this, when you're startup you're going  to do things in a scrappy way, but we finally built some structure around our  interview process. What we ended up finding after rolling out that one initiative is we  ended up hitting our diversity goals. We 2x are Hispanic, Latina hires and team members  as well as our black team members as well.

It totally worked. Another thing I  like to throw in there as we had that new team using leveraging that initiative,  is we had a plus 85% revenue growth as well.

I would like to attribute  that to the team that we had in place.

It's just a testament to the  fact that hiring diverse team members, especially when you're serving diverse communities really does impact  your bottom line.


Male: Yeah.

I actually get this question a lot because of what our organization is. A  lot of founders of small companies will come up and ask, "Hey, how do I  hire more Latin X or black or female engineers?" What I usually actually tell them  is, "Look, if your company is 4, 5, 10 people what you should really think  about is what are the attributes and skills that you need on the team and  be really honest about those things." For example, if you're building an Ag tech company,  right? All of your employees are from cities. That may not be the most effective  thing when you're trying to sell and no one has ever been on a farm.  I think it's like step one for me is really taking a really honest look  at what you need your employees to be able to do, and what specific things  matter to you at the stage that you're at. Then hiring against those things, as  opposed to just trying to like check the boxes or make your numbers look a  certain way because you know when you're larger, the press will be looking at your  stats. Figure out what's important to you at your stage. Then hire against that.  I think the thing that we probably have done best is start early. We started  thinking about this when we were two and three people. That's important both because the  people that you hire early on are eventually going to go on to be the  leaders at your company and hire their own teams. You want to make sure that  you're building the team now that you eventually want to have.

It's also important because  if you end up as a team of 15 white and Asian dudes sitting in  a room and start trying to incorporate diversity into your team at that point, good  luck, because, I mean, people don't want to be a token diversity candidate or feel  alienated by a culture that's already in place. That's a big one. We've also been  pretty proactive. You mentioned blinding the resume or putting together good job descriptions. That at  a very early stage is not quite enough because you're working with a much smaller  funnel. We've been very proactive about saying, "No. We're actually seeking out people of different  backgrounds and different cultures to try to incorporate them into the team early on." Partnering  with like different organizations that can help broaden your recruiting funnel there was something that  we, I think, did well early on.  For us talking about these issues and whether it's community, culture, diversity and talking about  them at effectively reset points. For our education programs when the programs actually start is  a really good time, but with the company if you can't always go back and  reset to the very beginning so at a company off-site let's say in January right  after everyone's come back from winter break, usually is a good time to address these  topics because whatever impression you set and whatever culture you start building in the first  few weeks of the new year will typically last throughout the year. The second piece  is providing mentorship, especially for our students, providing mentorship of people who look like them  and feel like them. We have one of our alums, Leslie, who actually works at  Lever. She's been amazing in terms of creating a support group for our current female  students in our college program. That's gone a really long way to helping that. Then,  finally, just talking about the numbers.

It's not … You shouldn't be ashamed if your  numbers are not very diverse. Last year, the first year of our college program we  had one girl out of about 22 students which was not great, but we still  talked about that and we thought about how can we actively improve that and because  it was open, an open dialogue, we could think about how to make plans to  address that. Now, we have about 7 girls out of 40 or 36 students and  100% retention throughout the year, which is a big improvement for last year. For both  programs as well as for the staff we've started talking about the numbers when they  weren't great, and then, continue to increase and improve them year over year.


Female: How are we doing on time?
Kat: If you could each one minute, and then, I think I'll … Yeah. Sorry.


Jen: Yeah.

I'll keep it short then. You're hearing a lot of answers both on the  diversity side and inclusion side, and I can talk a lot about there, but one  thing that I think adding on to those two at the end said, really figure  out what works for your company that might not be for every other company. For  us, we are a SaaS organization.

In that, we have a quite a large sales  part of the company. Another very common association with like what makes a really good  sales person is that like, "Oh, we should get some athletes in here, right? Like  athletes are the best salespeople." I have no doubt that some of the best salespeople  are in fact previous athletes, but that doesn't mean that if you weren't an athlete  you're going to be not good enough.

It really took to examining some of these  biases and beliefs that we have in the valley and workplaces in general and really  looking at, is that actually true and is that going to work for us at  Lever? We've been able to have … Yeah. Just make the previous athletic, previous college  athletic experience required like taking that out of job descriptions, and making sure people are  not being punished or feeling like they're being left out because they didn't have this  certain background.


Cristina C.: Last thing I'll say is we did probably 20 things to improve our intern diversity  for this past year.

In 2016, we had 11% women and underrepresented minorities in our  intern class, which was failure, mistake. This year we had over 41% women and underrepresented  minorities in our intern class. We over double the intern program.

I would say one  of the things that we did in particular that had that effect was we created  multiple ways to actually get into our intern pipeline. Your traditional way of showing up  at a career fair, for example, or applying to our website were still ways that  we looked at candidates, but we found that all the other technology companies were looking  at those exact same candidates. You are looking at the same candidates that had two  other great internships at Google and Facebook et cetera. You were all fighting over those  particular candidates. When the reality is you're looking for capabilities at the internship stage. You're  not necessarily looking for people who have tons of experience because the likelihood is, if  you're in college you probably don't have very much experience at all. How can we  hunt for people who are like have those fantastic capabilities that we need that we  think are going to do really well at Stripe? One of the things that we  did was create two additional application paths. One was a coding challenge that you could  do in your own free time. Then submit that challenge to us, and you'd actually  go straight to a phone interview. You didn't even have to talk to a recruiter.  The other path was a show us your code option. We went to a bunch  of events like Black Society of Engineers at certain different colleges, the Grace Hopper et  cetera. We said, "If you just take out your computer and show us a project  of something that you've built.

If we think the code is good like you automatically  get to next stage." How can we think about candidates as more than just their  resume especially when in reality at a college stage the resume probably doesn't really matter  that much.


Kat: Yeah. All right. We are time. Thank you all for sharing all your stories.

I  realize a lot of you are pre-hiring. You aren't thinking about some of these issues  but I'm going to, I created a resource list.

It's a living document.

I will  list everything that you guys mentioned. All the resources and tools that you've used and  where Steven is going to be sharing that with the class and with everyone online.  Jen, I'd wanted you to talk a little bit about the framework for creating like  ongoing D&I programs, but I'm just going to have you since we don't have time,  I will hopefully work with you on a blog that you can blog post and  Lever also has an incredible series.

It's a 10-part series that walks through D&I for  companies that I also added on the resources list of great places to start if  you're looking to read up more on this. We will be sharing that list with  you and also putting together all your notes, and then, anything else that we missed.  This is such a meaty topic, and there's a lot here, but thank you also  for listening. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions that you have  either for the speakers or for me.

I'm Kat. K-A-T@ .com and I can connect  you to any of these ladies and gentlemen if that's desired. Thank you again. Thank  you. A round of applause.
