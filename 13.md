# Diversity & Inclusion at Early Stage Startups

#早期初创企业的多样性和包容性

Kat: I started at YC in 2013, as YCs first director of outreach. That meant outreach  to potential applicants. People who were starting companies so basically people like you. When I  started at YC we had grown totally organically up until that point. That meant that  most of the people applying to YC had heard about YC through Paul Graham's essays,  through reading Jessica Livingston's book, or because they were Hacker News readers. Hacker News started  out as a reddit for tech and startup news, but if you've ever read the  comments it might not shock you to realize that most of the Hacker News community  is male, and if I had to guess even though we don't have those specific  demographics I would guess white male. Basically, I was tasked, I realized and I think  Paul and Jessica realized also that there are smart hard-working people all over the world  who should be starting startups who weren't users of Hacker News.

凯特：我于2013年开始在YC工作，担任YC的第一任外联主任。这意味着与潜在申请者接触。那些创办公司的人基本上都是像你这样的人。当我开始在YC，我们已经完全有机地成长，直到那时。这意味着大多数申请YC的人都是通过保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)的文章、阅读杰西卡·利文斯顿(Jessica Livingston)的书，或者因为他们是黑客新闻(Hacker News)的读者黑客新闻最初是科技和创业新闻的编辑，但如果你看过这些评论，你可能不会感到震惊，因为你意识到大多数黑客新闻社区都是男性，如果我不得不猜测，即使我们没有这些特定的人口统计数据，我也会猜测白人男性。基本上，我被赋予了任务，我意识到保罗和杰西卡也意识到，世界各地都有一些聪明、努力工作的人，他们应该开始创业，而不是黑客新闻的用户。

I was tasked with  figuring out where are these smart and hardworking people and how do we get them  to consider applying to YC. How do we get them to consider starting a company  if they hadn't started already? One of the things I end up working a lot  on at YC is finding ways to recruit founders and from what is typically underrepresented  communities in tech. Then I also think a lot about what do we do to  support those communities once they're here, once they're starting companies, once they're in Silicon Valley.  To be honest, I was not super aware of the particular challenges that a lot  of women and people of color face in tech when I started in 2013.

我的任务是找出这些聪明而勤劳的人在哪里，以及如何让他们考虑申请YC。如果他们还没有开始创业，我们该如何让他们考虑创办一家公司呢？最后，我在YC做了很多工作，其中一件事就是找到招聘创始人的方法，以及从科技界代表性不足的社区招聘创始人。然后我也想了很多，我们应该做些什么来支持这些社区一旦他们在这里，一旦他们开始公司，一旦他们在硅谷。老实说，当我在2013年开始工作的时候，我还没有完全意识到很多女性和有色人种在科技界所面临的特殊挑战。

In  2012, I know the big mantra, the big thing everyone said is tech is a  meritocracy.

在2012年，我知道这句大话，大家说的最重要的是科技是精英统治。

I wanted to believe that.

我想要相信。

I wanted to believe.

我想相信。

In my, and I have  been personally very, very lucky I'm to work in an environment that is very supportive  of me. Working at YC for example with Paul and just get first then with  Sam. The other partners I was really lucky that they took a chance on me.  That they give me a lot of autonomy and a lot of opportunity to do  great work, but even in a place where I think I have had like a  pretty great experience, I've had moments and I've had experiences that make me wonder whether  my life, whether my job would have been easier if I were a man.

在我的，我个人来说，我非常幸运，我能够在一个非常支持我的环境中工作。例如，在YC和Paul一起工作，然后再和Sam一起工作。其他合伙人-我很幸运-他们抓住了我的机会。他们给了我很大的自主权，也给了我很多机会去做伟大的工作，但是即使在我认为我有一个非常好的经历的地方，我也有过一些时刻，我的经历让我怀疑我的生活，如果我是一个男人，我的工作会不会变得更容易。

I've  struggled with a lot of anxiety about am I meant to be here? Am I  qualified for this job? There are certain experiences for example not so long ago, there  was a founder for example who had a meltdown. He had a meltdown about something  that frankly, I or none of the partners had any control over, and frankly, he  didn't have any control over it either. What does he do? He calls me and  he yells. He starts yelling, uncontrollably, and as I'm on the phone with this founder  I'm thinking, "Why am I the target for this? I don't see him yelling at  other partners.

我很担心我会在这里吗？我胜任这份工作吗？有一定的经验-例如不久前，有一位创始人-例如，他经历了一场灾难。坦率地说，他对一些事情感到崩溃，我或任何合伙人都没有控制权，坦白说，他对此也没有任何控制权。他是做什么的他打电话给我然后大叫。他开始大喊大叫，无法控制，当我和这位创始人打电话的时候，我在想，“为什么我是这个的目标？我没看到他对其他合伙人大喊大叫。”

I don't see him yelling at other male partners." It just really bothered  me.

我没看到他对其他男拍档大喊大叫。“这真的让我很困扰。

It really set me back for a little while. Frankly, in the work that  I do with the founders that is what really makes me realize that we have  such a long way to go. For example, just in the last batch, I had  founders tell me stories about being asked out on dates by customers or by investors.  We had one woman who was told by an investor that she needed to find  a white male co-founder to pitch for her. We had one woman at demo day,  she was a non-profit founder who an investor came up, and said, "Hey, I'll give  you $2000 if you babysit my kids." I'm like, "What the fuck?" I think what  strikes me is that we are living in 2017. We are living in one of  the most liberal places, most progressive places in the United States if not the world.  What I believe is that we have an opportunity here to do better.

这真的让我倒退了一段时间。坦率地说，在我和创始人一起做的工作中，这让我真正意识到我们还有很长的路要走。例如，就在最后一批，我的创始人给我讲述了客户或投资者在约会时邀请我的故事。我们有一位女性，一位投资者告诉她，她需要找一位白人男性联合创始人为她卖命。我们在演示日有一位女士，她是一位非营利性的创始人，一位投资者来了，她说：“嘿，如果你照看我的孩子，我会给你2000美元。”我说，“搞什么鬼？”我认为让我印象深刻的是，我们生活在2017年。我们生活在美国最自由的地方之一，如果不是世界上最进步的地方的话。我相信我们在这里有机会做得更好。

I'm excited  for you because I think that one of the things that's most exciting is that  you have this opportunity to build a culture from scratch. Companies are basically like their  own countries. You have the opportunity to build the world that you want to live  in. Some of the best founders I've worked with are ambitious. They're idealistic. They sign  up to solve these big problems because they see that they're unsatisfied with something they  see in the world. They think like, "Hey, I can, I have the opportunity here  to make real change." You end up creating an ecosystem with its own rules, its  own structure, and its own culture. That will be modeled based on your personality and  your beliefs as founders. When Sam asked me to host this workshop I realized that  YC doesn't have a playbook. We don't have a playbook that we just go to  that walks early-stage companies through how to think about D&I issues, but if you paid  any attention to the tech news in the past few years you've realized that there's  a momentum building up around the conversations around D&I, and basically, I think you all  realize at this point as I have that most companies really feel and wish that  they had thought about this stuff earlier on in the life cycles of their company.  What I decided to do was I decided to talk to as many YC companies  as possible.

我为你们感到兴奋，因为我认为最令人兴奋的事情之一是你们有机会从头开始建立一种文化。公司基本上就像他们自己的国家。你有机会建立你想要生活的世界。与我共事过的一些最优秀的创始人都是雄心勃勃的。他们是理想主义者。他们注册来解决这些大问题，是因为他们对他们在世界上看到的东西感到不满意。他们想，“嘿，我可以，我有机会在这里做真正的改变。”你最终创造了一个生态系统，它有它自己的规则，它自己的结构，它自己的文化。这将建立在你作为创始人的个性和信念的基础上。当山姆邀请我主持这个研讨会时，我意识到YC没有剧本。我们没有一本能让早期公司了解如何思考D&I问题的剧本，但如果你在过去几年里关注科技新闻，你就会意识到，围绕着D&I的对话形成了一股势头，基本上，我认为你们都意识到，就像我所说的，大多数公司都是真的。感觉并希望他们在公司生命周期的早期就已经考虑过这件事了。我决定和尽可能多的YC公司交谈。

I wanted to find out how they thought about D&I at their companies?  Why it was important to them? I want to figure out what was working? What  was exciting them about the space? I think most importantly perhaps what is not working?  I brought six of the people here today that I thought I had the most  interesting and thoughtful conversations with. They're going to share their stories and observations with you.  The folks up here I believe will have basically enough knowledge in this space to  fill a book, but for today we have pretty simple goals. First, we want to  better define what diversity and inclusion are.

我想知道他们如何看待D&I在他们的公司？为什么对他们很重要？我想弄清楚什么起作用了？是什么让他们对太空感到兴奋？我认为最重要的也许是什么不起作用？我今天带了六个人来这里，我认为我和他们进行了最有趣和最周到的交谈。他们会和你分享他们的故事和观察。我相信这里的人在这个空间里会有足够的知识来填充一本书，但是今天我们有相当简单的目标。首先，我们希望更好地界定什么是多样性和包容性。

I think the words are so overused these  days especially in the media that they become a little empty. We’ll talk briefly about  how we define each of these terms in this context. Next, we'll talk about why  D&I was important for these companies to think about, and when they started thinking about  it. A little bit about why you should think about it right now even at  the very earliest stages. Then, finally, we want to talk about how to build a  culture that embraces hard conversations. Diversity and inclusion even for me as a woman and  as a person of color can feel like really scary and awkward topics.

我认为这些词现在被过度使用了，特别是在媒体中，它们变得有些空洞。我们将简要讨论如何在这种背景下定义这些术语。接下来，我们将讨论为什么D&I对这些公司来说很重要，以及他们什么时候开始考虑这个问题。关于为什么你现在应该考虑它，即使是在非常早期的阶段。最后，我们想谈一谈如何建立一种包容艰难对话的文化。多样性和包容性，即使对我来说，作为一个女人和一个有色人种，也会让我感到非常可怕和尴尬的话题。

I have  a lot of anxiety about offending or angering other people. That's what scares and stresses  me out the most, but I also realize that having these hard conversations with your  co-founders and with the folks at work with you. These are some of the most  important conversations to have. Many of you today and many of you watching are pre-hiring.  We're not going to get into the nitty-gritty of things like writing job descriptions or  how to conduct interviews because I will, but I will share a page of resources  for you that you can reference when you're ready for that stage. Today I think  we'll talk about things that you can bake into your culture from day one that  will help you lay the foundation of building a company where everyone is set up  to do their best work. Hopefully, you'll leave here today with at least one thing  that you feel excited and like prepared to try to implement or try out. Really  quickly, diversity and inclusion. These are broad concepts. They're going to mean different things to  different companies, different companies into different people. One of my favorite definitions that I've heard  is by , who is a lawyer who does a lot of D&I consulting for  the legal world. She describes diversity as being invited to the party whereas inclusion is  being asked to dance. Diversity in this context I think will relate to finding and  hiring people from a range of backgrounds. What diversity is not is a code word  for gender or race. Diversity I think can mean a lot of things.

我很担心冒犯或激怒别人。这就是最让我恐惧和压力最大的地方，但我也意识到，和你的联合创始人以及和你一起工作的人进行这些艰难的交谈。这是一些最重要的谈话。今天你们中的许多人和你们中的许多人都是在招聘前。我们不会进入细节的事情，如写工作说明或如何进行面试，因为我会，但我会分享一页的资源，你可以参考，当你准备好那个阶段。今天，我想我们将讨论从第一天开始，你就可以把这些东西融入到你的文化中，这将帮助你为建立一个每个人都能尽力而为的公司奠定基础。希望你今天离开这里，至少有一件事让你感到兴奋，并且准备好尝试实现或尝试。非常迅速，多样性和包容性。这些都是宽泛的概念。对于不同的公司，不同的人，它们意味着不同的东西。我最喜欢的定义之一是，他是一名律师，为法律界提供大量的D&I咨询服务。她把多样性描述为被邀请参加聚会，而包容则被邀请跳舞。我认为，在这方面的多样性将与寻找和雇用来自不同背景的人有关。多样性不是性别或种族的代名词。我认为多样性可能意味着很多事情。

It can  mean different academic backgrounds.

这可能意味着不同的学术背景。

It can mean different ages, national origins, religions, work experiences, perspectives.  It's going to be up to you to decide what diversity means for your company  and what you'd like to focus on first, and what you decide to focus on  first is going to change.

它可能意味着不同的年龄，民族起源，宗教，工作经历，观点。这将取决于你决定多样性对你的公司意味着什么，你想首先关注什么，你决定首先关注什么是改变。

It's going to change depending on certain factors.

这将取决于某些因素的变化。

It might  depend on where your company is based and what the demographics are like in that  region.

这可能取决于你的公司在哪里，以及该地区的人口统计情况。

It might depend on your product. What is going to be important? If you  want to build a diverse team you have to think about it deliberately because one  trap that happens is that people focus on hiring individuals. What happens is you come  up with a template in your mind for what an ideal employee would look like.  Then suddenly, you have a homogenous team. Many of the alumni I've talked to who  are doing this really well have said they've had to stretch themselves, they've had to  think about hiring a team. Basically, like every … A great team won't all have  the same strengths and weaknesses. The individuals won't have the same strengths and weaknesses. They  will have skills that complement each other, and if you think about it in your,  some of your context, if you're trying to choose a co-founder, for example, you wouldn't  want to work with a clone of yourself. You would ideally want to work with  someone who had complementary skills. Let's see. Moving on to inclusion. Let's see. Sorry. Most  founders I talked to say that after a fundraising the ongoing hardest part of their  job is hiring.

这可能取决于你的产品。什么是重要的？如果你想建立一个多元化的团队，你必须慎重考虑，因为其中一个陷阱是人们专注于雇佣个人。所发生的是，你想出了一个模板，一个理想的员工会是什么样的。然后突然间，你有了一个同质的团队。与我交谈过的很多校友都说，他们不得不做好自己的工作，他们不得不考虑雇佣一个团队。基本上，就像每个…一个伟大的团队不会都有相同的优势和弱点。这些人不会有同样的长处和弱点。他们将拥有互补的技能，如果你在你的，你的环境中去思考，如果你试图选择一个共同的创始人，例如，你不想和你自己的克隆人一起工作。理想情况下，你会希望与有互补技能的人一起工作。让我们看看。进入包容。让我们看看。抱歉的我采访过的大多数创始人都说，筹资之后，他们工作中最艰难的部分就是招聘。

It's hiring great talent, but one thing that a people related challenge  that is less talked about is retaining. How do you get great talent to stay  at your company? You can do the work to recruit talent but if your culture  is garbage they're probably not going to stay for very long. The Center just released  a tech Lever survey which talks about why people voluntarily leave their jobs in tech.  I recommend you read the whole thing.

这是招聘优秀人才，但一个人相关的挑战，较少谈论是保留。你如何才能留在你的公司？你可以做招聘人才的工作，但如果你的文化是垃圾，他们可能不会呆很久。该中心刚刚发布了一项科技杠杆调查，其中谈到了为什么人们自愿离开他们的工作在科技业。我建议你把整件事看一遍。

It's really interesting.

真的很有趣。

It's not incredibly long. These  are just four main takeaways. As the Center has laid out in their study this  is a huge problem.

不算太长。这是四个主要的外卖。正如该中心在他们的研究中所指出的那样，这是一个巨大的问题。

It's a very expensive problem for tech. They've seen that D&I  initiatives if done right can improve culture and really reduce turnover. Jen from lab review  you'll meet soon was talking about like what does the flip side look like? There's  a lot of these like terrible cases of what happens when you don't think about  culture early, but if you do build a culture that is great. What do you  get? You get a place where people have strong personal bonds. They are loyal to  your mission. They stay a long time. Lever, I've been specifically really impressed with. They  are at about a 100 employees. They have a 50/50 percent gender split.

这对科技界来说是个非常昂贵的问题。他们已经看到，如果做得好，D&I倡议可以改善文化，并真正减少营业额。你很快会遇到的实验室评审的Jen在谈论相反的一面是什么样子的？有很多这样的例子，比如当你没有提前思考文化时会发生什么，但是如果你确实建立了一种很棒的文化。你得到了什么？你得到了一个人们有很强的人际关系的地方。他们忠于你的使命。他们呆了很长时间。杠杆，我被特别打动了。他们大约有100名雇员。她们的性别比例为50%。

I hope  when Jen gets up here today she talks a little bit more about the positive  benefits that she's seen at Lever as a result of them having thought about culture  and inclusion from a very, very early stage.

我希望当珍今天来到这里的时候，她会更多地谈论她在Lever所看到的积极的好处，因为他们从一个非常早期的阶段就开始思考文化和包容问题。

In all my conversations with YC alumni,  the thing I heard repeated over and over again is that inclusion is just one  aspect of building a great culture from scratch.

在我与YC校友的所有谈话中，我一遍又一遍地听到，包容只是从零开始建立一种伟大文化的一个方面。

Inclusion is really about building a culture  where everyone can feel safe and where people don't have to shy away from having  these like really tough and awkward sometimes conversations. We'll talk about some of those ways  that companies are tackling that challenge on the panel, but first, let's talk really briefly  about why you might even want to start thinking about this right now. There's a  great McKinsey study that came out in 2015 that I included in the resources doc.  That I suggest you read, but here are some thoughts from YC alumni. Porter Braswell  is the founder of a company called Jopwell. They connect black and Latin, and Native  American people with jobs. He described why it's important in this way. How can you  build world-changing products or services if you don't have a complete understanding of the different  perspectives that exist in the world? The founders of ExVivo, another company, YC company learned  this the hard way. They said, "We figured out early that if we hired people  who came from the same academic background they approach problems in the same way." ExVivo  brought up a really great example to illustrate that point.

包容实际上是建立一种文化，让每个人都能感到安全，而且人们不必回避这些事情，有时甚至是非常艰难和尴尬的谈话。我们将讨论公司在小组中应对这一挑战的一些方法，但首先，让我们简单地谈谈为什么你现在可能会开始考虑这个问题。麦肯锡在2015年发表了一项伟大的研究，我在“资源博士”中加入了这一研究。我建议你读，但这是YC校友的一些想法。PorterBraswell是一家名为Jopwell的公司的创始人。他们把黑人、拉丁人和美洲土著人与工作联系起来。他用这种方式描述了为什么这件事很重要。如果你不完全理解世界上存在的不同观点，你怎么能建立改变世界的产品或服务呢？另一家公司，YC公司，ExVivo的创始人们也很难学到这一点。他们说：“我们很早就意识到，如果我们雇用来自同一学术背景的人，他们就会以同样的方式处理问题。”Exvivo提出了一个非常好的例子来说明这一点。

I want to like do  a quick experiment here. How many of you keep your ketchup in the fridge, in  the refrigerator? How many of you keep your ketchup in the cupboard? Whoa! There's a  great episode of the podcast reply-all where they interview Scott Paige, who's a professor at  the University of Michigan who studies teens. Scot says that language, age, geography, personal hardship  that is all going to influence how we solve problems. He gave this example of  where you keep your ketchup.

我想在这里做个简单的实验。你们中有多少人把番茄酱放在冰箱里？你们中有多少人把番茄酱放在柜子里？哇哦！播客的回复中有一个很棒的插曲-他们都采访了研究青少年的密歇根大学教授斯科特·佩吉(ScottPaige)。苏格兰人说，语言、年龄、地理、个人困难都会影响我们解决问题的方式。他举了个例子说明你把番茄酱放在哪里。

It turns out after he did the study if you  are British or African-American from the south there's a strong probability that you will keep  your ketchup in the cupboard.

结果发现，在他做了这项研究之后，如果你是英国人还是来自南方的非裔美国人，很有可能你会把番茄酱放在橱柜里。

If you are not either of those things there's a  strong probability that you will keep your ketchup in the fridge. You might think like,  "Why does this matter? Like this seems like a really trivial point." What happens if  you run out of ketchup? If you are a ketchup in the fridge person you  open the fridge, and you might replace it with the things that are next to  the ketchup in the fridge, which are usually mustard or mayo, but if you are  a ketchup in the cupboard person you might open the cupboard and realize, "I'm out  of ketchup." You might put malt vinegar on your fries.

如果你没有这两样东西，很有可能你会把番茄酱放在冰箱里。你可能会想，“这有什么关系？就像这似乎是一个微不足道的问题。”如果番茄酱用完了怎么办？如果你是冰箱里的番茄酱，你可以打开冰箱，用冰箱里番茄酱旁边的东西代替，通常是芥末或蛋黄酱，但如果你是橱柜里的番茄酱，你可能会打开橱柜，意识到“我没有番茄酱了。”你可以在薯条上放麦芽醋。

I love that example because  basically, it showcases that like the more diverse backgrounds you have represented, the more associations  you get, the more ways that you can, you have more pathways to solving problems.  Honestly, before hearing the study I had no idea that humans even put their ketchup  in the cupboard.

我喜欢这个例子，因为基本上，它表明，你所代表的背景越多样化，你得到的联系越多，你可以用更多的方法解决问题。老实说，在听到这项研究之前，我不知道人类甚至把番茄酱放在柜子里。

I didn't know people like that existed.

我不知道有这样的人。

I was like, "Wow! This  is blowing my mind." Anyway recruiting might not be something that you're thinking about right  now, but inclusion is in the words of Makinde, who you'll meet very brief in  a couple minutes.

我说：“哇！这简直让我心神不宁。”无论如何，招聘可能不是你现在正在考虑的事情，但是用Makinde的话来说，包括在内，几分钟后你就会见到他。

Inclusion is something you can tank early on. There are really well-known  stories about what happens when you don't start thinking about this at an early stage.  There is issues with the ride-sharing company, who will not be named, but let's also  talk about Airbnb. Last year at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech Conference, the founder of Airbnb  Brian Chesky was talking about how they were struggling with claims that Airbnb enabled discrimination,  especially against the African-American community. He admitted he was like, "I think we were late  to this issue." He said, "You know, we realized that when we were building a  platform we were three white guys, Joe, Nate, Brian." He said, "That there were a  lot of things we didn't think about." There were a lot of steps that they're  having to reevaluate now, and so, now that we've talked briefly about D&I, how to  define it? Why you might want to think about it? I would love to invite  the panel up to share their stories and observations and have them introduce themselves as  well. Let's bring you, guys, up. Thank you, Steven.

包容是你可以尽早接受的东西。当你在早期没有开始思考这件事的时候，会发生什么，这确实是众所周知的故事。有问题的乘坐共享公司，谁将不愿透露姓名，但让我们也谈谈Airbnb。去年，在“财富”头脑风暴技术会议上，Airbnb创始人布赖恩·切斯基(BrianChesky)谈到，他们是如何努力应对有关Airbnb导致歧视的说法，尤其是针对非裔美国人的歧视。他承认说，“我想我们在这件事上迟到了。”他说，“你知道，我们意识到，当我们建造一个平台时，我们是三个白人，乔，内特，布莱恩。”他说，“有很多事情我们都没有想过。”他们现在需要重新评估很多步骤，所以，既然我们已经简要地讨论了D&I，如何定义它？你为什么要考虑这件事？我想邀请小组成员分享他们的故事和观察，并让他们自我介绍。伙计们，带你们上来。谢谢你，史蒂文。


Speaker 2: Oh, no, I'm not … some will be sharing the mic because …
Kat: Yeah. You can just pass them and … Is this awkward if I'm standing? Is  it okay? Okay.

哦，不，我不是…有些人将共享麦克风，因为…凯特：是的。你可以通过他们和…如果我站着这很尴尬吗？可以吗？好的。

I would love you to go down the line and introduce your  name, your company, your role, and how big your company is today.

我是Penny的两位联合创始人之一，这是一款个人理财应用，你可以通过交谈的方式与其互动。我们是一个五人小组。


Kat: Awesome. One of the things that was very clear to me as I talked to  a lot of YC alumni is that diversity is defined differently for every company.

太棒了。在我和很多YC校友交谈时，我非常清楚的一点是，对每一家公司来说，多样性的定义都是不同的。

I  want to ask a couple of you. Why was D&I important for you and your  company and how did you define it? Let's start with Jen.

我想问你们几个。为什么D&I对你和你的公司很重要，你是如何定义它的？我们从珍开始吧。


Jen: Why was diversity and inclusion important for us? Even though we are an HR tech  startup it really just started as very organically like what do we want to do  as people and as co-workers? How can we build an inclusive place to work? Actually,  once we started telling stories, writing blog posts about it. We realized there's a lot  of resonating with both our applicants and our customers. They wanted to know, what are  you doing differently? What can we learn from? Realizing as leaders in this space, we  had a lot to do to show here's what we're experimenting with and sometimes let's  be real, sometimes make mistakes in. To be honest, what's been really cool is that  it makes a lot of difference and also sales and growth. That we are able  to show this is how we're approaching culture and inclusion with this much intention.

珍：为什么多样性和包容性对我们来说很重要？尽管我们是一家人力资源科技初创公司，但它实际上只是刚刚起步，就像我们作为人和同事想要做的事情一样。我们怎样才能建立一个包容的工作场所？事实上，一旦我们开始讲故事，就会写博客文章。我们意识到我们的申请人和我们的客户之间都有很大的共鸣。他们想知道，你在做什么？我们能从中学到什么？意识到作为这个领域的领导者，我们有很多事情要做，这就是我们正在做的实验，有时让我们真实，有时会犯错误。老实说，真正酷的是它带来了很大的不同，同时也带来了销售和增长。我们能够展示这一点，这就是我们是如何以如此多的意图来对待文化和包容的。

It  allows prospective customers to look at, "Well, if they are building culture, their internal company  culture that way, I want to know what their software looks like.

它让潜在的客户看到，“好吧，如果他们在构建文化，他们的内部企业文化是这样的话，我想知道他们的软件是什么样子的。

I want to  know what their product is like." It's been a really huge benefit for us that  it gets to be an ongoing conversation.

我想知道他们的产品是什么样子的。


Kat: Well, I wanted to … Let's go with Cat.

凯特：嗯，我想要…我们和猫一起去吧。

I really liked hearing about why  you thought it was important and like both for your business case and for culture.

我真的很喜欢听你说为什么你认为它很重要，对你的商业案例和文化来说都是如此。


Cat Perez: Yeah. For our team, I mean, I was hire number seven.

是的。我是说，我是第七名。

I mean, we're a  pretty small team. We scaled up really quickly but by nature who we're serving we  are serving folks of lower-income, folks who would qualify for subsidies on the marketplace. Kaiser  Family Foundation released a report I think for 2015 the majority of the uninsured, under  65 market in the United States are people of color, over half, so 55% to  60%, specifically Latina, Hispanic communities, as well as black and African-American communities. For us it  was, it's a no-brainer.

我是说，我们是个很小的团队。我们增长很快，但从本质上说，我们所服务的是低收入人群，也就是那些有资格在市场上获得补贴的人。凯撒家庭基金会发布了一份报告，我认为2015年美国65岁以下未投保人群中的大部分是有色人种，超过一半，所以55%到60%，特别是拉丁裔、西班牙裔以及黑人和非裔美国人。对我们来说，这是不需要思考的。

I mean, our mission is to enroll these people, give them  access to coverage. Let them know what options they have. You can't do that if  you have a team that does not reflect that audience. For us, it was really  simple and straightforward why we needed to do that.

我是说，我们的任务是让这些人入伍，让他们有机会获得保险。让他们知道他们有什么选择。如果你有一个不反映观众的团队，你就不可能做到这一点。对我们来说，我们需要这样做是非常简单和直接的。


Kat: I'd love to hear a little bit about Stripe. Like why it's important and how  you've defined it? How you interact with the founders as well yeah?
Cristina C.: I would say on our side, we thought about this really early but probably not  in the way that you would think a company would. Both of our founders are  Irish and immigrated to the United States. A lot of our really early employees are  also immigrants everywhere from Honduras to Kenya to Sweden all in our first like 20  or so employees.

凯特：我想听听斯特里普的一些情况。比如为什么它很重要，你是如何定义它的？你和创始人的互动方式是吗？克里斯蒂娜·C：我想说的是，在我们这一边，我们考虑得很早，但可能不是你认为公司会想到的那样。我们的创始人都是爱尔兰人，都移民到了美国。我们的很多早期雇员也是移民，从洪都拉斯到肯尼亚，再到瑞典，都是在我们的第一批员工中，大约有20人左右。

I think one of the reasons for that is because of our  core mission, which is really looking at how can we enable economic opportunities and access  to creating an online business no matter where you are in the world. We've launched  products like Atlas which enable entrepreneurs around the world to get set up with like  a US entity and a US bank account, which if you are an entrepreneur in  Cuba or if you are an entrepreneur in Canada, very difficult to do regardless.

我认为其中一个原因是因为我们的核心使命，那就是我们如何才能让经济机会和机会去创造一个在线商业，不管你在世界的哪里。我们推出了类似Atlas这样的产品，让世界各地的企业家能够像美国实体和美国银行账户一样建立自己的账户，如果你是古巴的企业家，或者你是加拿大的企业家，那么不管你做什么，都很难做到。

I  think for us early on, it was about how can we build this into our  culture because we know that we need to launch a product that works in 20  plus countries now, hopefully, every country eventually. We need to have people onboard who really  understand what are the right products to be building for different entrepreneurs all around the  world, and how can we make it easier for people to become entrepreneurs. The other  piece really early on was in working on diversity and inclusion making sure that we  had a direct line to ultimately people who are making decisions that affect inclusion, diversity  across the company. For us that means me working very, very closely with our CEO  and COO and meeting with them every other week on like how are we doing  on these various different aspects of diversity and inclusion throughout the company, and making sure  that they are aware of what's going on, and that they are approving every single  thing every step of the way. That way I can go about what I need  to do to make things happen within the company.

我想对我们来说，这是关于我们如何把它融入我们的文化，因为我们知道我们需要在20多个国家推出一种产品，希望最终每个国家都能成功。我们需要有真正了解什么是适合世界各地不同企业家的产品的人，以及怎样才能让人们更容易成为企业家。另一件非常早期的工作是致力于多样性和包容性，以确保我们有一个直接的路线，最终作出决定的人，影响包容性，多样性在整个公司。对我们来说，这意味着我与我们的首席执行官和首席运营官非常、非常密切地合作，每隔一周与他们会面，就像我们在整个公司的多样性和包容性的这些不同方面做得如何，并确保他们意识到正在发生的事情，并确保他们每一步都认可每一件事情。这样，我就可以做我需要做的事情，使事情在公司内发生。


Kat: Giving you that autonomy and that ability to actually make a change.

凯特：让你有自主权，有能力做出改变。


Cristina C.: Right.

克里斯蒂娜C.：对。


Kat: Where you see needed. One … The next question I have is like when did  you first start thinking about D&I? A couple of you had some interesting conversations and  I want to talk to Ashu about MakeSchool, and your experience being two guys starting  this company. When did the conversation first come up?
Ashu: Sure. The conversation first came up for us when we started talking to some of  our students. The first time our program we had a particular female student, Sophie, who,  from my co-founders perspective was this confident badass girl who was building this amazing app.  We never really realized that she had a bit of a struggle when she was  actually going through our summer program.

凯特：在你认为需要的地方。一个…我的下一个问题是，你是什么时候开始考虑D&I的？你们中的一些人进行了一些有趣的谈话，我想和阿苏谈谈MakeSchool的事情，以及你们两个人创办这家公司的经历。谈话是什么时候开始的？阿苏：当然。当我们开始和我们的一些学生交谈时，我们第一次想到了这个话题。我们的节目第一次有一个特别的女学生，苏菲，从我的共同创始人的角度来看，她是一个自信的坏女孩，她正在开发这个令人惊叹的应用程序。我们从来没有真正意识到，当她真的在参加我们的暑期课程的时候，她遇到了一点困难。

It wasn't until a year later where we started  to talk to some of our students about what their experience with our program was  like, and where we really heard that behind the scenes, there were a lot of  concerns around how she fit into the environment to the summer program.

直到一年后，我们才开始和我们的一些学生谈论他们对我们项目的体验，我们在那里真正听到的是，在幕后，人们对她如何适应暑期项目的环境有很多担忧。

It's important to  acknowledge that it's not that the environment was explicitly sexist or explicitly discriminatory, but there's  a lot just in terms of the culture and the language that you might not  obviously flag as this is something that might make someone feel uncomfortable or feel not  included.

重要的是要认识到，环境并不是明显的性别歧视或明显的歧视，但在文化和语言方面，你可能不太清楚，因为这可能会让人感到不舒服或不被包括在内。

It was only really hearing her experiences that made us think one level deeper,  not just the, what surface level challenge but one level deep in that. How do  we go above and beyond to try to make the summer environment a lot more  inclusive for people like Sophie? It was really shocking to us to hear about this  experience and because we didn't, we thought that things were actually pretty good. That we  had a pretty good culture in the program but it wasn't until we actually had  these hard conversations and got some very candid feedback to realize that we had a  long way to go to improve that environment.

只有真正听到她的经历，我们才能更深入地思考，不仅仅是表面层面的挑战，而是其中的一个层面。我们如何超越和超越，试图使夏天的环境更包容像苏菲这样的人？听到这样的经历我们真的很震惊，因为我们没有，所以我们认为事情真的很好。我们在节目中有一个相当好的文化，但直到我们真正地进行了这些艰难的对话，得到了一些非常坦率的反馈，我们才意识到我们要改善这个环境还有很长的路要走。


Kat: Can you give one example of something that she experienced that you didn't realize was  making, was like giving her a hard time or making her like less able to  perform well?
Ashu: Yeah.

凯特：你能举个例子，她没有意识到你在做什么，比如给她一段艰难的时光，或者让她表现得不太好？阿苏：是啊。

I mean, some of the things were a little bit less gendered.

我是说，有些东西不那么有性别色彩。

It was  around, she was someone who's very athletic and had a lot of hobbies around, not  just computer science and app development. Most of the students were very focused around app  development and computers and video games, and as a result didn't necessarily feel like she  fit in socially as well with a lot of the other students. A lot of  it is also just feeling whether like she had a place in the environment when  you step into a room where you're one of a few girls or one of  a few people of color.

它就在周围，她是一个非常健美的人，有很多爱好，不仅仅是计算机科学和应用程序开发。大多数学生都非常专注于应用程序开发、电脑和电子游戏，因此不一定觉得她和其他许多学生都很合群。当你走进一个你是少数女孩之一或少数有色人种之一的房间时，很多事情也只是感觉到她是否在环境中占有一席之地。

It becomes a lot tougher to feel like you fit  in. Your doubt, whenever you're having questions or struggle is about, I don't know how  to build this feature, I don't know how to solve this bug. There's two questions  that are being asked one, is it just that I didn't learn this or also  is it because I don't fit here because I'm not a person who should be  a programmer. There's that kind of rhetoric. The society is kind of pushed especially at  the high school level where you tend to have a lot more boys who are  in computer science or math classes. That second line of questioning makes people, or in  her case and other students we've heard makes them less willing to actually go and  approach instructors to ask for help because they feel like I should know this, and  I shouldn't be going to get help for this topic, and so, being more proactive  by offering help definitely.

感觉自己适应起来就难多了。你的怀疑，每当你有问题或挣扎是关于，我不知道如何构建这个特性，我不知道如何解决这个错误。有两个问题正在被问到，一个是因为我没有学到这个，还是因为我不适合这里，因为我不是一个应该成为程序员的人。有那种花言巧语。这个社会在某种程度上受到了推动，特别是在高中阶段，在计算机科学或数学课上，你往往会有更多的男孩。第二道问话会让人们，或者是我们听说过的其他学生，更不愿意去找老师寻求帮助，因为他们觉得我应该知道这一点，我不应该在这个话题上得到帮助，所以，要更积极主动，明确地提供帮助。


Kat: One example that you gave that I thought was really like stuck with me was  that when she didn't know something, some of the very young men in the class,  high schoolers would be like, "Oh, you don't know that." I think just like trying  to like I guess like coach people through, like here's an appropriate reaction when someone  asks a question.

凯特：你给我的一个例子是，当她不知道的时候，班上的一些非常年轻的男人，高中生会说，“哦，你不知道。”我想，就像我想要像教练一样，当有人问一个问题的时候，这里有一个恰当的反应。

I think what, like sharing a really like small personal side note  on that is that like for the first year for example at YC I didn't,  I used to wear dresses all the time.

我想，就像分享一个非常类似于个人的小纸条一样，比如在YC的第一年，我从来不穿连衣裙。

I didn't, I wore jeans, and like  a graphic tee because I was like, "I just want to fit in." I realized  I was doing, using way more brain cycles and to like really try to like  fit in and like be taken seriously than I like needed to be but I  think if I wish I'd had this conversation because, yes, I think that other people  felt the same thing.

我没有，我穿着牛仔裤，就像一个平面T恤，因为我想，“我只是想融入其中。”我意识到我在做什么，用更多的大脑周期，喜欢真正喜欢融入，喜欢被认真对待，但我想如果我希望我能有这样的对话，因为，是的，我认为其他人也有同样的感受。

I'd never talked about it until actually right now. There you  go sharing the story first time.

直到现在我才谈过这件事。你第一次分享这个故事。

I would love to talk to you Mitch about  Penny because you are one of the, you and I think /dev/color are probably the  most recent companies to go through YC. This is something that you've thought about a  lot. Why are you thinking about it? You’re a team of five?
Mitchell Lee: Five.

我很想和你谈谈Penny的事，因为你是其中之一，我认为/dev/color可能是最近通过YC的公司之一。这是你想了很多的事情。你为什么要想这件事？你们是一队五人？米切尔·李：五。

I guess I should address the elephant in the room, which is I am  a white male on a D&I panel. We raised a round of funding for Penny  and started to look to expand our team. At the time, we were just two  people and would … A little bit of backstory here. Penny is a conversational app  that helps you with your finances.

https://tmt.ap-beijing.tencentcloudapi.com/?Action=TextTranslate&Nonce=1234&ProjectId=1257710951&Region=ap-beijing&SecretId=AKIDPqCXo8hXckompwwu7EB4sWzTvJXboBh2&Source=en&SourceText=I+guess+I+should+address+the+elephant+in+the+room%2C+which+is+I+am++a+white+male+on+a+D%26I+panel.+We+raised+a+round+of+funding+for+Penny++and+started+to+look+to+expand+our+team.+At+the+time%2C+we+were+just+two++people+and+would+%E2%80%A6+A+little+bit+of+backstory+here.+Penny+is+a+conversational+app++that+helps+you+with+your+finances.&Target=zh&Timestamp=1538785183&Version=2018-03-21&Signature=Yeha/LSUqe9tiBKmWn61h4Qxgto=

It's really intended to help people who struggle with  financial literacy or just find finances intimidating that correlates strongly with people that don't make  a lot of money, lower-income people. We were building this interface which has this personality.  I'm a prolific emoji user, and so Penny ended up using a lot of emojis.  One day my fiancé tapped me on the shoulder, and she says, "I think Penny's  flirting with me." I was like, "Whoa! That … No.

它真正的目的是帮助那些与金融知识相关的人，或者只是发现财务上的威胁与那些没有赚到很多钱的人，低收入的人有着密切的联系。我们建立了一个具有这种个性的界面。我是一个多产的表情用户，所以Penny最终使用了大量的表情符号。有一天，我的未婚妻拍了拍我的肩膀，她说：“我觉得佩妮在和我调情。”我说，“哇！那个…不。

I just use emoji that's,  that's my style," but experiences like that, and I heard from other friends as well.  Really hammered home the point that if we want to build a product that's accessible  to everyone, we need to have a team that looks like the people that were  trying to help, and is representative of the group of people that were trying to  build for. That was one of the turning moments for why we need to focus  on this right now.

我只是用表情符号，这是我的风格，“但这样的经历，我也从其他朋友那里听到。我们真正强调的一点是，如果我们想要建立一个人人都能获得的产品，我们就需要一个团队，这个团队看起来就像那些试图帮助我们的人，并且代表着一群试图为之而建的人。这是我们现在需要关注这个问题的转折点之一。


Kat: Okay. Makinde, you had mentioned, and I mentioned it briefly, that you think that inclusion  is something that you can tank really early on. Are there any examples you've seen  either on the positive or negative side of companies that you work with that are  doing this really well?
Makinde Adeagbo: Yeah. There's a lot I could say on this one.

凯特：好的。Makinde，你已经提到过，我也简要地提到过，你认为包含的东西是你可以很早就能接受的。你有没有见过在你与之合作的公司的积极或消极的方面，这些公司都做得很好？马金德·阿迪亚博：是的。在这件事上我可以说很多。

I'll start with an example  just from my own organization. Clearly, we're a diverse organization so it matters a lot  to us both for the team that we build but also the membership that we  build. One of my big mistakes early on was taking it for granted.

我将从我自己的组织开始一个例子。很明显，我们是一个多元化的组织，所以对于我们所建立的团队和我们所建立的成员来说，这对我们都很重要。我早年犯的一个大错误是认为这是理所当然的。

I'm a  black man.

我是个黑人。

I was like, "Okay. This should be easy," but I actually very quickly  when starting the organization fell into this trap of, okay, the initial members will be  the people that I know because that's who it's easiest to start with. Turns out  they're not a lot of black women in software engineering in that initial set of  people that I brought together, and right away it became a very clear issue that  the gender balance in our group was off.

我说，“好吧，这应该很容易，”但是当组织开始的时候，我很快就陷入了这个陷阱，好吧，最初的成员将是我认识的人，因为这是最容易开始的人。结果发现他们并不是软件工程领域的很多黑人女性，他们是我聚集在一起的第一批人，我们这个群体中的性别平衡已经成为一个非常明显的问题。

It's something that we've worked on since  then.

从那以后我们就一直在研究这个问题。

It's still not where we a lot, and it's something we keep an eye  on, but even just realizing that even I had a blind spot was a big  wake-up call for me.

这仍然不是我们经常关注的地方，也是我们一直在关注的事情，但即使我意识到，即使是我有一个盲点，对我来说也是一个很大的警钟。

I'm guessing everyone has a blind spot for different groups.

我猜每个人对不同的群体都有盲点。


Kat: Yeah.

凯特：是的。


Makinde Adeagbo: I think they're small signals. The other thing I'll say is just piggybacking on people  feeling like they belong somewhere. That's another thing that I think it's really easy to  mess up, just realizing that you and your company are constantly sending out signals of  who belongs and who doesn't. For us something as simple as sending out our members  to go on off sites. Right? I was making a list of like, "Here's some  off sites you can consider." I just put a list of things that I enjoy,  which are like zip lining or rock climbing. For some people that was great. For  other people, it sent a subtle signal, again, like, "Hey, is this group for me?  Do I belong here?" I had to actually go back to the drawing board, and  thankfully, we had a lot of different people on our team who could add different  perspectives, and also within the membership who could help fill out that list to be  something that everyone would find something that appealed to them.

马金德·阿迪亚博：我认为它们是小信号。我要说的另一件事就是依靠那些觉得自己属于某个地方的人。这是我认为很容易搞砸的另一件事，我只是意识到你和你的公司一直在发出信号，说明谁属于谁不属于谁。对于我们来说，一些简单的事情，就像把我们的成员派到场外去。对吗？我在列一个类似的列表，“这是一些你可以考虑的网站。”我只是列出了我喜欢的东西，比如拉链或攀岩。对某些人来说真是太棒了。对其他人来说，它又发出了一个微妙的信号：“嘿，这群人是我的吗？我属于这里吗？”我不得不回到画板上，谢天谢地，我们团队中有很多不同的人，他们可以添加不同的观点，也可以在成员中帮助填写这份名单，这样每个人都会找到对他们有吸引力的东西。


Kat: That's really cool. One of the things that I think I heard from all of  you and all the alumni talked about is that one of the major obstacles to  start implementing really impactful D&I programs is getting people to have tough conversations.

凯特：那真的很酷。我想我从你们所有人和所有校友那里听到的一件事是，开始实施真正有影响的D&I项目的主要障碍之一是让人们进行艰难的对话。

It's getting  people, even if they're uncomfortable to have to share and have these conversations. Jen, can  you talk a little bit about you, what's going to come next is inspired by  what Jen told me about a panel she heard about at Pinterest but then also  talk about how you've implemented that at Lever.

这是让人们，即使他们不舒服，必须分享和进行这些谈话。珍，你能谈谈你吗，接下来要做的是Jen告诉我她在Pinterest上听说过的一个小组，但也谈到了你是如何在Lever实现这一点的。


Jen: Yeah. The particular problem we were trying to solve for at that time about a  year and a half ago was this question of how do you make inclusion truly  inclusive to make inclusion and culture building a company-wide activity? It's not just, "Oh, that's  like the women's issue or that's like the racial minorities issue." Something we realized was  when we had events and different discussions about inclusion there was a smaller subset of  the company that was very active, very passionate about it. Actually, a larger subset that  consider themselves a little bit on the sidelines. Don’t get me wrong. They thought it  was a good idea. They were very supportive, but for whatever reason, they were a  little bit hesitant to jump really deep in and be visible leaders for it.

珍：是的。大约一年半前，我们试图解决的具体问题是，如何使包容性成为真正的包容性，从而使包容性和文化建设成为全公司的活动？这不仅仅是“哦，这就像女人的问题或者种族少数的问题。”我们意识到，当我们举办各种活动和不同的讨论时，公司中有一小部分人非常活跃，对此非常热情。实际上，是一个更大的子集，它认为自己有一点站在一边。别误会我的意思。他们认为这是个好主意。他们非常支持，但无论出于什么原因，他们都有点犹豫，不愿跳入其中，成为这方面的显要领袖。

It's  wrapping this around my head.

它把这个包裹在我的头上。

I met a head of inclusion at Pinterest , an  event. She told me about this event that they had called "Sorry.

我在Pinterest遇到了一位参与的负责人，这是一次活动。她告诉我这件事他们称之为“对不起”。

I Didn't Mean  to Offend." What they did was put members of the majority group.

我不是有意冒犯的。“他们所做的是把大多数人都放进去。

I think a  lot of engineers, white males. Put them on a panel just like this, and create  a safe space where they were able to talk about mistakes, missteps. Here's something I  just had no idea about, I said something and I offended someone.

我想很多工程师，白人男性。把他们放在一个像这样的面板上，创造一个安全的空间，让他们能够谈论错误和错误。有件事我不知道，我说了一些话，我冒犯了某人。

I was so  mortified but by having leaders and by having their colleagues speak openly about these events  really set a tone for the culture, right? Saying like, "You are not going to  be vilified by saying the wrong thing. We are going to assume best intentions and  really try to go from there as a team." What we ended up creating inspired  by that idea was a session called "D&I for Our Supporters." It was an internal  seminar led by, actually, somebody on our team who's also from a majority group, a  straight, white male engineer. The fact that maybe it was led by him, I had  like two different factors. One, maybe because when the person leading it is someone from  the majority group people are like, "Oh, I'm like way more curious about it. Like  maybe I should go even though previous events that they didn't really seem like they  were for me." Then, second, again, really designing it for with that audience in mind.  The subtitle to that seminar was "D&I for Dummies." It's like, "If you are ever  confused or uncertain and you just didn't want to say the wrong thing so you've  been holding yourself back. This is a space to come for you." It ended up  being really successful and a lot of people who previously weren't actively involved, came and  shared really personal stories and opened up. Just to wrap this up, I think something  one of my co-workers have said, this is a black male co-worker of mine who  said, "You know, when the cause isn't your own, it can feel really uncomfortable to  speak out on behalf even if you really, really want to because again that fear  of saying the wrong thing, being misinterpreted, being attacked even, so really is a deliberate  effort you have to make for, you know, your future employees, your culture to say  that this is okay. We're going to navigate through these things just like you would  with any business problem for a growing company."
Kat: In the spirit of getting people to talk about hard things and having hard conversations,  I would like everyone on this panel to share a story about a mistake they  made or a misstep, and something that they wish they could have a do-over on  when they started thinking about D&I at their workplace. Let's talk about our mistakes. Do  you want to start? … I need a volunteer.

我感到很羞愧，但是有了领导和他们的同事公开谈论这些事件，真的为文化定下了基调，对吗？他说：“你不会因为说错了话而被诋毁，我们会假设最好的意图，并真正尝试作为一个团队从那里走下去。”最后，我们在这个想法的启发下创造了一个叫做“为我们的支持者提供的D&I”的会议。这是一个内部研讨会，实际上是由我们团队中的一个人领导的，他也来自一个多数群体，一个白人男性工程师。事实上，也许是由他领导的，我有两个不同的因素。第一，也许是因为当领导的人是来自大多数群体的人时，人们会说：“哦，我对这件事更感兴趣，就像我应该去，即使以前发生的事情，他们看起来并不是真的适合我。”然后，第二，再次，真正为那些观众设计它。那次研讨会的副标题是“Dummies的D&I”。就像，“如果你曾经困惑或不确定，你只是不想说错误的事情，所以你一直在克制自己，这是一个空间，为你自己。”它最终非常成功，许多以前没有积极参与的人来了，分享了真正的个人故事，并打开了大门。最后，我想我的一个同事说过，这是我的一个黑人男同事，他说：“你知道，当事业不是你自己的时候，即使你真的很想说出来，你也会感到很不舒服，因为害怕说错的话，被误解，甚至被攻击，真的很不舒服。”你必须为你未来的员工、你的文化做出深思熟虑的努力，说这没什么大不了的。我们将像对待成长中的公司的任何业务问题一样，在这些问题上做好准备。“凯特：本着让人们谈论艰难的事情和进行艰难的谈话的精神，我希望这个小组中的每一个人都能分享一个故事，讲述他们犯了一个错误或一个错误，以及当他们在工作场所开始思考D&I的时候，他们希望能重温一遍的事情。让我们谈谈我们的错误。你想开始吗？…我需要一个志愿者。


Male: Yeah.

男：是啊。

I messed up on gender balance for the organization at the at the start.  I'm still developing more strategies to sustainably fix that issue.

一开始我就搞砸了这个组织的性别平衡。我仍在制定更多的策略，以可持续的方式解决这个问题。

I've made a lot of  mistakes.

我犯了很多错误。

I will say that we're pretty early on, and so, for us, I don't  view it so much as mistakes.

我会说我们很早就开始了，所以，对我们来说，我不认为这是错误。

It's just learning opportunities. There was a lot of  learning opportunities as we started this process. How do you approach the subject with people  that you're interested in recruiting? How do you position it within your own company and  have an open dialogue there? There were also just small missteps like we had one  woman that actually ended up joining our team. We had a dinner with the team,  and the way that we were like positioned at the dinner was just very aggressive.  It was like a noisy environment. She was surrounded by men. We were peppering her  with questions and like that's just not a way to make somebody feel comfortable and  open up with you on a personal level. There are a lot of but I  do think that we're learning, and we're getting better at this, and step one is  just talk about it openly.

只是学习机会而已。当我们开始这个过程的时候，有很多学习的机会。你如何与你感兴趣的人讨论这个问题？你如何在你自己的公司内定位，并在那里进行公开的对话？还有一些小失误，比如我们有一位女士最终加入了我们的团队。我们和球队共进晚餐，我们在晚宴上的定位方式非常有侵略性。就像一个嘈杂的环境。她被男人包围着。我们不停地问她问题，好像这不是一个让人感到舒服的方式，而是在个人层面上对你敞开心扉。有很多，但我确实认为我们正在学习，我们正在变得更好，第一步就是公开地谈论它。


Kat: Yeah.

凯特：是的。


Cat Perez: We had a few missteps I'd like to call them and early on when we  started our D&I initiatives. We started about two years ago, and at the time, I  had come on as hire number seven. We were still pretty small, made a really  big mistake of assuming everyone had the same perception of what diversity and inclusion meant  to each and every one of us, and our lived experiences. That means everyone including  white males on the team. All right, so Jenny talked about this but one of  our biggest missteps was just not necessarily even practicing this concept of inclusion with our  white male team members, right? Their thoughts matter. They need to be involved in the  conversation as well.

猫佩雷斯：我们有一些失误，我想打电话给他们，并在早期，当我们开始我们的D&I倡议。我们大约两年前就开始了，那时，我已经成为第七名了。我们仍然很小，犯了一个很大的错误，以为每个人对多样性和包容对我们每个人以及我们的生活经历都有相同的看法。这意味着队里每个人都包括白人男性。好吧，詹妮谈到了这个，但是我们最大的错误之一就是不一定要和我们的白人男性团队成员一起练习这个包容的概念，对吗？他们的想法很重要。他们也需要参与谈话。

I think that was our biggest mistake, is just assuming, "Oh, team  of seven, everyone conceptually agrees we should do this," but not really having that tough  uncomfortable conversation about it. Then the second thing I'll just add there is we approach  it as a to-do list which is a terrible thing to do. We were overly  ambitious. We had like seven initiatives we wanted to roll out at the same time.  Definitely, don't do that. One is enough. We learn to approach MVP style. Start small  because this stuff is really emotionally taxing and intense and triggering for people. Yeah, just  starting small would have been something we would have changed from the start. …
Cristina C.: I would say for us at Stripe, that probably one of the biggest mistakes we  made fairly early on was we need to hire a pretty significant number of engineers  in a very fast period of time in our early growth. We hadn't necessarily hired  the number of engineers that we were looking to hire in that period of time,  which was about three months, at that rate, ever, in our history. We set a  really audacious goal in terms of the percentage of women and percentage of underrepresented minorities  that would make up this batch of engineers that we wanted to bring on in  that short period of time. We set this lofty goal. We had all these aspirations,  but we actually had no plan for how to meet that goal. Of course, we  completely failed.

我认为这是我们最大的错误，只是假设，“哦，七人小组，每个人在概念上都同意我们应该这么做”，但并不是真的对此进行了艰难而不舒服的讨论。然后我要补充的第二件事是，我们把它作为一个待办事项清单来处理，这是一件很糟糕的事情。我们太野心勃勃了。我们有大约七项计划，我们想同时推出。当然，别那么做。一个就够了。我们学会接近MVP风格。从小事开始，因为这些东西对人来说是非常令人激动的、紧张的和触发的。是的，从小事开始我们就会从一开始就改变了。…克里斯蒂娜·C：我想对我们说，在斯特里普，我们早期犯的最大错误之一可能是我们需要在我们成长初期的一段非常快的时期内雇佣相当多的工程师。在这段时间里，我们不一定雇佣了我们想要聘用的工程师的数量，这是我们历史上大约三个月的时间。我们设定了一个非常大胆的目标，那就是妇女的比例和任职人数不足的少数群体的比例，这将构成我们希望在短时间内培养出来的一批工程师。我们设定了这个崇高的目标。我们有所有这些愿望，但实际上我们没有计划如何实现这一目标。当然，我们完全失败了。

It was a very hard time I think in the company because we,  effectively, we hired all the engineers that we wanted to hire but not many of  them were people of color or women, and as a result, we had to sit  down as a company and say like, "Yeah. We screwed up." We had to admit  that like all hands in front of our entire company and start thinking about, "Okay,  well, what are we going to do to fix this?" Because we are going to  continue to hire engineers, and we need to set up a plan so that we  can do that in a more effective way. What we did from that point on  was say that I think at Stripe at the time we had this disconnect between  recruiting and hiring managers.

我认为这是一个非常艰难的时期，因为我们，实际上，我们雇用了所有我们想聘用的工程师，但他们中没有多少人是有色人种或女性，结果，我们不得不作为一个公司坐下来，说：“是的，我们搞砸了。”我们不得不承认，就像所有的人一样，在我们整个公司面前，我们开始思考，“好吧，我们该怎么做才能解决这个问题呢？”因为我们将继续雇用工程师，我们需要制定一个计划，这样我们才能以更有效的方式做到这一点。从那时起，我们所做的就是说，我认为当时在Stripe，我们在招聘经理和招聘经理之间存在着这种脱节现象。

I think in a lot of ways hiring managers, people who  need to add engineers onto their team think about in the context of like, "Well,  recruiting is bringing me these candidates, and so I'm going to, you know, find the  best ones and bring them through my hiring pipeline." The reality is that as a  hiring manager it's your responsibility for what your team looks like at the end of  the day. You need to take an active role in that hiring process. We actually  implemented two quarters ago a goal effectively saying that every engineering manager is required to  bring an underrepresented candidate. A person of color or a woman for engineering. All the  way through to the on-site stage of our hiring pipeline at Stripe. This really put  the onus on the end managers to do this because we, one, created a public,  internally public spreadsheet in the company of all the end managers and which one of  them had met the goal. They could see this, their team members could see this.  If they weren't dedicating the time necessary to meet this goal everyone would know about  it. That really put the power in the hands of the hiring managers to say,  "Well, okay, like how can I go out there and meet people who are not  in my direct network and how can I ensure that we are bringing more people  from different backgrounds into the funnel of our hiring pipeline? We've 3x the number of  women in engineering that we would normally hire during that period of time through that  effort.

我认为，在很多方面，招聘经理，那些需要在团队中增加工程师的人会在这样的背景下思考，“好吧，招聘给我带来了这些候选人，所以我会，你知道，找到最好的人选，让他们通过我的招聘渠道。”事实是，作为一名招聘经理，这是你对你的团队在一天结束时的样子的责任。你需要在招聘过程中发挥积极作用。实际上，我们在两个季度前实现了一个目标，有效地说，每个工程经理都必须带上一个代表人数不足的候选人。有肤色的人或从事工程学的女人。一直到我们在Stripe的招聘管道的现场阶段。这就让最终管理者有责任去做这件事，因为我们，一个，在公司里创建了一个公开的，内部公开的电子表格，由所有的最终管理者组成，他们中的一个已经达到了目标。他们可以看到这个，他们的团队成员可以看到这个。如果他们没有投入必要的时间来达到这个目标，每个人都会知道的。这就让招聘经理掌握了这样的权力：“好吧，我怎么才能走出去，认识那些不在我的直接关系网里的人呢？我怎样才能确保我们能把更多来自不同背景的人带到招聘渠道的漏斗里呢？”我们有3倍的女性在工程，我们通常会雇用在这段时间内，通过这一努力。


Jen: Cool.

真酷。

I have a story about how we made a mistake and a really valuable  lesson was how we were going to treat and deal with other future problems like  that. We have a employee resource group called Leverets. That's what we call female employees  of Lever.

我有一个关于我们是如何犯错误的故事，一个非常有价值的教训是，我们将如何对待和处理其他类似的未来问题。我们有一个员工资源组叫做杠杆。这就是我们所说的Lever的女雇员。

It's a Slack channel and a dinner, I think two or three times  a year to talk about issues, resources, mentorship.

这是一个斯拉克频道和一顿晚餐，我想一年两到三次谈论问题、资源和导师关系。

I had found out that about a  year and a half ago somebody had created a private Slack channel called Lever Dudes.  This is a little bit of gray area.

大约一年半前，我发现有人创建了一个名为Lever Dudds的私人Sack频道。这里有点灰色地带。

I think you'll find the pattern in  that the gray areas and they're the awkward, uncomfortable, ambiguous problems are some of the  hardest because if you looked at the channel, there was nothing like super wrong with  it but there was this tone that could be interpreted as a little bit of  mocking.

我想你会发现，灰色地带-它们是尴尬的、不舒服的、模棱两可的问题-是最困难的问题之一，因为如果你看一下频道，它没有什么特别的错误，但是有一种语气可以被解释为有点嘲弄。

It was said something like, "Well, they have a Leverets channel so it's only  fair." There's some jokes that again nothing super crazy but it didn't make people who  were in it actually, other men didn't feel good about it. When it was brought  up to me, we talked about how one of our standards and principles for D&I  is this phrase, "The standard that you …" Sorry. "If you see something say something.  The standard that you walk past is a standard you accept." Even though it's comfortable  it was our job as startup employees as leaders to do something about it. We  reached reach out to one of our founders, Randal, who was incredibly empathetic, listened to  the situation, took it really seriously. The problem here was that, again, I was like  undermining the other Leverets channel in the group, and also, if left alone it could  potentially lead to a little bit of like us-versus-them mentality if it were to grow,  right? He ended up addressing the employee in question, super professionally like not trying to  call him out just saying that like, "Hey, this is not okay so I'd like  to talk about what happened." Again, really trying to understand and listen, but then also  draw the lines. Then this is I think the next part what he did was  really stepping up as a leader, and again, like Stripe, we decided to address it  at our next All Hands.

有人说，“嗯，他们有一个杠杆通道，所以这是公平的。”有一些笑话说，没有什么超级疯狂，但它并没有使人谁在它实际上，其他男人对此感到不舒服。当它向我提出时，我们谈到了我们对D&I的标准和原则之一是这个短语，“你的标准，…”抱歉的“如果你看到什么话，你走过的标准就是你接受的标准。”尽管这很舒服，但作为创业公司的员工，作为领导者，我们的工作就是为此做些什么。我们联系了我们的创始人之一兰德尔，他非常有同情心，倾听了情况，非常认真地对待这件事。这里的问题是，再一次，我就像破坏了集团中其他的杠杆通道，而且，如果不让它一个人，它可能会导致一些类似我们-而不是-他们的心态-如果它要增长的话，对吗？他最后对这位员工进行了采访，他非常专业，就像不想叫他出来，就像这样说：“嘿，这不太好，所以我想谈谈发生了什么。”再一次，真的试着去理解和倾听，然后也画出界限。接下来，我想他所做的就是真正地作为一个领导者，再一次，像斯特里普一样，我们决定在我们的下一个全体成员面前解决这个问题。

I think that's one of our key learnings. You have  to address things.

我认为这是我们学习的关键之一。你必须解决问题。

It's not fun, nobody goes up to All Hands in front of  your entire company saying like this happened and it was super uncomfortable and awkward, but  you have to do it otherwise it becomes an elephant in the room. Randall addressed  the entire company. What's really interesting was that he started the story saying by being  very honest about a mistake that he had made in the past. When the Leverets  group was first formed, and it was just the four of us women just going  out to dinner. He made a joke about like, "Well, maybe I'll grab some of  the engineers and go and get pizza or something," like the same night.

这一点都不好玩，没有人会在你的整个公司面前说这样的事情，它是非常不舒服和尴尬的，但是你必须这样做，否则它就变成了房间里的一只大象。兰德尔向整个公司发表讲话。真正有趣的是，他在一开始就说，他对过去犯过的一个错误非常诚实。刚成立的时候，只有我们四个女人出去吃饭。他开玩笑说，“嗯，也许我会找一些工程师去买披萨什么的，”就像在同一个晚上。

It wasn't  until later he realized that wasn't actually a very, that wasn't what he meant to  say because, again, if you think about why that group exists in the first place  because women may not be minorities but they are minorities in tech. Therefore, they have  experiences, burdens, hardships that you might not even know about. The reason the group exists  is not to have fun and go out and go to drinks and talk about,  I don't know, nail polish.

直到后来，他才意识到这并不是他想要说的，因为，再一次，如果你想一想为什么这个群体会存在，首先是因为女性可能不是少数群体，但她们在技术上是少数群体。因此，他们有经验，负担，困难，你甚至可能不知道。这个团体存在的原因是不开心，出去喝酒，谈论指甲油，我不知道。

It really is about the work and what can we  do to support ourselves, each other, and just for future employees, and future inclusion, and  just being really honest and authentic as a leader I think made a huge difference.  Later that day in Slack, multiple employees both, and also in person, went up to  Randal to thank him, to say things like, "My previous startup founders would never do  anything like that.

它真的是关于我们的工作，以及我们能做些什么来支持我们自己，相互支持，只是为了未来的员工，以及未来的包容，作为一个真正诚实和真实的领导者，我认为这是一个巨大的改变。那天晚些时候，在斯莱克，多名员工和他本人都走到兰德尔跟前感谢他，说：“我以前的初创公司创始人永远不会做那样的事。

I feel really grateful and lucky to work for a place where  the leaders really care about the people, and it's very human and authentic." I think  that was a lesson that we learned.

我感到非常感激和幸运，在一个领导人真正关心人民的地方工作，这是非常人性化和真实的。“我认为这是我们学到的一个教训。

It's not just to address it one on  one, you want to prevent it from happening in the future, very easily a new  hire could have been joining six months later, and the same thing happens over again.  How do you address it head on? Really step up as a leader.

这不仅仅是一个接一个地解决这个问题，你想要防止它在未来发生，一个新的雇员很容易在六个月后加入，而同样的事情又会再次发生。你是怎么解决这个问题的？作为一名领导者真的要挺身而出。

It's not  going to be fun sometimes.

有时候不好玩。

It's not going to be comfortable, but that is your  responsibility. The thing is, people will remember the tone you set, what you say. Your  employees remember, and it gets embedded into the culture as you grow.

不会很舒服，但这是你的责任。问题是，人们会记住你定下的基调，你说的话。你的员工记得，随着你的成长，它就会融入到你的文化中。


Male: Yes. Cat touched on earlier which is this concept of surprise.

男：是的。CAT早些时候提到过，这是一个令人惊讶的概念。

In the first summer,  we had asked certain students to, "Hey, can you zip up your folder and email  it to us?" Students would say, "Hey, I don't know how to zip up a  folder." We'd say, "Wait, you don't know how to zip up a folder. That's like  such a basic thing," but it operates on the assumption that this person has gone  through the same education and upbringing that you have, such that they'll actually know this  thing that you're asking them do. That was a big one, and especially from a  standpoint of a teacher, not a really great thing for a student to hear. The  second one was starting from very early in the company we had a very like  strong voice culture in meetings that we had. Anytime there's some discussion about different topics,  it get pretty heated, voices would raise, not in a, I guess, argumentative or in  a healthy debate way, but it also means the people who are more introverted or  more soft-spoken suddenly don't have as much voice.

在第一个夏天，我们让一些学生说：“嘿，你能把你的文件夹拉好并发电子邮件给我们吗？”学生们会说，“嘿，我不知道怎么拉文件夹。”我们会说，“等等，你不知道怎么拉文件夹。这就像一件基本的事情，”但它的运作假设这个人经历了和你一样的教育和教养，这样他们就会知道你要求他们做的事情。这是一个很大的问题，尤其是从老师的角度来看，对于一个学生来说，这并不是一件很好的事情。第二次是从公司初期开始的，我们在会议上有一种非常强烈的声音文化。每当有关于不同话题的讨论时，它就会变得相当激烈，声音会发出，我想，不是以一种辩论或健康辩论的方式，而是意味着更内向或者更温和的人突然间没有那么多的声音了。

It's really a big problem when you're  including those folks in meetings, and they're not only getting a chance to speak. Those  are I think two big mistakes that we made. The main thing that we've done  from a cultural standpoint to make it, help people work on these mistakes is really  assuming negligence and not malice in this kind of situations, and really focusing on where  people are going as opposed to necessarily where they are. Both my co-founder and I  were quite young when we were starting the company.

当你让那些人参加会议的时候，这真的是个大问题，他们不仅有机会发言。我认为我们犯了两个大错误。我们从文化的角度出发，帮助人们处理这些错误，主要是在这种情况下承担过失而不是恶意，真正关注的是人们的去向，而不是他们所处的位置。我们创办公司的时候，我和我的共同创始人都很年轻。

I had lots of mistakes in  terms of leadership and management.

我在领导和管理方面有很多错误。

It's only because we have a culture where other folks  on the team are willing to understand that we're constantly trying to improve. Similarly, if  you notice some behavior and nuance, say something about it.

这只是因为我们有一种文化，团队中的其他人愿意理解，我们一直在努力改进。同样，如果你注意到一些行为和细微差别，就说点什么吧。

It's important not to make  the person feel that they are a bad person for having said this, but really  just help coach them so that a year from now they'll be a lot better  in this kind of situations.

重要的是不要让人觉得他们说了这些话是个坏人，而是真正帮助他们指导他们，这样从现在起一年后，他们在这种情况下会变得更好。


Kat: Cool. Now, and you've all sort of talked a little bit about some things you're  doing that are going well, but like shifting a little bit from the mistakes that  you've made in the past or that your organizations have made in the past. Let's  start talking about things that you're trying, that you're excited about that are paying off,  that are, that you think are going well in terms of building this great culture  from scratch.

凯特：酷。现在，你们都谈到了一些你们正在做的事情，这些事情进行得很好，但就像从过去犯过的错误或者组织过去犯过的错误中移了一点点。让我们开始谈论那些你正在尝试的事情，那些你为之感到兴奋的事情，那些你认为正在从零开始建立这一伟大文化的成功的事情。


Female: Is it going well for anyone?
Kat: Yeah.

女：这对任何人都好吗？凯特：是的。

I think it's like the thing is like, we know there's no easy button  but if there are any like lights that we can follow.

我认为事情就像，我们知道没有简单的按钮，但如果有类似的灯，我们可以跟随。


Cat Perez: Yeah.

是的。

I can only share what's worked for us. What's worked for us may not  work for everyone. There is no playbook the one size or blueprint that, one size  fits all. For us, at HealthSherpa, what we did when we were hiring is we  leveraged POT tools, not to be mistaken with the other pot. People Ops Tools, that's  what it stands for. One specifically that we use it was called Unitive.

我只能分享对我们有用的东西。对我们有用的东西不一定对每个人都有用。没有一本剧本-一种大小或一幅蓝图-适合所有的人。对我们来说，在HealthSherpa，我们雇佣的时候所做的就是利用罐子工具，而不是误以为是另一个罐子。人民行动工具，这就是它所代表的。我们特别使用的一种叫做“统一”(Unitive)。

It's a  Capital, a portfolio company. They're called now. We used it to run our job descriptions  through it. The job description check would score the job description.

这是一家资本投资公司。现在叫他们。我们用它来分析我们的工作说明。职务说明检查将为职务说明打分。

It would call out  words that were heavily biased. The reason we did that was to obviously cast a  wider net. Super easy tool to use. They had other features like the blind resume  review, as well as scoring questions and making sure that each person who was interviewing  a candidate was asking every single person the same question, and those questions map back  to competencies and skills that you need.

它会发出带有严重偏见的话。我们这么做的原因显然是为了投出更大的网。超级容易使用的工具。他们还有其他的特点，比如盲目的简历审查，以及打分问题，确保每个面试候选人的人问的都是同一个问题，这些问题反映了你所需要的能力和技能。

It's not this, when you're startup you're going  to do things in a scrappy way, but we finally built some structure around our  interview process. What we ended up finding after rolling out that one initiative is we  ended up hitting our diversity goals. We 2x are Hispanic, Latina hires and team members  as well as our black team members as well.

不是这样的，当你开始创业的时候，你会以一种混乱的方式做事，但是我们最终围绕着我们的面试过程建立了一些结构。我们在推出后发现，一项倡议是我们最终实现了我们的多样性目标。我们2倍是西班牙裔，拉丁裔员工和团队成员，以及我们的黑人团队成员。

It totally worked. Another thing I  like to throw in there as we had that new team using leveraging that initiative,  is we had a plus 85% revenue growth as well.

完全成功了。另一件事，我喜欢投入到那里，因为我们有一个新的团队利用这一倡议，是我们有一个额外的85%的收入增长，以及。

I would like to attribute  that to the team that we had in place.

我想把这归功于我们的团队。

It's just a testament to the  fact that hiring diverse team members, especially when you're serving diverse communities really does impact  your bottom line.

这只是一个事实的证明，雇用不同的团队成员，特别是当你服务于不同的社区确实影响你的底线。


Male: Yeah.

男：是啊。

I actually get this question a lot because of what our organization is. A  lot of founders of small companies will come up and ask, "Hey, how do I  hire more Latin X or black or female engineers?" What I usually actually tell them  is, "Look, if your company is 4, 5, 10 people what you should really think  about is what are the attributes and skills that you need on the team and  be really honest about those things." For example, if you're building an Ag tech company,  right? All of your employees are from cities. That may not be the most effective  thing when you're trying to sell and no one has ever been on a farm.  I think it's like step one for me is really taking a really honest look  at what you need your employees to be able to do, and what specific things  matter to you at the stage that you're at. Then hiring against those things, as  opposed to just trying to like check the boxes or make your numbers look a  certain way because you know when you're larger, the press will be looking at your  stats. Figure out what's important to you at your stage. Then hire against that.  I think the thing that we probably have done best is start early. We started  thinking about this when we were two and three people. That's important both because the  people that you hire early on are eventually going to go on to be the  leaders at your company and hire their own teams. You want to make sure that  you're building the team now that you eventually want to have.

事实上，我非常了解这个问题，因为我们的组织是什么。很多小公司的创始人会问：“嘿，我怎么才能雇佣更多的拉丁X或黑人或女性工程师呢？”我通常告诉他们的是，“听着，如果你的公司是4，5，10个人，你应该真正考虑的是你在团队中所需要的特质和技能，并且要诚实地对待这些事情。”例如，如果你在建立一家银科技公司，对吗？你所有的员工都来自城市。这可能不是最有效的东西，当你试图出售，而且从来没有人在一个农场。我认为，对我来说，第一步是真正诚实地审视你需要员工做些什么，以及在你所处的阶段，具体的事情对你有什么影响。然后雇佣那些东西，而不是仅仅是想要检查框或使你的数字看起来一定的方式，因为你知道，当你更大，媒体会看你的统计数字。在你的舞台上找出什么对你很重要。那就用它来对付。我认为我们可能做得最好的就是早点开始。我们在两到三岁的时候就开始考虑这个问题了。这两者都很重要，因为你早期雇佣的人最终会成为你公司的领导者，并雇佣他们自己的团队。你想要确保你正在建立团队，现在你最终想拥有这个团队。

It's also important because  if you end up as a team of 15 white and Asian dudes sitting in  a room and start trying to incorporate diversity into your team at that point, good  luck, because, I mean, people don't want to be a token diversity candidate or feel  alienated by a culture that's already in place. That's a big one. We've also been  pretty proactive. You mentioned blinding the resume or putting together good job descriptions. That at  a very early stage is not quite enough because you're working with a much smaller  funnel. We've been very proactive about saying, "No. We're actually seeking out people of different  backgrounds and different cultures to try to incorporate them into the team early on." Partnering  with like different organizations that can help broaden your recruiting funnel there was something that  we, I think, did well early on.  For us talking about these issues and whether it's community, culture, diversity and talking about  them at effectively reset points. For our education programs when the programs actually start is  a really good time, but with the company if you can't always go back and  reset to the very beginning so at a company off-site let's say in January right  after everyone's come back from winter break, usually is a good time to address these  topics because whatever impression you set and whatever culture you start building in the first  few weeks of the new year will typically last throughout the year. The second piece  is providing mentorship, especially for our students, providing mentorship of people who look like them  and feel like them. We have one of our alums, Leslie, who actually works at  Lever. She's been amazing in terms of creating a support group for our current female  students in our college program. That's gone a really long way to helping that. Then,  finally, just talking about the numbers.

这也很重要，因为如果你最终成为一个由15名白人和亚洲人组成的团队，然后开始尝试将多样性融入你的团队，祝你好运，因为，我的意思是，人们不想成为一个象征性的多元化候选人，或者感到被一种已经存在的文化所疏远。那可是个大案子。我们也非常积极主动。你提到过把简历弄瞎或者把好的工作描述写在一起。这在一个非常早期的阶段是不够的，因为你用的是一个小得多的漏斗。我们一直非常积极地说：“不。我们实际上是在寻找不同背景和不同文化的人，以便尽早将他们融入团队。”与不同的组织合作，帮助你拓宽招聘漏斗，我认为，我们很早就做得很好。对于我们来说，谈论这些问题，以及它是否是社区，文化，多样性，并谈论它们的有效重置点。对于我们的教育项目来说，当课程真正开始的时候，确实是一个很好的时机，但是如果你不能总是回到公司的起点，那么在一家公司以外的地方，比方说，在一月份每个人都从寒假回来之后，通常是讨论这些话题的好时机，因为无论你给人留下什么样的印象，也不管你开始了什么文化。新年前几周的建筑通常会持续一年。第二部分是提供导师服务，特别是为我们的学生提供指导，为那些长得像他们、感觉像他们的人提供指导。我们有一个校友，莱斯利，他在利弗工作。在我们的大学项目中，她为我们目前的女学生创建了一个支持小组，她一直很棒。对此有很大帮助。最后，只是说说数字。

It's not … You shouldn't be ashamed if your  numbers are not very diverse. Last year, the first year of our college program we  had one girl out of about 22 students which was not great, but we still  talked about that and we thought about how can we actively improve that and because  it was open, an open dialogue, we could think about how to make plans to  address that. Now, we have about 7 girls out of 40 or 36 students and  100% retention throughout the year, which is a big improvement for last year. For both  programs as well as for the staff we've started talking about the numbers when they  weren't great, and then, continue to increase and improve them year over year.

不是…如果你的数字不是很多样化，你就不应该感到羞愧。去年，我们大学项目的第一年，我们的22名学生中有一个女生不是很好，但我们仍然在讨论这个问题，我们还在思考如何积极改进这个问题，因为它是开放的，公开的对话，我们可以考虑如何制定计划来解决这个问题。现在，我们在40或36名学生中约有7名女生，全年保持100%，这对去年来说是一个很大的进步。对于这两个项目以及工作人员来说，我们已经开始在他们不是很好的时候谈论这些数字，然后，继续逐年增加和改进这些数字。


Female: How are we doing on time?
Kat: If you could each one minute, and then, I think I'll … Yeah. Sorry.

女：我们准时过得怎么样？凯特：如果你能每一分钟，然后，我想我会…嗯抱歉的


Jen: Yeah.

珍：是的。

I'll keep it short then. You're hearing a lot of answers both on the  diversity side and inclusion side, and I can talk a lot about there, but one  thing that I think adding on to those two at the end said, really figure  out what works for your company that might not be for every other company. For  us, we are a SaaS organization.

那我就少说了。你听到了很多关于多样性和包容性的答案，我可以在那里谈很多，但是我认为在最后添加到这两个方面的一件事是，真正地找出什么对你的公司有效，而不是对其他每一个公司都是有效的。对我们来说，我们是一个SaaS组织。

In that, we have a quite a large sales  part of the company. Another very common association with like what makes a really good  sales person is that like, "Oh, we should get some athletes in here, right? Like  athletes are the best salespeople." I have no doubt that some of the best salespeople  are in fact previous athletes, but that doesn't mean that if you weren't an athlete  you're going to be not good enough.

在这方面，我们在公司有相当大的一部分销售。另一个很常见的联想是，“哦，我们应该在这里找一些运动员，对吧？就像运动员是最好的销售人员一样。”我毫不怀疑一些优秀的销售人员实际上是以前的运动员，但这并不意味着如果你不是一名运动员，你就会不够优秀。

It really took to examining some of these  biases and beliefs that we have in the valley and workplaces in general and really  looking at, is that actually true and is that going to work for us at  Lever? We've been able to have … Yeah. Just make the previous athletic, previous college  athletic experience required like taking that out of job descriptions, and making sure people are  not being punished or feeling like they're being left out because they didn't have this  certain background.

它真的需要检查我们在山谷和工作场所中的一些偏见和信仰，并真正地观察，这真的是真的吗，这会在杠杆上为我们工作吗？我们已经有了…嗯只需让以前的运动经验，以前的大学体育经验，比如把它从工作描述中删除，并确保人们没有受到惩罚，或感觉他们被忽视，因为他们没有这个特定的背景。


Cristina C.: Last thing I'll say is we did probably 20 things to improve our intern diversity  for this past year.

克里斯蒂娜C：我要说的最后一件事是，在过去的一年里，我们可能做了20件事情来改善我们的实习生的多样性。

In 2016, we had 11% women and underrepresented minorities in our  intern class, which was failure, mistake. This year we had over 41% women and underrepresented  minorities in our intern class. We over double the intern program.

2016年，我们的实习班有11%的女性和少数族裔代表不足，这是失败的，是错误的。今年，我们的实习班有超过41%的妇女和少数族裔代表不足。我们的实习计划翻了一番。

I would say one  of the things that we did in particular that had that effect was we created  multiple ways to actually get into our intern pipeline. Your traditional way of showing up  at a career fair, for example, or applying to our website were still ways that  we looked at candidates, but we found that all the other technology companies were looking  at those exact same candidates. You are looking at the same candidates that had two  other great internships at Google and Facebook et cetera. You were all fighting over those  particular candidates. When the reality is you're looking for capabilities at the internship stage. You're  not necessarily looking for people who have tons of experience because the likelihood is, if  you're in college you probably don't have very much experience at all. How can we  hunt for people who are like have those fantastic capabilities that we need that we  think are going to do really well at Stripe? One of the things that we  did was create two additional application paths. One was a coding challenge that you could  do in your own free time. Then submit that challenge to us, and you'd actually  go straight to a phone interview. You didn't even have to talk to a recruiter.  The other path was a show us your code option. We went to a bunch  of events like Black Society of Engineers at certain different colleges, the Grace Hopper et  cetera. We said, "If you just take out your computer and show us a project  of something that you've built.

我想说的是，我们所做的事情之一，尤其是产生了这样的效果，那就是我们创造了多种方法来真正进入我们的实习生管道。例如，你在招聘会上的传统表现方式，或者申请我们网站的方式，仍然是我们调查候选人的方式，但我们发现，所有其他科技公司都在关注那些完全相同的候选人。你看到的是同样的候选人，他们在谷歌(Google)和Facebook等公司有过另外两次出色的实习机会。你们都在为那些特定的候选人而争吵。当现实是你在实习阶段寻找能力。你不一定要找有大量经验的人，因为很可能，如果你在大学，你可能根本没有太多的经验。我们怎样才能找到那些拥有我们认为在Stripe会做得很好的神奇能力的人呢？我们所做的事情之一是创建两个额外的应用程序路径。一个是编码挑战，你可以在自己的空闲时间完成。然后把挑战提交给我们，你就会直接去参加电话面试。你甚至不用跟招聘人员谈。另一条路是向我们展示你的代码选项。我们参加了一些活动，比如某些不同学院的黑人工程师协会，格蕾丝·霍珀(GraceHopper)等等。我们说，“如果你拿出你的电脑，给我们看一个你做的东西的项目。

If we think the code is good like you automatically  get to next stage." How can we think about candidates as more than just their  resume especially when in reality at a college stage the resume probably doesn't really matter  that much.

如果我们认为这段代码很好，就像你自动进入下一阶段一样。“我们怎么能认为候选人不仅仅是他们的简历，尤其是在大学阶段的现实中，简历可能并不那么重要。


Kat: Yeah. All right. We are time. Thank you all for sharing all your stories.

凯特：是的。好的我们是时候了。谢谢大家分享你们所有的故事。

I  realize a lot of you are pre-hiring. You aren't thinking about some of these issues  but I'm going to, I created a resource list.

我知道你们中的很多人都是在招聘前。您没有考虑其中的一些问题，但我要这样做，我创建了一个资源列表。

It's a living document.

这是一份活生生的文件。

I will  list everything that you guys mentioned. All the resources and tools that you've used and  where Steven is going to be sharing that with the class and with everyone online.  Jen, I'd wanted you to talk a little bit about the framework for creating like  ongoing D&I programs, but I'm just going to have you since we don't have time,  I will hopefully work with you on a blog that you can blog post and  Lever also has an incredible series.

我会列出你们提到的一切。你所使用的所有资源和工具，以及史蒂文将与全班和在线所有人分享这些资源和工具的地方。Jen，我想让你谈谈关于创建像正在进行的D&I程序的框架，但是我只是要有你，因为我们没有时间，我希望和你一起写一个博客，你可以在博客上发表，Lever也有一个令人难以置信的系列。

It's a 10-part series that walks through D&I for  companies that I also added on the resources list of great places to start if  you're looking to read up more on this. We will be sharing that list with  you and also putting together all your notes, and then, anything else that we missed.  This is such a meaty topic, and there's a lot here, but thank you also  for listening. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions that you have  either for the speakers or for me.

这是一个由10部分组成的系列文章，内容包括公司的D&I，如果你想阅读更多关于这方面的内容，我也会把它添加到资源列表中，让你从更好的地方开始。我们将与你分享这份清单，并把你所有的笔记，然后，我们错过的任何其他东西。这是一个很丰富的话题，这里有很多，但也谢谢你的倾听。请随时向我提出任何问题，无论是为发言者或为我。

I'm Kat. K-A-T@ .com and I can connect  you to any of these ladies and gentlemen if that's desired. Thank you again. Thank  you. A round of applause.
