# How to Invent the Future I - Alan Kay

Sam: We have Allen K with us this week, he's going to do both lectures. Allen  K has forgotten more about how to invent the future than the rest of us  put together ...

Allen K: That would make very bad class, Sam. But yeah ...

Sam: I think Allen is the genuine world expert on this inventive with others, the 0  X alto, which we recently restored, with a group of incredible computer scientists, and I  think it is the person who has been the most thoughtful, probably of anyone I've  ever met about how you build organizations to do real innovations. So thank you very  much for coming, I am super excited to hear this.

Allen K: Great Sam. Well I'm thoughtful about it because I got to watch masters do it,  I'm basically a research scientist but I was interested in the process done by far  better managers than me, who could deal with larger sets of ideas and I'll try  to give you a gist here. Basically, I think because people are here because they're,  they want to do start-ups and make money, I just want to point out that  if you want to make money, don't bother with a startup, create an industry. Because  then you get trillions instead of billions. So it's about a factor of a 1000  between doing invention over innovation. In other words, not going incrementally from the present. But  carving out a whole new set of ideas, it creates an entirely new context. We'll  see some of the ways to go about it and we'll also see some of  the barriers, let's see if this, this has a bad user interface because it has  the back button here to front button ... Let's see if that works. So, a  lot of what these two days are about are talking about the place that most  people naturally live, which is the present. But the problem with the present is that  it is so flittery and distracting, there is so much stuff going on, that it's  hard to think about anything but the present and if you're thinking about the present  your ideas are going to be derived from the present and therefore they're going to  be incremental and therefore you wind up doing innovation. It's not that you can't make  money that way. But, today I'm going to do my ... The opposite of my  usual order. I usually like to build a lot of context first but I thought  in the spirit of the Harvard Business School, and the equivalent at Stanford I'd start  off with things like results and process and methods first so you have a feeling  that I'm actually saying something that you might quote on quote "Apply". But the important  talk is really Thursday, I'm still struggling with making it the right size, so today  we're going to do that and I urge you to copy my email address. I  love emails. We're not going to have the discussion we should have, here, I welcome  any questions. And by the way, while I'm talking I welcome questions at any time.  Don't be shy. Okay? And, here's why school pisses me off. Great man in our  field, Marvin Minsky observed that this is the best place ever to keep you from  ever thinking about anything for long enough. So you don't want to try and learn  in a classroom, it's terrible. In face, I don't like to do classroom process. Partially  because of the time constraints, but also because it's oral. We might as well be  sitting around a campfire 100 000 years ago. And almost everything that's happened that's important  in the last, several thousands of years, has been basically literary informed. Okay? So, one  of my favorite Picasso sayings, and he meant a lot of different things by this,  "Part of it is the best you can ever do with any kind of representations  is make, kind of a map. Even when you're trying to make a map of  a map. You're making a lie compared to the thing you're trying to represent, but  if you do it right, people can gain some intuition about what the map is  about". That's what science is all about, this talk in 50 minutes has to be  a lie. It really is, I'm leaving out a lot of important things. And, but  I think the shadow of the talk or whatever is projected by the talk is  pretty close to the way things actually are for doing this very different process. And  a think that Picasso didn't say but he knew and he meant is art is  also the lie that tells the trust that wakes you up. So if something wakes  you up in the next two days, I will have done my job. And then,  the two days are really about another Picasso quote which is "Learn the rules like  a pro so you can break them like an artist." And not doing this is  probably the greatest sin of Silicon Valley since the 80s. Almost never, nobody has bothered  becoming a pro. Particularly in software and user interface design. And so when they break  the rules, they're breaking them like a dumb child does, by throwing rocks through windows.  And it's probably the most sickening thing to see about the field. So, another way  of thinking about the mantra is you have to learn everything and then find a  way of forgetting it so you can have your own ideas but, what you forget  is everything except the perfume, so when you have an idea then your nose will  pickup the right scent and you'll be able to make use of all the stuff  that you've learned after you've had the idea. I was specifically asked to talk about  Xerox PARC because that was an example of making trillions instead of billions, and so  I thought, "What I'll do here is just show you a couple of results from  Xerox PARC" and I'll then try to give you some of what it took to  get those results. So Xerox PARC is known for this machine that happened, I gave  one to Sam. He got it working with the help of some really great people,  so this machine happened in 1973, which is 11 years before the Mac and it's  screen was more than twice the size of the Mac and ... It was more  like a Mac of 1988 or 1989. So it was about, maybe 15 or 16  years ahead of the commercial development and the commercial development actually was based on the  stuff that was done on this machine. So this is an example of the best  way to predict the future, is to invent it. There was nothing like this before,  once we did it people could see, "Oh yeah, there could be something like this,  because here it is". In fact we made 2000 of these. So there was a  lot to look at. They had bitmap screens, they had pointing device, the famous Gui,  which you're still using today. Wizzy Wig means what you see is what you get,  desktop publishing and the whole media gig ... What does that say ... That's not  helping me ... Can anybody read that? Oh yeah, symmetrical reading and writing, meaning what  you almost never get on the web but that you did get in many of  the apps of the 1980s which is when you get a document the thing that  you read the document with also allows you to edit the document. So if you  think about the web, it's actually much more made for consumption than it is for  authoring. They are completely decoupled. Most of the authoring facilities are typing in tiny little  windows and then pushing a button to see what you did. So this is a  vast retrogression. What we call real-loop these days, we just called it object oriented programming  back then. I made up that term. But, what's called object oriented programming today is  not what we had back then, and I don't think that I'll have time to  really talk about the profound differences. Suffice to say that what we did at PARC  became popular and everybody wanted it even if they only got the label. Comparison is,  you can go out and buy a set of designer jeans with the label Harvard  on them and for all I know it was Stanford on them. A laser printer,  main difference between this and what you have today is, it was, the first one  was a page a second. So most people have never printed with a page a  second printer. Post script, outline fonts and so forth. The ethernet, peer to peer and  client server, and 50% of the internet PARC did an internet before there was the  internet. And we're part of that community so we participated in the official internet. So  we think of that as eight and a half inventions, how long did it take?  Well 25 researchers for five years. Think about that. Two dozen people did all of  these things in about five years. Cost about 10 to 12 million bucks a year  in today's money, return is about 35 trillion, this is an old number. Its probably  more like 40, now. So that's pretty good return on investment, think about it. If  you like to do little spread-sheets and stuff. 15% is good, right Sam? Yeah. So,  it was an industry rather than an increment. People say, "Well, but Xerox didn't benefit  from this, they didn't make any money from this". Complete bullshit. It's made up by  companies who don't want to invest in research. Xerox made about a factor of 250  over their entire investment in PARC. So that's 25000% return right there. Xerox's bug was  that it didn't understand the rest of the stuff, but they certainly understood was a  laser printer was and they made billions from it. And in fact, if you look  at it, it was better for the world that they stone-walled us. Because, no single  company can handle an entire industry. So this made it possible. The Japanese had to  do printers slightly different than that. And this kind of heaven on earth lasted for  about 12 years, Xerox finally fired the guy who made it all happen. You'd think  he would have been rewarded, right? Because he made all this stuff happen. But in  fact, they hated him, and they hated him for the reason that most companies hate  people who are doing something different, because it makes middle management and upper management extremely  uncomfortable. The last thing they want to do is make trillions. What they want to  do is make a few millions in a comfortable way. And so, this leads to  an enormous problem that where the, the real job of upper management in the 20  and 21st century is to learn things. Because change is the constant thing that's going  on. What they try to do is to maximize whatever they had when they got  into the job and whatever the company was successful at. Think about it. If large  companies were actually rationale, there'd never be a small company. There'd be no startups because  large companies have vastly more resources for doing new things than any venture capitalist. Right  Sam? They've got gazillions of money. But because they refuse to get into new businesses,  and refuse to change the old businesses, you guys have a chance. So just pray  that they don't ever wake up. Now the interesting thing is that if you look  at that collection of inventions, you see every single one of them today. And what's  interesting is if I were to enlarge this a bit, I would show that there's  hardly been anything interesting invented since this funding stopped. So it's been a nuclear winter  of people cashing in on these inventions and extracting the wealth from them. But hardly  any efforts of any interesting kind to go beyond them. And last point here is  the lack of curiosity. Sam is a huge ... I bet Sam because he wanted  to know where'd all this stuff come from. I've hardly ever been asked that question.  It's the most successful generation of wealth in computing history and almost nobody wants to  know. Sam did. And the difficult thing about today and Thursday is the world that  you grew up in, because I don't see anybody ... Is anybody here older than  35? Okay. I see a little more reflectivity back there. Yeah, so almost everybody in  the room grew up in a world that's unlike the world I'm going to just  tell you about now. So it's just ... Many many things were qualitatively different in  ways that are sometimes difficult to explain. So here's the book to read, this is  why lectures suck. This is a 500 page book done very carefully about the whole  story of RPA and Xerox PARC. Anybody who's really interested, read this book. This is  a tribute I wrote to this whole research community about, I don't know, 14-15 years  ago. And I'm ... I'll hand it out at the end of the class. The  main thing that's interesting about it perhaps is the bibliography which has a lot of  references on more detailed things you can read about how this particular community operated. Right?  And the important thing about Xerox PARC which is not emphasized enough is that PARC  was jut another one of the RPA research projects. So, there's eight years of research  before PARC happened and PARC only happened because of the Vietnam war. Nobody wanted to  do this stuff inside of a company, the company quarterly cycles and everything are really  antithetical to long range thinking, so this stuff was all funded by Cold War funds  in the public domain. So none of the IP was kept secret. But it was  done in a better rhythm so to get the 35 trillion, it actually required not  five years, but 12 to 14 years. We were the lucky researchers who got our  PhDs in this process, and we're the right age to go to PARC and finish  it off. Right? And as we'll see, I'm not going to dwell on it much  more, but the zeitgeist of doing this way of doing things go back to the  ... Specially the radar effort and MIT. And the air defense effort and then RPA  and then PARC. So there's a long continuity here of kind of, how do you  work on things that are ... That are doable but where you have to invent  several generations of technology to get to the thing that's doable. Most of these things  are not doable with the technology that's lying around, that is the problem with these  hard problems. Okay, so the general world, the normal world, the present, for most of  this period was either punch-card accounting machines or their replacement, after IBM said famously "There's  no room for more than five or six computers in the entire world", they wound  up doing the first mass produced computer, the 1401, the first computer I ever programmed.  To replace their punch-card machines before other computer companies did, so they did a sort  of Trump like reversal on their belief. And wound up owning the 60s and much  of the 70s. And most important thing ... This is a dumb sentence because you  don't know what these machines were like. So I realized after I put it in  there that, "Why did I even put this sentence in?" Right? But it, the way  I look at what's going on at any given time, whether it's today, 30 or  40 years ago is, whatever is going on right now is just crap. By definition.  If we know about it, except in the one tenth of one percent, or one  thousandth of one percent, it's gotten mundane. And part of it is just because of  the bell curve of normality in humans. Whatever it is, it gets converted to something  like normal, no matter how exciting it is. And so, when things are widely successful,  they tend to bring up the ... The mean of the bell curve a little  bit for everybody, raises all boats, but in fact there's also this regression to the  mean on almost all of these things, so living in the present ... Man, you're  out of, you're just out of it. If you're trying to think about things from  what we have now. Now the ... There are two processes ... There's the bomb  project, and the radar project at MIT that had roughly the same process, roughly the  same difficult ... You have to realize the US is in World War Two for  only about two and a half years. Right? Pearl Harbor was December of 1941, and  so we had 42, 43, 44, 43 and a half years and a lot of  things got done. The most interesting thing is for the first time in history really,  a lot of really scientists and a lot of really good engineers started working together.  And cloning each other. So seven Nobel prizes came out of the building 20 thing  ... Because they were physicists who put on their engineering hats to make 185 different  kinds of radar systems and install them in every size of building and plane and  ... Boat, and World War Two was basically a war of supply. And it was  the ability to stave off the German submarines that actually won the war for us.  Most people don't think of it that way, but that's what happened. So, it the  zeitgeist I'm talking about, came out of this group and there's a couple of good  books about how these people went about ... Doing things. Maybe then number one thing  is what I ... Have on the right hand side. Is said, "Forget about your  egos, and I really meant it, doesn't matter who you are, how smart you are,  how smart you think you are, there's only one that counts here, is making progress.  And we make progress through synergy". And they learned how to do this and they  pass it on generation after generation. Well the next round of this after World War  Two was the Cold War, and the air defense system that was done in the  50s, and again at MIT the first displays that you could interact with ... That  is essentially a stylus in the guy's hand, it was called the Light Gun. So  he's pointing at something on the screen and he's squeezing the trigger like he would  put a stylus down and he would push it down and the light gun can  tell ... A computer can tell what the light gun is looking at, and so  you can do all of the stuff that you used to today. To give you  an idea of what these guys did, I can't really see what this is, right?  It's just like ... It's obviously four floors of a building, this is a football  field, and if you notice the second floor there, it says computer A, and computer  B, each one of those computers had 50 000 vacuum tubes. Both running the same  programs at the same time and many other interesting things I don't have time to  talk about, but I'll just say that one of these computers started crashing, it took  three or four days to crash, and the reason is it was running diagnostics on  itself and every time there was an instruction failed, it would patch in a simulated  instruction based on what instructions were still working. So what would happen is the machine  would jut get slower and slower and more software like, more like a Turing machine.  Usually they could fix it before it came all the way down, meanwhile the other  one was still working. But even though I shouldn't be digressing, there's a fun thing  here that, there are 32 of these concrete bunkers made. So two interesting thing, what  happened to this stuff? Anybody know? Does this look like anything you've ever seen before?
Speaker 3: Space programs ?
Allen K: Nope, but that's ...

Speaker 3: Airline radars, sorry.

Allen K: Yeah! Yeah. This actually was the invention of our air traffic control system. That's what  it was designed to do, except it was designed to control traffic of both American  and Russian bombers. And in fact if many of the displays before they replaced them  with flat screen displays were this ... Basically the same big round things so this  whole system lasts until 1982, when the last one was finally decommissioned and 50 000  vacuum tubes were like incandescent light bulbs, they blow out. They're always blowing out. So  of course, they are redundant ones there. Where do we get the vacuum tubes from?  Think about it. All the way through this .  Huh?  No. No, this is vacuum ... There's not transistors in these machines. No transistors, these  are the ...  Absolutely. How did you know that?
Speaker 5: I've heard of it before.

Allen K: Yeah. That's good then, you remembered. That's good, yeah. For the last twelve or eighteen  years of this defense system, which was never used against the Russians ever, cause they  never tried to bomb us and, was actually obsolete very soon because of ICBMs, it  couldn't track them. It was a whole other system for doing that. Yeah, but we  kept it going and there are reasons why it kept going. We bought ... While  we're still contending in the Russian for the Cold War, we're buying vacuum tubes from  them to ... And by the way people still keep buying vacuum tubes from the  Russians for getting old 50s guitar amp sounds. Those over driven sounds, and this guy  who was one of the inventors of artificial intelligence and the inventor of the programming  language Lisp, John McCarthy looked at one of these in the 50s and said, "Everyone  is going to have one in their home some day". Because he didn't give a  shit about the concrete bunkers and anything else like that, cause what he thought was,  "Yeah, this is like ... We get ... This is like an electric power generating  station". Nobody ever sees them, but they're out there, we have wires going into the  home for it's like where we get our water from, it's where we get our  gas from. So utilities, he thought, "Oh there will be an ... Be an information  utility and it will actually be a human right like the telephone to have one  of these things in your home that is connected to all the world's information". So  that was one of the earliest and most influential ideas. 1962, I'm going to show  you a system done on one of these super computers, this was done on the  test computer at Lincoln Labs for this whole sage system, so it's ... This computer  was close to the size of this entire building, with one guy on it at  three o'clock in the morning, so take a look at this. This is Ivan Sutherland.  So it doesn't even really have a display. It's actually simulating a computer display here,  this is just in a cycloscope. So, what Ivan wants to do is to draw  flange and so he says "Okay, it's kind of like this, now, take these guys  and make them all mutually perpendicular, and ... Wow, Sketch Pad just solved that problem!".  So it's a dynamic problem solver in there, first window de-clipped, now he wants to  put a hole in the flange. So these are guidelines and the first thing he  does is said "Okay, I want to make these parallel" and see Sketch Pad keeps  them on the line there and lines them up and now he's using them as  guidelines to draw dash lines. You'll see here he misses ... Oh, okay. Okay, and  now he makes the guidelines invisible, they're still there. The constraint was co-linearity there. And  has a knob to continuously zoom. So this is the first computer graphics ever. And  he wants the rivets to go in and go along with that flange and so  again he, this is why the system was called Sketch Pad because you just casually  draw, it's going to use that as the center for the arc here. And again,  he's going to say, "Take these guys and make them mutually perpendicular" and here Sketch  Pad solves that problem, so you wind up with a symmetric object. And ... He  can ... Change things and he'll get another solution, he could have constrained the side  lengths to be ratios of each other. And the kind of problem solving this system  could do were included non-linear problems, so there was , a rivet, and what's cool  about this is that as a master of this, what we call a class and  object oriented programming, so this is not that rivet but an instance of that master  rivet. You might wonder, "Why is the display bouncing around like that?" Well it's putting  up every dot individually at about half the power of this super computer is being  used to just do that. So here's another instance of the rivet, here's another one,  here's another one. And he says, "Oops, I didn't want to have those crossbars there,  so I'll go back to the master rivet and make the crossbars invisible, they're still  there but invisible", and we see the instances. So this is object oriented programming. Maybe  nicer that you've seen it. Get rid of those guys. And now, that construction that  he made, he's made it into a master and so he can make instances of  it. Okay? Get the idea?
Speaker 6: No, I have a question.

Allen K: Yes.

Speaker 6: What has gone wrong to have sort of ... Regressed from here?
Allen K: Well, anybody in this class ever seen Sketch Pad before? Okay, so, that's part of  the answer. Yeah. We'll pick that ... It's sort of the larger question that we  have to ... It's worthwhile bringing up the question rotating three of them. So this  is the most shocking thing I had ever seen when I went to graduate school  in 66. This system was only three years ... Old at that time, and I'd  been programming for five years and just, conventional programming and ... Seeing this, it blew  my mind. Because it was exactly different that everything I'd ever thought about computing. As  soon as I saw it, I realized, "Oh yeah, of course you can do that".  But I didn't think about that. Ivan did. Okay. So, Sketch Pad, interactive computer graphics,  and the way we recognize today for the first time, objects, masters and instances, the  programming was not done by the a kind of program today, but by problem solving  which I think you can imagine is much nicer. Like it will find a solution.  And, it creates automatic dynamics, so simulations. So, it's not just for drawing bridges. When  you draw the bridge in, it knows how to simulate the bridge and tell you  what distresses and strains are. So I said to Ivan, "Ivan, you did all of  this in one ..." this was his PhD thesis. I said, "You did all this  in one year by yourself, how could you possibly do it" and he said, "Well  I didn't know it was hard". He just went after what the problem is. And  if you read his thesis, and you should, cause you can see there are things  that are of absolute goodness still today. Its not just relatively good for being done  more than 50 years, it's absolutely good. And his thesis is every other page is  an apology because it doesn't do more. Because Ivan was working on the problem. He  wasn't working on what you could do, he was working on the problem. Yeah. So  Sketch Pad was a bomb shell in this research community. It was about to happen,  cause right away you were looking at the future. You just had to believe that  a room ... A building sized computer was going to wind up on a laptop,  or even something at a desk. So the other ... The main player here back  then was a guy by the name of Lick, Lick Lyder, he got given some  money in 1962, by RPA before the Dee and when everybody asked him what are  you going to do, this is what he would say, "Computers are destined to become  interactive, intellectual amplifiers for everyone in the world universally network world wide". He would not  say anything more. Simply gave that money. And now here's some bullet points, I hate  bullet points. But, this is a perfect class I think to put bullet points in.  And I found 16 that will tell you just what you have to do, and  I've thought of a few since but 16 is more than enough. So the first  thing is just picking an idea that's worth dedicating your life if necessary to. So,  this stuff was human destiny, fixing big human problems, like we can't think very well.  We need to make things to help us to think, we need to make things  to help us cooperate. So these were save the world kind of ideas. And they  were done when the Russians were starting to test Hydrogen bombs and things did not  look so good. Forget about goals. The problem is that goals try to be much  more idiosyncratic to individual humans. So research wants to be a vision, so notice there  aren't any goals in the RPA dream. And that allowed Lick Lyder to fund 15  or 20 super smart people who thought they had ways of approaching the dream and  some of these people didn't ... Agree and some of them hated each other. And  Lick didn't give a shit. He just wanted smart people working on this dream. So  fund people not projects. RPA never decided and we'll see a slight modification of this,  but basically fund people not projects. If you're going to do that, you better have  the very best people, so if you know MaCarthur grants are for individuals, but this  funding was funding groups. Like you fund a MaCarthur. Just five years, forget it. Nobody  in MaCarthur asks ... You never get a second MaCarthur grant. Here they would get  another grant if they'd done something good in five years, but basically idea of MaCarthur  is throw away. We've identified this person of extreme potential, let's just give them five  years of funding and we won't cry if they don't do anything. It turns out  most MaCarthur people do do something because the people that attract attention are people who  are not working for money. They're doing it because they must. Dear people like artists  are people who do their art because they must. Community not a project. Have to  fund problem finding. This really drives funders crazy today. What I mean by that, most  of the time when you're working on hard problems, you don't know what the right  problem is. This is why visions are really good. Visions are detached. If you pick  a problem too early you might be picking it out of the current context. And  therefore you're going to be hampered unless you're incredibly lucky. So RPA put a lot  of money into just people dicking around with stuff. Milestones not deadlines, baseball not golf.  Meaning, when you lose a stroke in golf you cry, when you strike out in  baseball you better not cry. Because you're going to do it a lot. And this  is what Lick Lyder said to them, he said "Look, if you're batting 350 in  baseball you're really doing well" and if you look at what we're funding if we  bat 350, we're going to change the world. That's what happened. Nobody cares about all  the stuff that didn't work. And people said, "Well what about the 65% failure?" And  they said well it's not failure in baseball, it's overhead. Hitting a ball is hard,  and when you're doing something really really hard, the times you don't do it well  is zest overhead for doing it the times you do well. And this is the  probably the biggest distinction that business people do not understand. Cause what they want is  actually tiny little uninteresting projects that are guaranteed for success. But sports is right in  front of us. Sports is a really ... Hard and most sports people are not  succeeding all the time. The thing, what's the thing ... The thing in ... Anybody  know baseball here? What's the thing in baseball that's called an error? Like what?  No, just fielding.

Speaker 7: Oh, error.

Allen K: Yeah, what's an error in baseball? Not catching a fly ball. How good are the  average fielders? They're 98.5% effective. So really good ones are like 1% error, so an  error in technical stuff is designed to build a computer system and failing to build  it. Like anybody should be able ... Or deciding to build a software system and  failing to build it. You just should be able to knock that off. But you're  in this other range when you're trying to do design. And it's really two different  things. So here's a memo Lick wrote. In 63, shortly after he got this initial  money from RPA to members and affiliates of the intergalactic computing network. And they asked  him, "Why did you call it that" and he said, "Well engineers always give you  the minimum and I want to network that spans the entire planet and so I'm  asking for an intergalactic one". And when they scale it down, we'll still get the  ... So that's where the internet came from. Literally. The original name of the internet  was the intergalactic computing, and nobody knew how to do it back then. Packet, packet  switching had not been invented in 63. And here's a nice line in that memo,  if we succeed in making an intergalactic then our main problem will be learning to  communicate with aliens and he meant this in the biggest possible way and I don't  have time to really explain it, it's really interesting. People who are interested should write  me an email. Didn't mean just other people, he meant other software. Other computers. He  meant, what does it mean to communicate when you scale things up? So this guy  was a big thinker. Number nine, you can't think inside the belt way. That's of  course referring to Washington DC, but this is a general principal. And they asked him  why and he said "well because there's too much noise, there's too much politics, there's  too much bullshit and nobody does research in Washington DC". So the last thing we  want to do as RPA funders is to try and think while we're there. Our  job is to get money out of the government and pass it along. So a  solution to that was say "Hey, let's not be here for longer than two years".  And so every two years Lick set up the process to get his successor, happened  that Ivan Sutherland got drafted into the army at just the right time. And so  they grabbed him. So at age 26 Ivan ran this whole show and man was  he good. So he was a second lieutenant, chairing meetings with generals and one of  the most famous things recalled of that, some generals going on and on at some  point Ivan said "General, you have just two minutes to make your point if you  have one". That's about the simplest way of describing Ivan. Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts,  those are the four that made this happen. Taylor is special because he also is  the guy who setup PARC. An he was a student of Lick Lyder. Lick Lyder  was intuitively wonderful. Taylor was a student of what was wonderful about Lick Lyder, he  could explain everything that Lick Lyder could do and why it worked. So here's a  couple of things I'm not going to go on about, but basically the idea here  is, it isn't like, let's look around and see what is available and what we  can do with it. The idea was, stick with the vision and just make every  frigging thing that's necessary. Doesn't matter what it is. If we have to make a  new kind of integrated circuit we'll do it. All of these things were done. So  it's very much like these other cultures where nobody worried about whether you had a  half centimeter radar in building 20 at MIT, they just did it. And here's one  that is really a bug today. And if you don't have the chops, yeah you  shouldn't make your tools. You shouldn't make your own operating system, you shouldn't make your  own programming language because that's not what you're trying to do. If you do have  the chops, and you better not do this unless you have the chops, then you  have to make your own hardware and software and operating system and programming languages. Otherwise,  you're working in the past on some vendor's bad idea of what computing is about.  So part of what Picasso said. You have to get really much much better than  most people want to today. And here's another reversal, today people buy hardware and put  software on it basically to make the hardware look good. The RPA community and PARC  did exactly the opposite, started off with the software, using super computers to simulate the  thing and when you got the software the way you wanted it, then you designed  a computer that would optimize and make more efficient what you're doing on a super  computer. That was what Sketch Pad was. Nobody thought that the next graphic systems were  going to be done on a computer the size of this building. Okay? And then  make a bunch of them. So almost every project in the RPA project, they actually  made enough of them so they could be used as tools. They weren't just demos.  And so part of this invention process had to require a kind of limited engineering,  PARC for instance had a thing where whatever you did, you had to make 100  of them. Made an ethernet, it had to run 100 machines. If you made a  time sharing system it had to run 100 users. If you made personal computer you  had to be able to build 100 of them. Learn how to argue. This is  what you learned as a graduate student there. Argue for clarity, not to win. It's  the biggest bug today. People are always contending with each other, trying to be winners  and losers, and that's one of the problems with Washington, they've forgotten what their job  is. No. What we have to do is understand the complicated things. Here's a big-ee,  every researcher at PARC was a second or third generation Phd that RPA had created.  Right? Eight years, so it wasn't just the stuff in the past. I'll show you  a couple more of those while we're getting close to ... But it was creating  the next generation. Again, this is baseball. Baseball you don't, you have to have form,  you have to develop talent going all the way down to little league. And they  did. And the other thing is a little difficult to ... Some of you will  understand this readily. That the reward of doing this stuff wasn't the reward of making  it happen, because a lot of times it didn't happen. It was the reward of  actually being funded to work on what the actual problems were. I can't emphasize this  too much. Working on what the problems actually are rather than something that's going to  get a paper, something that's going to make you money ... But taking big human  problems could be something like drinkable water for the 70% of the planet that doesn't  have it. Doesn't matter. There is no other goal. If you pick one of those  things that's a great one, worth putting a life into. Okay. So, background was partially  tinkering, a lot of people came from new york. Down where the World Trade Center  was. Before the World Trade Center there was about a mile across Manhattan island that  was nothing but electronic surplus stores. Mow a few lawns, put a dime into the  subway and you could go down there and buy almost anything to mess around with.  And that group got used to ... Everybody was broke. So, but you could build  your own ... Like there was a kit to build your own oscilloscope. And if  you wanted an oscilloscope and you were broke, you could get one of these on  time for 30 or 40 bucks and build it. And ... I'm going to just  put ... These are just washed out anyway, so I'm just going to go past.  Okay so Morris law, this is the original thing in Morris' paper, doubling every year,  he picked MOS silicon which is too slow to make things out of but we  get faster if you made it smaller, here's doubling every two years and what happened,  the prediction was 30 years and so what happened was very in line with doubling  every tow years to every eighteen months. And there is physics behind this, this wasn't  just an engineering aspiration. And so if you believe this, you had something really worthwhile.  I'm going to skip past Englebart here ... I think you should see a little  of this though. Cause at the same time the mouse was invented, this was done  at Rand and how did the Rand people go about it? Well, at midnight they  would go through people's waste paper baskets to see how they worked. What were they  throwing away? And people were .. What people were doing when they were working was  making all kinds of diagrams, little flow charts and all of this stuff, so they  said, okay well let's invent the first tablet ... Is good as most of the  tablets you've ever used today. The hallmark of these people is they generally did it  good enough and heres ...

Video : You start to edit the flow diagram. First we erase a then move the connector  all the way so that we may draw a box in its place. The printing  in the box is being used as commentary only in this case. The box is  slightly too large so we may change its size. Then draw a flow from the  connector to the box. Attach a decision element to the box and draw a flow  from it to scan. We then erase the flow ...

Allen K: Okay so this is about 1968 or so, big room sized main-frame with one guy.  But this system really, what you could ask your question more even about this, this  system was one of the best systems I've ever used and every ... It felt  so intimate, it was so different from the mouse. You know, I was one of  the things that we, that we actually looked at. I guess I do have to  show the next ... The next thing here. Just so you think that the VR  wasn't something done recently, but the second thing Ivan did after he came back, the  thing when he came back from RPA was to do this. I worked on this  when I was a graduate student. You could grab things, you had a thing in  your hand. Grab things and move them around and ... It's a little exciting because  instead of the thing that you used today in VR it had two CRTs with  1500 watts right about your ears crackling away. So that's a very exciting thing to  do, and of course one of hardest things was to do good head positioning back  then, there are many ways of doing ... One of the things they did here,  I won't explain what it is, but it was hooked to a crane. So as  you walked around this big room at MIT a crane would ... Follow ... Would  automatically follow you with the positioning thing over your head to find out what ...  what this was about. And oh man. I'm getting killed because I should stop right  now. But, I really have two more things to do. If you could give me  two more minutes I will ... First one here is, this is something you have  to think about. Let time go one way and progress go the other way. Yay,  boo, yay, boo. It goes up it goes down. This is the way that people  tend to measure things. Problem is, they never put in a threshold. Put in a  threshold then the only things above the threshold count, like these are reading scores, they  ... Nothing counts. Reading scores never get above threshold. So it doesn't matter whether they  go up or down. And what is actually needed changes over time. You need more  and if you're measuring to a baseline, which people usually do, one of the ways  of improving things or making it look like you're not doing such a bad job  is to lower the baseline. For example Apple completely lowered the baseline on what constitutes  reasonable user interface for Iphones and Ipads. Interfaces on the systems before hand had an  undo and these don't. And I can think of 15 more things. Think about it.  So what they did, is they decided, "Well we're just, we're just not going to  work on all of those problems anymore. We're going to condition the unsophisticated public to  do work at the level of a two year old or a 92 year old.  And we're just going to eliminate everything in between". And the public has bought it.  Because you don't want to count noses when you're looking for quality. People can be  talked into anything. So what you have to do on this stuff, is you have  to pick something that is absolutely above that line. We call that the Boot Mcrae  sweet spot. He's the guy who did man powered flight. And once you have achieved  that, it opens up a whole region that you can explore, and that's what we  did at PARC. A moonshot was set space travel back 50 years. Everybody uses this  metaphor "We need a moonshot". No we don't need a moonshot. You don't do space  travel with chemical rocketry. And what's interesting about the people who like ... Jeff Bezos  and yeah , they don't get it. MV equals MV. Every child who read science  fiction in the 50s knew this. What that means is, either have to carry a  shit load of reaction mass with you if you're doing chemicals because you can't get  the velocity high enough, so you have to out out a lot of mass and  if you do that, you have to lift that mass. So you wind up with  45 story building rockets just to get into orbit. That is nuts. Anyway, I will  not go on that ... So, but the thing that was a tragedy was that  there are very good proposals for how to get that high exhaust velocity using various  forms of atomic power and it was something that the public was not interested in.  The moonshot was not about space travel. Okay, so, I'll skip past this. Because I  want to end with, oh yeah here's the ... So this tablet computer I thought  up in 1968, it had two initial forms. One was the familiar tablet, and the  other was what Ivan's head display was inevitable with Morris law. And then Nicolas Nigriponie  had this idea of wearing a watch and communicating with the rest of the world.  Okay. So here's the last little segment and then I'll let you go. Wayne Gretzky,  you know who Wayne Gretzky is. I'll bet, famous hockey , and he was just  a little guy. He tried to avoid fights. They asked him why he took so  many shots on goal, he said, "Well you miss 100% of the shots you don't  take". So he wasn't trying to be careful. He scored more goals than anybody in  history by 1000. So, the fact that his percentage of misses was also high was  irrelevant. And they asked him why he was better than anybody else, and he said  "Well, a good hockey player goes to where the puck is, a bright one goes  to where the puck is going to be" and he didn't mean tracking the puck.  He meant getting into a place where somebody could pass him the puck where he  could make a goal. So what he did, was he looked at the entire configuration,  saw where the future was going to be and went to that place in the  ... So you can make a game to invent the future out of this. So,  you start off with cosmic goodness intuition, like for me the tablet one was good.  You identify a favorable exponential, like Morris law. You take the cosmic intuition out 30  years and you ask "Can we say, wouldn't it be ridiculous if we didn't have  this" and 30 years out, 30 years way, well of course we'll have one. That's  what that exponential means. And bring it back to the 10-15 year point, at that  point you can just pay money because that's also what Morris law and what Turing  means, is if you pay a lot of money now you can make the commodity  computer of 10-15 years in the future, that's what the Alto was. It was about  50 times faster than what you got out of time sharing terminal. And make a  bunch of them. And you intertwine it with the ... So run the software and  then you can do two kinds of computing in the future. One kind of computing  is zillions of experiments to get a user interface that would be universal for ...  right now 5 billion people, and deal with millions of people that you've never, who  are doing applications you've never seen before. And the other thing you can do, the  thing on the right there is Microsoft Word as it was at Xerox PARC in  1974, if you optimized the code, you could get what the applications are going to  be ten years out. So those are the two things you can do by doing  this super computer thing. And it costs money, in today's dollars those Altos cost about  125k a piece. And we made 2000 of them. Think about that. You've got to  be a funder who's serious, XEROX went batshit when we did it. They really went  batshit when we wanted to cash them in. I'll just leave you this, since I'm  over time now. I'll leave you this as ... One of the ways of escaping  the present, have glimmer of an idea, take it so far out that you don't  have to worry about how you're going to get there, and then you just bring  it back. So instead of innovating out from the present, what you want to do  is invent the future from the future. Go out and live in the future and  bring the future back. Thank you.
