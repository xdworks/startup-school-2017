# How to Get Users and Grow - Alex Schultz

Speaker 1: Good afternoon everybody. Today we have Alex Schultz, VP of growth at Facebook, and probably  the world expert on growth. As he can vouch from this weekend, the person I  go to when I have a really hard growth question. Many people who work at  Facebook, many of the founders of Facebook in fact, and very early employees have said  hiring Alex has been one of the secret successes of Facebook that is not well  understood. You joined in almost ten years ago and I think at that point Facebook  had less than 100 million users.

各位下午好。今天，Facebook的增长副总裁亚历克斯·舒尔茨(AlexSchultz)可能是世界经济增长专家。因为他可以担保从这个周末，我去找的人，当我有一个非常困难的成长问题。很多在Facebook工作的人，很多Facebook的创始人-事实上，还有早期的员工-都说雇佣Alex是Facebook的秘密成功之一，人们对此还不太了解。你是在近十年前加入的，我认为那时Facebook的用户还不到1亿。

Alex Schultz: Yeah.

亚历克斯·舒尔茨：是的。

Speaker 1: Way less than 100 million users. Facebook now has 1.6 billion, and Alex has been,  after the importance of having a great product, maybe the second most important driver of  that.

演讲者1：远远少于1亿用户。Facebook现在拥有16亿美元，亚历克斯在拥有一款伟大产品的重要性之后，可能是这方面的第二大驱动因素。

Alex Schultz: Havi, Naomi, those very important people.

亚历克斯·舒尔茨：哈维，娜奥米，那些非常重要的人。

Speaker 1: And the team. Anyway, thank you very much for coming to speak to us.

演讲者1：还有团队。不管怎么说，非常感谢你能来和我们说话。

Alex Schultz: Thank you.

亚历克斯·舒尔茨：谢谢。

I did not pay Sam for that introduction, and I would note that  Havi is my boss, so hi Havi. But no, Havi and Naomi, Danny, there are  these people who have been on the growth team for four years, and then there  are people like Blake and and Ray and James Wang who set the team up,  and it's very nice, but I am a VP on growth, I am not the  VP of growth. So you've had an amazing lecture series.

我没有付钱给山姆，我要指出的是，哈维是我的老板，所以哈维。但是不，哈维和内奥米，丹尼，有些人已经在成长队工作了四年，还有像布莱克、雷和王这样的人建立了这个团队，这很好，但是我是一个成长副总裁，我不是成长的副总裁。所以你做了一系列很棒的讲座。

I've just watched all of  them yesterday to make sure I didn't say anything without actually having seen what everybody  else said, and it was totally awesome.

我昨天刚刚看了所有的人，以确保我没有说任何东西，而没有真正看到其他人说的话，这是非常棒的。

I loved what D'Angelo had to say, so  that lecture if you weren't here, if you didn't watch it, I strongly recommend you  go back and see what Adam D'Angelo said, because I could not emphasize his points  on metrics more than enough. And so what I'm going to try and do for  the first half is go over some of the points that have been made already,  and emphasize what I think is most important when you're thinking about growth and what  my take is and our take is on the Facebook growth team on those, and  then in the second half try and talk to you a little bit more about  tactics that have been particularly useful. The caveat that I think you should take on  board is what Stuart from Slack and Flickr said, which is to some extent you  do have a 100 million monkeys bashing at typewriters. And I am very, very lucky  to be on the growth team at Facebook, to get to work on a product  like Facebook that has the retention that Facebook does, that has everyone in the world  wanting to use the product. And to say that, like, I drove it or any  of us drove it beyond there being great product market fit is perhaps not true.  I can't tell you what the AB test is if we didn't have a growth  team at Facebook. So what matters most to growth? The single most important thing to  growth is retention. Adam commented on this in his talk, and he showed you cohorts  from some real company. But here is a stylized cohort of how you should look  at retention. The number of days from acquisition is on the x axis, on the  y axis is the percent of people who are still monthly active.

我喜欢D‘Angelo必须说的话，所以如果你不在这里，如果你不看的话，我强烈建议你回去看看Adam D’Angelo说了什么，因为我不能过多地强调他的观点。所以，我要在上半场试着做的是，复习一些已经提出的要点，并强调我认为最重要的是什么，当你在考虑增长时，我的看法是什么，我们的观点是在Facebook的增长团队中，然后在下半部分试着和你谈一谈更多关于特别有用的战术。我认为你应该接受的警告是斯拉克和Flickr的斯图尔特说的，在某种程度上，你确实有一亿只猴子在打字机。我非常、非常幸运地加入了Facebook的增长团队，能够开发出像Facebook这样的产品，它拥有Facebook那样的优势，让世界上的每个人都想使用这个产品。要说，就像，我开的车，或者我们中的任何一个人开的车，都超越了产品市场的适合范围，这也许不是真的。如果我们没有Facebook的增长团队，我无法告诉你AB测试是什么。那么，增长最重要的是什么？增长最重要的一件事是保持不变。亚当在他的演讲中对此发表了评论，他向你展示了一些来自真正公司的团队成员。但这里有一个程式化的队列，你应该如何看待保留。从收购开始的天数是在x轴上，在y轴上是仍然每月活跃的人的百分比。

I care a  lot about using monthly active, not daily active, not weekly active. There are really good  arguments for using daily active that people say all the time, because it's about intensity  of usage, but what really, really matters is that you've got skin in the game  and people come back to your product at least once a month, and then you  build on top of that engagement, revenue, whatever your key metrics are, which we'll get  to in a minute. But firstly I believe monthly active is the most important thing.  The second thing is how do you really calculate it? So I've got a real  graph for revenue in a few slides from Facebook from the first 250 days of  our ads product which I'll show you. But I think what's really, really important is  to say that it's very easy to calculate this curve even if you have a  thousand or a hundred users. And what you do is you look at all of  your users on the first day after they signed up. Were they monthly active? Yes,  clearly. The first thirty days, everyone's going to be monthly active.

我非常关心每月的活动，不是每天的活动，不是每周的活动。人们一直在说，使用日常活动确实有很好的理由，因为这是关于使用强度的，但真正重要的是，你在游戏中表现得很好，人们每个月至少会回到你的产品上一次，然后你就会在你的参与、收入，不管你的关键指标是什么的基础上建立起来，我们马上就会讲到这一点。但首先，我认为每月活跃是最重要的事情。第二件事是你是如何计算的？因此，我从Facebook的几张幻灯片中得到了一张真实的收入图表，这些幻灯片来自我们广告产品的前250天，我将展示给大家看。但我认为真正非常重要的是，即使你有一千到一百个用户，也很容易计算出这条曲线。你所做的就是在你的所有用户注册后的第一天查看他们。他们每月都很活跃吗？是的，很明显。头30天，每个人都会每月都很活跃。

I'd prefer if you  defined a month as 28 days, by the way, 'cause multiples of seven is really,  really good for these kind of metrics, because of weeks. But for the first 30  days, everyone has been active on their first day, on their second day, on their  third day as a monthly active user whether they came back or not. And then  what you do is you look at day 31. And obviously only some of your  users will have been active for 31 days. Everyone who signed up a day ago  was not active for 31 days. So what percentage of them were active on day  31? What percentage of them were active on day 32? And as you go further  and further out in the number of days since registration, the number of people who  have been on your service that long declines. Which means that your metric is gonna  get noisier, right? As you get out to the far right hand side of that  curve. But that doesn't mean you can't get a handle of where things flatten out  very, very early on with very small numbers of users. The number one criticism people  give me when I talk about retention as a metric, or even when you look  at what Adam presented in his presentation earlier, is you need lots and lots of  users, so you need millions of users to calculate that. That is not true. We  did it with thousands of users in the early days of advertisers for Facebook for  example. Or, you need to have had all of those users on for a very  long time. Look at Adam's graph, it was multiple years with months, and months, and  months. No, you can do it day by day and you can get to a  really good place super, super fast using this methodology. So what are you looking for  in a retention curve? You're looking for it to flat line above zero, not flat  line like a heart monitor. You want it to flat line at some line that  asymptotes with the x axis. There are three types of these curves that I've seen.  The first type is where it asymptotes to the x axis, like really, really close,  goes down to almost zero. You hear about a lot of those companies, you think  about most games, right? Most games are smash hits. How many people use Farmville now  versus how many people used Farmville at its absolute, please tell me you know what  Farmville is. Yeah, okay. How many people use Farmville ...

我更希望你把一个月定义为28天，顺便说一句，因为7的倍数对于这类指标来说真的非常好，因为几个星期。但是在最初的30天里，每个人都在第一天、第二天、第三天作为一个每月活跃的用户活动，不管他们是否回来。然后你要做的就是看看第31天。而且很明显，只有一些用户已经活跃了31天。一天前报名的每个人在31天内都不活跃。那么，在第31天，他们中活跃的比例是多少呢？他们在第32天活跃的比例是多少？当你在注册后的天数越来越多的时候，在你的服务中长期服务的人数减少了。这意味着你的指标会变得更吵，对吧？当你走到那条曲线的最右边的时候。但是，这并不意味着你无法处理事情在非常、非常早的时候就在很小数量的用户中趋于平缓的情况。人们给我的第一条批评是，当我谈到保留度作为一种度量，甚至当你看亚当之前在他的报告中展示的时候，你需要大量的用户，所以你需要数以百万计的用户来计算这个数字。那不是真的。例如，在Facebook广告商的早期，我们就对成千上万的用户做了这件事。或者，您需要让所有这些用户都上很长一段时间。看看Adam的图表，它是几年，几个月。不，你可以一天地做这件事，你可以用这种方法达到一个非常好的地方-超级，超快。那么，在保留曲线中，你在寻找什么呢？你要找的是零度以上的直线，而不是心脏监视器那样的直线。你想让它在x轴渐近线上的平行线上。有三种类型的曲线，我见过。第一种类型是它渐近线到x轴，就像真的非常接近，下降到几乎为零。你听说过很多这样的公司，你会想到大多数的游戏，对吗？大多数游戏都是扣人心弦的。现在有多少人使用Farmville，多少人绝对使用Farmville，请告诉我，您知道Farmville是什么。是的，好的。有多少人使用Farmville.。

I'm feeling old, I had  hair when I first did one of these. How many people use Farmville now versus  how many people used to use it? Farmville was a smash hit. Then there's other  ones which look like this, where they stabilize out. So you think about Minecraft, right?  Or World of Warcraft. These games that somehow have network effects and people stay in  them for a long time. The other version of this curve I've seen is the  ones where they go down, they look like they're going to hit the x axis,  and then the reaccelerate and they go up. There's a few different things that can  cause that, right? So you have this overwhelming things that's driving you down to have  zero retention, and somehow the numbers go up again. So things that drive that for  businesses, and you actually I think mentioned this in your intro. One, network effects. So  when all your friends get on Facebook you're much more likely to use Facebook. When  all your friends get on Twitter, you're more likely to use Twitter, WhatsApp, Messenger, whichever  social service you're talking about. There are network effects that really matter. Network effects also  count in marketplaces. When you have enough sellers you can have enough buyers, when you  have enough traffic you get more sellers. And so as marketplaces go, often what you  find is these old cohorts that signed up resurrect and come back to the service.  So network effects can drive the curve up after it's flat lined somewhere, or it's  heading towards zero. The second thing that can do this is opening up a new  interface. So think about it, a lot of people do release their apps first on  iOS.

我老了，我第一次做这个的时候有头发。现在有多少人使用Farmville，而有多少人曾经使用过Farmville？FarmVille非常成功。还有其他看起来像这样的，它们在那里稳定下来。所以你想到了我的世界，对吧？或者魔兽世界。这些游戏在某种程度上具有网络效应，人们在其中停留了很长一段时间。我看到的这条曲线的另一个版本是，它们向下移动，它们看起来像会撞上x轴，然后再加速，然后上升。有几种不同的东西会导致这种情况，对吧？所以，你有这样的压倒性的东西，把你推到零保持，不知怎么的，数字又上升了。所以那些推动商业发展的东西，实际上我想你在你的介绍中提到了这一点。第一，网络效应。所以当你所有的朋友都上了Facebook，你就更有可能使用Facebook了。当你所有的朋友都上了Twitter，你更有可能使用Twitter，WhatsApp，Messenger，无论你在谈论什么社交服务。网络效应确实很重要。网络效应在市场中也很重要。当你有足够的卖家，你可以有足够的买家，当你有足够的流量，你得到更多的卖家。因此，随着市场的发展，你通常会发现，这些古老的群体，他们注册复活，然后回到服务中来。因此，网络效应可以推动曲线上升后，它是平行线的某处，或它正走向零。第二件可以做到的事情是打开一个新的接口。想想看，很多人都会先在iOS上发布他们的应用程序。

I actually loved Jan's talk last week for this, by the point that he  made of starting with Nokia, focusing on Android, because it's what most of the world  use. But in Silicon Valley, we typically build our apps first on iOS more often  than not. And then when someone releases a Android application, and this was something I  saw with Instagram years and years ago. But when you release an Android application, people  might have tried it on an iPhone and then traded their iPhone for an Android  and no longer be able to access your service. People might have tried your service  on a friend's iPhone, and then when you add Android they come back and use  your service. So that's another thing that can drive you up again. And then the  third thing that I've seen on these curves that drive these curves up again is  adding categories. So think about Amazon. There was a really good discussion, was that Stuart  earlier or ... Someone earlier in this talked about Amazon and how Amazon started with  books. Because there was this large inventory available of books. But then they added in  another category, and then they added in another category over time. And imagine, there'll be  people who came to Amazon to buy that one book, but then two years down  the line Amazon suddenly had kitchen ware, I don't know, or fashion. And they came  back and then they bought fashion, and it brought them more use cases to come  back more monthly active. This was true with eBay, we added motors.

我很喜欢简上周的演讲，因为他从诺基亚开始，专注于Android，因为这是世界上大多数人使用的东西。但在硅谷，我们通常会先在iOS上构建应用程序。后来有人发布了Android应用程序，这是我多年前在Instagram上看到的。但是当你发布Android应用程序时，人们可能已经在iPhone上尝试过，然后用iPhone换了Android，不再能够访问您的服务。人们可能在朋友的iPhone上尝试过你的服务，然后当你添加Android时，他们会回来使用你的服务。所以这是另一件能让你重新振作起来的事情。然后，我在这些曲线上看到的第三件事，把这些曲线再次向上推高，就是增加类别。所以想想亚马逊。有一个很好的讨论，是史都华早些时候还是.早些时候有人谈到了亚马逊和亚马逊是如何从书籍开始的。因为有大量的图书可供使用。但随着时间的推移，他们加入了另一个类别，然后又加入了另一个类别。想象一下，会有人来亚马逊买那一本书，但两年后亚马逊突然拥有了厨房用具，我不知道，也不知道时尚。然后他们回来了，然后他们买了时尚，这给他们带来了更多的用例，让他们每月都更活跃。易趣就是这样，我们增加了马达。

I remember being  at eBay and we had to do all of our reporting on gross merchandise volume  with and without motors, and no one had ever believed that you could buy a  car online. And eBay did it, and it created a whole new use case for  people, many of whom were existing eBay customers who now had one more category they  could shop in. So, you want a curve that asymptotes to a line parallel to  the x axis. You can do it with far more limited amounts of data than  most people think you can by using the technique I outlined earlier, and I'll show  you a real world example in a few slides. And there are three types of  curves that I've seen. Curves that asymptote like this, awesome. Your company will survive. How  big will it get, we have another question. Curves that go straight to zero, that's  okay. You could be in games and your job is to produce one hit after  another after another. EA doesn't expect whatever, FIFA 2012 to still have lots of users  now if they've released FIFA 27. So it's okay, there are businesses where hitting the  x axis is okay, but you need to know you're in one of those businesses.  And then the third that I've seen is the curve going up, and that can  be driven by network effects, that can be driven by being available on more platforms,  that can be driven by adding categories to your marketplace or service. From this falls  out a brilliant way to look at growth, and this guy Danny Ferante who was  at Yahoo, who was one of the first members of the growth team, runs core  data science at Facebook, he's totally awesome, he's really the brains behind the operation and  the mouth. Danny brought this to Facebook, and it's a simple way to look at  growth. We were looking at growth as how many users were we growing by, week  on week. We looked at it at an absolute basis. And looking at it like  that, we were like, "Huh, so we're signing up whatever it was, a million a  week, and we're growing by whatever it was, 800,000 a week, I don't know." Cool,  we're churning 200,000 people. And we never actually looked at it in this way. When  we changed the way we look at things to say, "Okay, the net growth is  800,000 a week. The new users are one million a week. But what is churn  and resurrection?" And what we actually found at the time, and I can't remember the  absolute numbers so I'll just make some up, but imagine you're churning 1.3 million. So  not 200,000, 1.3 million. You're resurrection 1.1 million. So, plus 1, minus 1.3, plus 1.1,  you've got net 800,000 in growth, but that 800,000 growth is being driven, I think  I did the math wrong, that 800,000 in growth is being driven by a different  order of magnitude from churn and resurrection than you realized. And so that helps you  focus on how do I stop people churning? How do I get people to come  back to my service who are not coming back to my service right now? So  once you have your retention curves, and once you start to have a business with  retention, you need to look at your growth accounting, not just how many users are  we acquiring. Make sense? Overall the number one thing I focus on for growth, the  number one thing we focus on for growth, is retention. So what gets you retained  in any given service? Magic moment. What is the moment when you used AirBnB? What  is the moment when you used DoorDash, when you used Slack, when you used Facebook,  LinkedIn, WhatsApp? Whatever the product, what is that moment when you went, "Yes.

我记得在易趣，我们必须做所有的报告，我们的商品总量，无论有没有马达，没有人曾经相信，你可以在网上购买汽车。eBay做到了这一点，它为人们创造了一个全新的用例，其中许多人都是易趣的现有客户，他们现在有了更多的商品类别。所以，你需要一条曲线，渐近线到与x轴平行的一条线。通过使用我前面描述的技术，您可以使用比大多数人认为的更有限的数据来完成这一任务，我将在几张幻灯片中向您展示一个真实世界的示例。我见过三种类型的曲线。像这样渐变的曲线，太棒了。你的公司会活下来的。它会有多大，我们还有一个问题。曲线直接变为零，没关系。你可以在游戏中，你的工作是创造一个又一个的热门。EA并没有预料到什么，如果国际足联2012年发布了国际足联27版，他们现在仍将拥有大量的用户。所以没关系，有些商业，在x轴上是可以的，但是你需要知道你在其中一项业务中。然后，我看到的第三条曲线正在上升，它可以由网络效应驱动，可以通过在更多平台上可用来驱动，也可以通过在市场或服务中添加类别来驱动。从这个角度看增长，这个人是雅虎的丹尼·费兰特，他是增长团队的第一批成员之一，他在Facebook经营核心数据科学，他非常棒，他是运营和嘴巴的幕后操纵者。丹尼把这个带到了Facebook，这是一个简单的看待增长的方法。我们关注的是用户数量的增长，我们每周都在增长。我们从绝对的角度看了它。看着它，我们会说，“嗯，我们每周签下了一百万份，每周有八十万份，我不知道。”太好了，我们有20万人。我们从来没有这样看待过它。当我们改变看待事物的方式时，我们会说：“好吧，每周净增长80万人。新用户是每周100万人。但什么是搅动和复苏呢？”我们当时发现了什么，我记不起绝对数字了，所以我会编一些，但想象一下你的数据是130万。所以不是20万，130万。你要复活110万。所以，加上1，减去1.3，再加上1.1，你得到了净80万的增长，但是80万的增长被驱动，我想我做错了数学，80万的增长是由一个与你意识到的不同的数量级驱动的。所以这能帮助你专注于我如何阻止人们翻身？我怎样才能让那些现在不回来为我服务的人回来服务呢？因此，一旦你有了你的保留曲线，一旦你开始与保留做生意，你就需要看看你的成长性核算，而不仅仅是我们收购了多少用户。讲得通总的来说，我关注增长的第一件事，我们关注增长的第一件事，就是保持不变。那么，在任何给定的服务中，您会保留什么呢？神奇时刻。你用Airbnb是什么时候？你使用DoorDash、Sack、Facebook、LinkedIn、WhatsApp是什么时候？不管是什么产品，你去的那一刻是什么时候，“是的。

I've got  it." On Facebook it's friends. You see that first friend, that person who, I've got  completely the wrong crowd for this, the person from high school who you lost contact  with as you grow older and moved away. But you see that person and you  go, "Wow, I haven't talked to them in years. Let's see what's going on with  their life." And they've had a kid and lost their hair too and you feel  better about yourself. That is a magic moment on Facebook. So how quickly can you  drive the user to that magic moment? You look at AirBnB, right? They've talked about  the delight that they give people, they've talked about these different screenshots of the stages  in the user journey that they created as a map of the user journey. Getting  that first person reserve your house, staying at that first property, those are our magic  moments. Ebay, buying your first item from a stranger online. Nowadays that doesn't seem crazy,  but back when I was working at eBay in the UK that was revolutionary, and  people really, their eyes lit up when you talked to them about it.

我明白了。“在Facebook上，这是朋友。你看到的是第一个朋友，那个人，我找错人了，高中来的那个人，随着年龄的增长，你和他失去了联系。但是你看到那个人，你就会说：”哇，我已经好几年没和他们说话了。让我们看看他们的生活是怎么回事。“他们生了个孩子，头发也掉了，你对自己感觉好多了。这在Facebook上是个神奇的时刻。那么，你能以多快的速度把用户带到那个神奇的时刻呢？你看Airbnb对吧？他们谈到了他们给人们带来的快乐，他们还谈到了他们创建的用户旅程的不同阶段的截图，它们是作为用户旅程的地图创建的。让第一个人预订你的房子，住在第一处房产，这是我们神奇的时刻。易趣，从一个陌生人网上购买你的第一件物品。如今，这似乎并不疯狂，但当我在英国的eBay工作时，这是革命性的，当你和人们谈论这件事时，他们的眼睛都亮了起来。

In Germany  they had this great ad , that showed the buildup of when you were waiting  for the auction to finish and for you to make your first purchase, and that  was such an adrenaline, endorphin moment, you know? That users loved it. Nowadays it seems  a long time ago, but those magic moments are what you need to look for.  So how do you find them? Well you can find them in the non scalable  way, which is, don't they all just sound relatively obvious? You can actually think through,  what is the experience of my product, what do I want people to do? You  can ask your first users, "Okay, you're keeping using my product, why are you keeping  using my product? What is the thing that makes you happy to use my product?  What was that first moment?" It's non scalable, but it generally works. When you ask  people, "What is the best thing about Facebook?" The first thing they say is, "Connecting  with friends and family." In all the research, "Why do you like Facebook?" "Oh, it  helps me connect with my friends and family." So you can do it the non  scalable way, or you can do it the scalable way. Look for correlations. So, Mark  has talked at startup school himself, and he said that we focused on getting people  to ten friends in fourteen days.

在德国，他们有一个很棒的广告，它展示了你等待拍卖结束和你第一次购买的时候的积累，那是一个肾上腺素，内啡肽的时刻，你知道吗？用户喜欢它。现在似乎是很久以前的事了，但是那些神奇的时刻是你需要去寻找的。你怎么找到他们的？你可以用不可伸缩的方式找到它们，也就是说，它们听起来不都是比较明显的吗？你真的可以想清楚，我的产品的经验是什么，我想让人们做什么？你可以问你的第一批用户，“好吧，你一直在使用我的产品，为什么还要继续使用我的产品呢？是什么让你乐于使用我的产品呢？第一时间是什么？”它是不可伸缩的，但通常可以工作。当你问人们，“Facebook最好的地方是什么？”他们说的第一件事是“和朋友和家人联系”。在所有的研究中，“你为什么喜欢Facebook？”“哦，这能帮助我和我的朋友和家人建立联系。”所以你可以用不可伸缩的方式来做，也可以用可伸缩的方式去做。寻找相关性。所以，马克自己在创业学校谈过，他说我们专注于在十四天内让人们认识十个朋友。

It's a smooth curve, right? Number of friends on  the x axis and percent retained on the y axis, it's not like there's a  step change at ten, if you get nine you don't retain, if you get eleven  you do and it all changes at ten. No, it's clearly a smooth curve, and  we picked a point on the curve. But there's a strong correlation between number of  friends you've got in the first fourteen days and whether you retain or not. There's  a correlation between number of friends in the first day, but there are correlations for  any product. Like, did you place a bid, did you do a buy it now,  or did you list an item on eBay, was the thing that was completely correlated  with retention for eBay. You can imagine, I don't know, I mean DoorDash was founded  at Stanford, right? You can imagine for DoorDash, you've placed your first order and that  order arrives to your door. And whether you've placed an order or not, how many  orders you've place in the first week, probably they are actually correlated with whether you  retain or not. So you need to look for the magic moment of your product  by talking to users, and then try and validate that with correlations. Make sense? Cool.  I love this, I put it in every presentation I do. So I'm lucky enough  to have been trained in physics at Cambridge in the UK, and my favorite lecture  series, not my favorite lecture but my favorite lecture series was this thing called Dimensional  Reasoning. And so it's easy for me to stand up here and say, "Okay, so  you need to get flat retention and then you have a viable business." That's not  actually true. That's kind of a glib statement.

这是一条平滑的曲线，对吧？x轴上的朋友数和y轴上保持的百分比，这不像在10点上有步骤变化，如果你得到9次，你没有保留，如果你得到11次，所有的变化都在10次。不，这显然是一条平滑的曲线，我们在曲线上选择了一个点。但是，在前十四天里你有多少朋友和你是否还在一起，这两者之间有着很强的相关性。在第一天，朋友的数量是相关的，但是对于任何产品来说都是相关的。比如，你出价了，你现在买了它，或者你在eBay上列出了一个项目，这与eBay的保留是完全相关的。你可以想象，我不知道，我是说DoorDash是在斯坦福创立的，对吧？你可以想象，对于DoorDash来说，你已经下了第一份订单，订单到达了你的门口。不管你是否下过订单，你在第一周下了多少订单，它们可能实际上都与你是否保留了订单有关。因此，您需要通过与用户交谈来寻找产品的神奇时刻，然后尝试使用相关性来验证这一点。讲得通凉爽的我喜欢这个，我把它写在我做的每一个报告里。所以我很幸运，在英国剑桥大学接受了物理培训，我最喜欢的系列讲座，不是我最喜欢的讲座，但我最喜欢的系列讲座是这个叫做维度推理的东西。所以我很容易站在这里说，“好吧，所以你需要保持平直，然后你就有了一个可行的生意。”其实不是这样的。这是一种轻描淡写的说法。

If you're producing a social network and  you have five percent retention, you're not going to long term have a tremendous social  network. Or a messaging app, like what use would WhatsApp be if only five percent  of your friends actually used WhatsApp who signed up for it? I mean, it'd be  useless, right? And there's no way we could release one billion plus numbers of active  users if that was true for us. On the other hand, if you have a  marketplace that is selling fashion, and you have five or ten percent retention, but those  people spend a lot of money, you have a totally viable business. And so the  level of retention you need varies dramatically by the category that you're in. Obviously the  higher the better is true in everything, like if you can have an eBay type  business model or Amazon type business model with 90 percent retention, you'll probably end up  bigger than Amazon.

如果你正在创建一个社交网络，并且你有5%的保留率，那么你不会长期拥有一个巨大的社交网络。或者是一款即时通讯应用，比如，如果你的朋友中只有5%的朋友真正使用了注册WhatsApp的WhatsApp，那么WhatsApp会有什么用呢？我是说，那是没用的，对吧？如果这对我们来说是正确的话，我们不可能释放10亿多个活跃用户。另一方面，如果你有一个销售时尚的市场，而且你有5%或10%的保留率，但是这些人花了很多钱，你有一个完全可行的生意。因此，你所需要的保留程度因你所处的类别而有很大的差异。显然，任何事情都越好，比如如果你可以拥有eBay类型的商业模式或者90%保留率的Amazon类型的商业模式，那么你最终可能会比Amazon更大。

I mean that would be incredible. But I think the point I  like to make is, you can figure it out. And I love this as an  inspirational story. So Jeffery Taylor was this British physicist, he was on the edge of  the Manhattan Project, he wasn't in the core. He ended up winning a Nobel Prize  later for a different area. And the US and Russian governments were releasing these images  to say, "This is how big our bomb is." But they weren't releasing the actual  power because that was a closely guarded state secret. And so what Jeffery Taylor did  is he used this technique called Dimensional Reasoning, where you look at the units in  the metric you are trying to achieve, so joules, right, for energy is joules. Kilograms  time meters squared over seconds squared, that's what joules decomposes into.

我是说那太不可思议了。但我想说的是，你可以搞清楚的。我喜欢这个鼓舞人心的故事。杰弗里·泰勒是一位英国物理学家，他在曼哈顿项目的边缘，他不在核心。后来，他因不同的领域而获得诺贝尔奖。美国和俄罗斯政府发布了这些图片，说：“这就是我们的炸弹有多大。”但他们并没有释放真正的权力，因为这是一个严密保密的国家机密。所以Jeffery Taylor所做的就是他使用了一种叫做维度推理的技术，在这里，你可以看到你试图达到的度量单位，所以焦耳，对，因为能量是焦耳。公斤计时器的平方是秒的平方，这就是焦耳分解成的。

In this case, kilograms,  what are you gonna use, the volume of the air times the density of the  air which handily is one, so you've now got meters cubed times meters squared over  seconds squared. So meters to the five time seconds to the minus two. The time  is on here, the diameter, the radius of the sphere is on here, you just  plug the radius in as m, you plug the diameter, the time in as seconds,  and you end up getting 25 kilotons as the output. You get ten to the  fourteen I think is what it works out as. And it turns out the bomb  was 21 kilotons as measured by the US governments. He could take one photo and  figure out the most closely guarded state secret in the United States at the time.  You can figure out what retention you need to have if he can figure that  out. So here's what I promised, this is an actual curve, I presented it at  a few different events, so I've taken off the numbers because I'm worried they're state  secrets. But this is from 2007 to 2008.

在这个例子中，公斤，你要用什么，空气的体积乘以空气的密度，而空气密度是1，所以你现在得到了米的立方乘以米的平方乘以秒的平方。所以米等于5秒到负2。时间在这里，直径，球体的半径在这里，你只要把半径插入，把直径，时间作为秒，最后得到25千吨的输出。你得到十比十四，我想结果就是这样。据美国政府测算，这枚炸弹的重量为21千吨。他可以拍一张照片，找出当时美国戒备森严的国家机密。如果他能弄清楚你需要保留什么。这是我承诺的，这是一个实际的曲线，我在几个不同的活动上展示了它，所以我摘掉了这些数字，因为我担心它们是国家机密。但这是从2007年到2008年。

I joined the week we started our  ads business at Facebook, our self service ad business by us. The pink speaks to  the right hand axis, the blue speaks to the left hand axis. What the blue  is, is how many advertisers had been in the system at least one day, two  days, three days, 'cause the x axis is number of days from acquisition, makes sense.  So the thing has only been around 250 days, so zero people had been advertisers  251 days ago, and on the 251st day. And all the people have been active  at least on day zero. And then each of those pink data points is the  total revenue we achieved from every user who had registered, who was using the service  on their 30th day or their 31st day, divided by how many users signed up  30 or 31 days ago. Not how many were active, right? How many signed up.  So total in the cohort who signed up 30 or 31 days ago, you divide  the revenue they made in a day by that number of users. And that gives  you that shape of curve that's up there.

我加入了我们在Facebook开展广告业务的那周，我们的自助服务广告业务。粉红色代表右手轴，蓝色代表左手轴。蓝色是多少广告商在系统中至少有一天，两天，三天，因为x轴是从收购开始的天数，这是有道理的。所以事情发生的时间只有250天，所以251天前没有人成为广告商，251天是第251天。所有的人至少在第0天都很活跃。然后，每个粉色数据点都是我们从注册用户那里获得的总收入，他们在第30天或第31天使用这项服务，除以30或31天前注册的用户数量。不是有多少人活跃，对吧？有多少人报名了。所以，在30或31天前注册的团队中，你可以将他们一天的收入除以这个用户数。这就给出了曲线的形状，就在上面。

I stumbled over my words a bit  there, I promise you if you look over it again it makes perfect sense.

我对我的话有点犹豫，我向你保证，如果你再看一遍，这是完全合理的。

I  did this with Danny back in 2008. The really important things I want you to  take away from looking a this curve is, look how flat the pink line is.  Like, I've been talking about curves flattening out, this is an actual curve flattening out.  And look how quickly it's flattened out. By 100 days you can pretty much predict  what the line is going to be at 200 days.

我在2008年和丹尼做过这件事。真正重要的是，我希望你不要看这条曲线，看看这条粉红色的线有多平。就像，我一直在说曲线变平，这是一个实际的曲线平坦。看看它被压扁得有多快。到了100天，你就可以很好地预测到200天这条线会是什么样子。

I've seen this over and  over, I've seen this with engagement. So if you divide time spent by the same  denominator, I've seen it actually for sentiment.

我一遍又一遍地看到这件事，我在订婚的时候看到过这件事。所以，如果你用相同的分母来除以时间，我看到它实际上是为了表达感情。

If you have a large enough sentiment survey,  and you divide it by that same denominator.

如果你有一个足够大的情绪调查，你除以相同的分母。

I have seen it for posts.

我看过这篇文章。

I  have seen it for photos uploaded, messages sent. Like, you can use the same techniques  that I talked about for determining how much retention you have and whether your business  is viable, to figure out what is the lifetime value of one of your customers.  If I was to acquire the total addressable market for my business today, what revenue  will I be making in 100 days? That's what this curve allows you to do.  You can predict it for posts, you can predict it for page views, time spent,  whatever you want. The same methodology works for engagement that works for retention. And actually  retention's often the biggest driver of this metric. And we did this with very little  data. Later on there's a stat we are okay releasing, which was end of 2012  we had about 700,000 active advertisers, beginning we had about 300,000 active advertisers. And this  was five years before that, so you can imagine there was a very small data  set that was behind calculating this. The last thing is I said things get noisy  the further out you go. You can literally see that on this graph, right? The  variance in the numbers the further to the right you go on the graph. So,  how do you operate for growth? Most important thing is have a clear goal. Brian  who is awesome on growth marketing at Facebook, great guy, he always says, "If you  are a growth team your product is a number." One of the most brilliant things  I think that Mark did in the early days of Facebook was he aligned the  entire company on monthly active people as our goal. Now, why does this matter? It  matters for a bunch of reasons. But the biggest and most important reason is I  think it aligns everyone. When you have a company of more than two or three  people, by the way a team of more than two or three people, certainly when  it gets to the hundreds, you can't control what anyone does.

我看过它上传的照片，发送的信息。例如，您可以使用与我所讲的相同的技术来确定您有多少保留，以及您的业务是否可行，以确定您的客户的终身价值。如果我今天要为我的业务获得可寻址的市场，我将在100天内获得什么收入？这就是这个曲线允许你做的。你可以预测它的文章，你可以预测它的页面浏览量，花费的时间，无论你想要什么。同样的方法适用于聘用，也适用于保留。而实际上，保留量往往是这个指标最大的驱动力。我们用很少的数据做了这件事。后来我们发布了一个统计数据，2012年底我们有大约70万活跃的广告商，开始我们有大约30万活跃的广告商。这是五年前的事了，所以你可以想象有一个非常小的数据集是用来计算这个的。最后一件事是我说你走得越远，事情就越吵。你可以在这张图上看到，对吧？数字的方差越远，在图上的右边就越远。那么，你是如何为增长而运作的呢？最重要的是要有一个明确的目标。布赖恩在Facebook的成长营销方面非常出色，他总是说：“如果你是一个成长团队，你的产品就是一个数字。”我认为马克在Facebook早期所做的最出色的事情之一就是，他把整个公司的目标都放在了每月活跃的人身上。那这又有什么关系呢？这很重要有很多原因。但最大和最重要的原因是我认为它使每个人一致。当你有一个超过两三人的公司，顺便说一句，一个两三个以上的团队，当然，当它到达数百人的时候，你无法控制任何人的行为。

I mean, you could  probably control what one person does, but the the other 199 would do whatever the  hell they wanted. So what do you want to do? You want to make sure  everyone is pointing in the same direction and that direction is generally right. So let's  think back to the early days of any company, whether it's Facebook, whether it's AirBnB,  LinkedIn, whatever you want to look at.

我的意思是，你也许可以控制一个人做什么，但其他199人会做他们想做的任何事情。那你想做什么？你要确保每个人都指向同一个方向，而且这个方向通常是正确的。所以让我们回想一下任何公司的早期，不管是Facebook，还是Airbnb，LinkedIn，无论你想看什么。

It would be completely reasonable to have a  goal of revenue. Right? You want your company to stay alive, you want to make  enough money that your company can still be viable, that you can employ people, that  the valuation goes up. So a reasonable person could say, "I think we need to  drive towards revenue." At the same time you could have a metric that was like,  if you're AirBnB, number of hosts.

有一个收入目标是完全合理的。对吗？你想让你的公司继续生存下去，你想赚到足够的钱，你的公司仍然可以生存，你可以雇佣员工，这样你的估值就会上升。所以一个通情达理的人可以说，“我认为我们需要争取收入。”同时，您可以有一个度量，如果您是Airbnb，那么主机的数量。

If you're Facebook, number of posts.

如果你是脸书的话，发几个帖子。

If you're DoorDash,  number of orders.

如果你是DoorDash，订单数量。

I don't even know what these companies' metrics are beyond Facebook's. You  could easily have a production metric or a consumption metric. You could have a time  spent in our service metric, and every one of those metrics would be a completely  reasonable metric to drive for. So, you've got ten reasonable people. Maybe five of them  think you should have monthly active people, one is really focused on revenue, two are  looking at time spent, and two are looking at number of posts. Everyone is pushing  in a reasonable direction that is vaguely aligned, but probably will have conflict.

我甚至不知道这些公司的指标超出了Facebook的标准。您可以很容易地拥有生产度量或消费度量。您可以在我们的服务度量中花费一段时间，而这些度量中的每一个都将是一个完全合理的指标。你有十个通情达理的人。也许他们中的五人认为你应该有一个月活跃的人，一个是真正关注收入的人，两个是看花的时间，两个是看帖子的数量。每个人都在朝着一个模糊一致的合理方向前进，但很可能会有冲突。

If you  want to get an ad in front of the user as quickly as you possibly  can, you may not necessarily want to put friends in front of them immediately.

如果你想尽可能快地在用户面前得到一个广告，你可能不一定要立即把朋友放在他们面前。

If  you want to get them to post, you may dial up the composer and push  down the ads.

如果你想让他们发帖，你可以拨打作曲家的电话，然后按下广告。

I don't know, like these are trade offs that you could be  making. And if the whole team isn't clear what the goal is they will be  in conflict. So having a clear goal that your company looks to drive is really,  really important, and having that goal be MAP in my opinion, is the best metric  that you can drive for because it is that once a month visitation that base  level you can drive off of if you're going to do a consumer internet company.  But fundamentally the most important thing is pick a goal, your team's product is a  goal, focus on that goal, align the company around that goal, and then you are  going to operate correctly for growth. The other thing I always say is you don't  need a growth team.

我不知道，就像这是你可以做的取舍。如果整个团队不清楚目标是什么，他们就会发生冲突。因此，你的公司想要实现一个明确的目标是非常重要的，在我看来，拥有这个目标是你可以追求的最好的指标，因为如果你打算去一家消费互联网公司的话，每个月访问一次这个基本水平。但从根本上说，最重要的是选择一个目标，你的团队的产品就是一个目标，专注于这个目标，使公司围绕着这个目标而一致，然后你将正确地运作以求成长。我常说的另一件事是你不需要一个成长团队。

If you are like a small company, if you're ever series  A, don't have a growth team, don't hire someone like me. The whole company's job  should be growth.

如果你是一个小公司，如果你曾经是A系列，没有一个成长团队，不要雇用像我这样的人。整个公司的工作应该是成长。

I'm very happy at Facebook so I don't want a job offer.  But the whole company's goal should be growing. The purpose of a startup is to  grow. So what is the number you want to grow, and align the whole company  against growing that number. Does that make sense? Now Naomi is amazing, and Naomi is  someone people don't know that well out of Facebook, but she runs product and engineering  for growth, she's brilliant. She's been at Facebook 12 years, so when you say I'm  original, I feel not original every day. She sits like three feet from me, she's  amazing. Anyway, she has this approach that we use to iterate through our growth planning  cycles, which I think works really well. Understand. First of all, understand what is going  on. Look at all the data you have. Talk to your users. Ask your users  what they think. Understand everything that is going on with your product that you can  possibly understand. What matters. Retention, are you churning too many? Do you have the retention?  Is the revenue going up on a per user basis? What are the acquisition channels  you're getting? Which channel are people resurrecting through? Are they resurrecting through email, is it  push notifications? What's going on? Understand what's going on for your system. Have that all  tracked. Then identify. Look through all of those different metrics, all of that different research  you get in, and identify where are there opportunities? Where do you see big drop  offs? Do you have a lot of people with push notifications turned on who are  not receiving push notifications? Do you have a lot of people who are receiving push  notifications who are not clicking on them? Do you have loads and loads of social  media traffic but no search traffic? Are your email viral invites working but your SMS  ones not, and what is the difference between those? Like, go and look at the  data and identify where there are gaps, and then try and double down on fixing  those gaps in the execution phase. To this day this is still how we run  growth at Facebook, and you can even see a talk Naomi and I gave online  nine years ago I think at F8. Eight or nine years ago, where we talk  about using this approach, and we have kept it going. Understand what's going on, identify  the opportunities in that data you've understood, and then execute against it. Another really interesting  thing I think was said earlier is, "Data debt sucks, and you're going to regret  it later, and your intuition is going to run out at some point and then  you're going to want data." In 2009 we actually shut down all of the work  the growth team was doing during January and we only spent the time logging and  making sure every critical flow on Facebook, registration. At the time we didn't log clicks  on emails, so clicks on emails.

我在Facebook非常高兴，所以我不想要工作机会。但整个公司的目标应该是增长。创业的目的是为了成长。那么，你想要增长的数字是多少，并将整个公司与这个数字的增长联系起来。这有道理吗？现在内奥米很棒，内奥米是一个人们对Facebook不太了解的人，但是她经营着产品和工程来促进增长，她很聪明。她在Facebook工作了12年，所以当你说我很有创意时，我并不是每天都觉得自己很有创意。她就坐在离我三英尺远的地方，她太棒了。不管怎么说，她有这样的方法，我们用它来迭代我们的增长计划周期，我认为这个方法效果很好。明白。首先，了解发生了什么。看看你所有的数据。和你的用户谈谈。问问你的用户他们是怎么想的。了解您的产品所发生的一切，您可能理解。重要的是。留着，你搅动太多了吗？你留着吗？每个用户的收入是否都在增加？你有哪些收购渠道？人们通过哪个频道复活？他们是通过电子邮件复活的，是推送通知吗？到底怎么回事?了解你的系统发生了什么。都追踪到了。那就认出来。看看所有这些不同的指标，所有不同的研究，找出哪里有机会？你在哪里看到大的下降？你有很多有推送通知的人没有收到推送通知吗？你有很多没有点击推送通知的人吗？你是否有大量的社交媒体流量，但没有搜索流量？你的电子邮件病毒邀请工作，但你的短信不工作，两者有什么区别？比如，查看数据，找出存在差距的地方，然后尝试在执行阶段修复这些空白。直到今天，这仍然是我们在Facebook的增长方式，你甚至可以看到我和娜奥米九年前在网上发表的一篇演讲，我认为是在F8。八、九年前，我们讨论过使用这种方法，我们一直在这样做。了解正在发生的事情，找出你所理解的数据中的机会，然后针对它执行。我之前说过的另一件非常有趣的事情是，“数据债务太糟糕了，你以后会后悔的，你的直觉在某个时候会耗尽，然后你会想要数据。”2009年，我们实际上关闭了增长团队在1月份所做的所有工作，我们只花了时间记录并确保Facebook上的每一个关键流程，注册。当时我们没有记录对电子邮件的点击，所以点击电子邮件。

It seems obvious now, but we didn't have it.  Clicks on emails, did you then actually log in or did you fail in the  password entry, all of these different things, we logged them so that we could understand  what was going on, and that was super critical 'cause actually in March that year  we had a massive growth slow down, and we would not have been able to  understand what was going on if we hadn't done the logging in January, because what  went on was actually super nuanced. And without that logging in place we wouldn't have  known. Get the data logged so you can run through this process. So speaking of  data, I am very, very lucky at Facebook, I do growth marketing, I run the  awesome internationalization team, but I also run the analytics team for the company and that's  been a couple of years now. When I talk about data to people internally, I  like to say these three points. There's a meme in the valley that you operate  either for user experience or for metrics. And I really want to bust that meme.  Data, when used in the right way, gives you empathy about your users. One example  I've talked about in the past is we launched a product on Facebook that you  may have seen on your big 42 inch monitors, no one has a big 42  inch monitor in here, but I'm sure some of you do at home. That has  on the right hand side, all the friends you could chat with on Facebook, but  at the top it has this list of stories that's ticking over called ticker. When  you're on a small screen, that product used to collapse into the right hand column  of Facebook and push things down so that you could still see these stories ticking  over. That product worked great for all of us who had huge numbers of friends,  who were creating a lot of content on big screens. But if you went to  the Philippines, where there was huge usage in internet cafes, and people were on narrow  screens, the majority of them ended up having that in the right hand column, and  the majority of them were low engagement with Facebook and couldn't see people you may  know below the fold. And so we actually lost friending amongst users who are very  different to ourselves, and we only figured out what was happening by looking at the  data and saying, "Ah, why is this bad on small screens and awesome on big  screens? Why is it not so great for low engagement users and super for power  users?" It was because we used the data to understand these users who were different  to us here in Silicon Valley. Now think about it.

现在看来很明显，但我们没有。点击电子邮件，然后你真的登录，或者你在密码输入上失败了，所有这些不同的事情，我们记录它们，以便我们能够了解发生了什么，这是非常关键的，因为实际上，在那一年的三月，我们有一个巨大的增长缓慢，我们将无法了解发生了什么，如果我们没有在一月份进行伐木，因为发生的事情实际上是非常微妙的。如果没有那个伐木，我们就不会知道。获取记录的数据，以便可以运行此过程。所以说到数据，我在Facebook非常幸运，我从事增长营销，我经营着一个令人敬畏的国际化团队，但我也为公司管理着分析团队，这已经过去了几年。当我向内部的人谈论数据时，我喜欢说这三点。在山谷中有一个模因，您可以根据用户体验或度量进行操作。我真的想打破那个迷因。当数据以正确的方式使用时，会让你对用户产生共鸣。我以前说过的一个例子是，我们在Facebook上发布了一款产品，你可能在你的42英寸大显示器上见过，这里没有一个42英寸的大显示器，但我相信你们中的一些人在家里也会这么做。这是在右边，所有你可以在Facebook上聊天的朋友，但最重要的是，它有一个故事列表，正在滴答作响，叫做“滴答”(Ticker)。当你在一个小屏幕上的时候，这个产品通常会折叠到Facebook的右边栏中，然后向下推，这样你就可以看到这些故事在滴答作响。这个产品对我们这些朋友非常有用，他们在大屏幕上创建了大量的内容。但如果你去菲律宾，那里网吧的使用率很高，人们都在狭小的屏幕上，他们中的大多数人最终都在右边的专栏里，他们中的大多数人与Facebook的参与度很低，看不到你可能认识的人。因此，我们实际上失去了与我们完全不同的用户之间的友谊，我们只能通过查看这些数据，然后说：“啊，为什么小屏幕上的情况不好，大屏幕上的情况很棒呢？”为什么对低参与度的用户和超级的超级用户不那么好呢？“这是因为我们用这些数据来理解这些在硅谷与我们不同的用户。现在好好想想。

I presume I don't know,  I'm seeing a lot of Apple product here, I have a Lenovo at the moment.  But most of you probably have iPhones, who has iPhone? Yeah, who has an Android?  You're the best. Most people in the world are using Androids, but everyone in this  room has an iPhone first and foremost. You don't understand, I'm actually forgetting how to  use iOS now which is actually a problem in my job, but like I've got  an Android because the majority, like huge but maybe not the majority, a vast number  of our users use Android as Jan said in the last talk. And I need  to understand what the Android operating system offers. But I can't understand Android and iOS  well as a user at the same time, so I use data to understand what's  going on in iOS. You need to gain empathy for your users, and research is  great, and talking to your customers is great, but if you listen to the Twitch  guy Emmett, you know, talk to your users then go away and build the product  to serve them, and look at the data in my opinion would be the next  thing to validate if you built the right thing, if you're doing the right thing,  if your research actually ties up with what your users have said to you. So  data gives you empathy.

我想我不知道，我在这里看到了很多苹果产品，我现在有一个联想。但你们中的大多数人可能都有iPhone，谁有iPhone呢？是啊，谁有机器人？你是最好的。世界上大多数人都在使用安卓系统，但是这个房间里的每个人首先都有一部iPhone。你不明白，我现在忘了怎么使用iOS-这实际上是我工作中的一个问题，但就像我有了Android一样，因为大多数用户，像大多数人一样，但可能不是大多数人，我们的大量用户使用Android，正如Jan在上一次演讲中所说的那样。我需要了解Android操作系统提供了什么。但是我不能同时理解Android和iOS，所以我用数据来理解iOS中发生的事情。你需要为你的用户获得同理心，而研究是很棒的，和你的客户交谈也是很棒的，但是如果你听了特维奇人Emmett的话，你知道，然后和你的用户交谈，然后去构建产品来为他们服务，在我看来，如果你构建了正确的东西，那么接下来要验证的就是数据。如果你的研究与你的用户所说的联系起来，你做的是正确的事情。所以数据会让你产生共鸣。

It's not a trade off between metrics and users.

这不是度量和用户之间的权衡。

If you  build the right metrics, you are optimizing for the users. Two, data predicts the future.  Over, and over, and over again, and I love this quote, it's a science fiction  author I think. But the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet. So,  those curves that show you the retention, when I said that you can look at  your total addressable market and say, "If I signed them all up, how much revenue  would I get?" Or you just look at who you signed up today. Let's say,  back in those days we signed up a thousand advertisers in a day.

如果您构建了正确的度量标准，那么您将为用户进行优化。第二，数据预测未来。一遍又一遍，我喜欢这句话，我认为这是一位科幻作家。但未来在这里，只是还没有均匀分布。所以，那些曲线显示了你的保留，当我说你可以查看你的可寻址市场，然后说，“如果我把它们都签了，我会得到多少收入？”或者你看看你今天签的是谁。比方说，在那些日子里，我们一天就签下了上千个广告商。

I could  tell you how much revenue they would contribute a hundred days out because of that  curve. Now also, your users are going to ramp up. So a user who shops  in one category, if you're eBay or if you're Amazon, and then buys in a  second category and a third category is clearly going to get more valuable, right? Shopping  the shop, driving up same store sales is a common technique in e-commerce. Okay, so  how many of your users are increasing the number of categories they're shopping in? You  see someone sign up, what likelihood is it that they're going to add extra categories  and what is your revenue going to be in the future? You can predict that  with data. AB tests are another great thing. See all these people walking in the  science march, believing in science, and then when you apply the scientific method to their  product and run an AB test, they shipped the thing that looked bad in the  AB test, because they didn't believe the AB test.

我可以告诉你，由于这条曲线，他们将在一百天内贡献多少收入。现在，您的用户也将增加。因此，如果用户在一个类别购物，如果你是eBay或亚马逊，然后在第二类和第三类购买，显然会变得更有价值，对吗？在电子商务中，购物，推动同一家商店的销售是一种常见的技术.好吧，那么你的用户中有多少人在增加他们购买商品的种类呢？你看到有人注册，他们增加额外类别的可能性有多大？你未来的收入是多少？你可以用数据来预测。AB测试是另一件伟大的事情。看到所有这些人在科学游行中行走，相信科学，然后当你把科学方法应用到他们的产品上并进行AB测试时，他们运送了AB测试中看起来很糟糕的东西，因为他们不相信AB测试。

I see that with all kinds  of startups I talk to. AB tests tell you what's going to happen when you  ship then 100 percent, use them.

我看到了与我交谈的各种初创公司。AB测试告诉你当你装运的时候会发生什么，然后百分之百地使用它们。

It works. Finally, and this is something Mark actually  added recently for me, data helps you make decisions faster.

它起作用了最后，这是Mark最近为我添加的东西，数据可以帮助您更快地做出决定。

If you can not, as  the CEO, have to have a conversation over something where you could just run a  test, your company is going to be able to move quicker because every decision won't  have to come to you. People in the team, if they're clear on what that  goal is, that north star metric is, they can run the test, see if they  move the metric, and then only come to you when they know if they've moved  the metric or not. Decisions like that help you move faster. Knowing what your most  important priority is because you've looked at the data, that helps you move faster. Make  sense? Cool. So now, you wanted to push for as much of the time as  possible so I'm pushing for as much of the time as possible. So let's talk  about tactics. First hundred users, Sam talked about this brilliantly, if you actually listen I  thought Tracy in the previous conversations was just fantastic when she talked about getting 30  of her friends in the construction industry to try PlanGrid, and then asking them to  pay and 29 of them kept paying. Like, ask your friends first for your first  hundred customers. Get people who will give you honest feedback, and I love the point  about "Make them pay," if it's a paid product. Second, research and then reach out  to who you'd like to have as your users. Totally makes sense, right? Like, you  can do what ... Like, how Oscar was discovered by the Lob team. Right, just  email a bunch of people. Don't get caught in a spam filter, don't just auto-generate  emails or you'll definitely get caught in a spam filter. But send personal emails, get  introductions. See which friend you have in common.

如果你不能，作为首席执行官，必须就你只需进行一次测试的事情进行一次对话，你的公司将能够更快地行动，因为每一个决定都不会出现在你的面前。团队中的人，如果他们知道目标是什么，北极星度量是什么，他们可以运行测试，看看他们是否移动了度量，然后只有当他们知道他们是否移动了度量时才会来找你。这样的决定能让你行动更快。了解您最重要的优先事项是因为您已经查看了数据，这有助于您更快地移动。说得通吗？凉爽的所以现在，你想争取尽可能多的时间，所以我要尽可能多地争取时间。那么让我们谈谈战术。最初的100个用户，Sam谈到了这个非常精彩的话题，如果你真的听了，我认为Tracy在之前的对话中非常棒，她谈到让她的30位建筑行业的朋友尝试PlanGrid，然后要求他们付费，其中29人继续付费。比如，先向你的朋友询问你的前一百位顾客。找一些能给你诚实反馈的人，如果这是一种付费产品，我很喜欢“让他们付出代价”的观点。第二，研究，然后接触到你想要谁作为你的用户。完全合情合理，对吧？比如，你可以做什么.。比如奥斯卡是如何被洛布团队发现的。好吧，给一群人发邮件。不要被垃圾邮件过滤器捕获，不要只自动生成电子邮件，否则你肯定会被垃圾邮件过滤器捕获。但是发个私人邮件，做个自我介绍。看看你们有什么共同之处。

I emphasize by the way, I have  never started a startup so I might be entirely the wrong person to tell you  about first hundred users, but Sam asked me to. Third, social media and PR. PR  is non scalable but it can give you amazing bumps, amazing bumps. And in the  early days I think PR is a good growth lever. Later on I think companies  don't realize when PR has stopped being a growth lever, because they have these other  metrics. But you can get this great one time bumps, just know you can't get  them every single week, and sometimes they are a one off. And finally, buy ads.  I am not as against ads as Sam is as a great method for growing  users.

顺便强调一下，我从来没有开过一家初创公司，所以我可能是一个完全错误的人来告诉你关于前100个用户的信息，但是Sam让我这么做的。第三，社交媒体和公关。PR是不可扩展的，但它可以给您带来惊人的颠簸，惊人的颠簸。在早期，我认为公关是一个很好的增长杠杆。后来，我认为公司没有意识到公关已经不再是一个增长杠杆，因为他们有这些其他指标。但是你可以一次又一次的颠簸，只是知道你不可能每一周都得到它们，有时它们是一次性的。最后，买广告。我不反对广告，因为山姆是一个很好的方法来增加用户。

I think that buying ads can be absolutely fantastic, I built my career buying  ads. Two of the most valuable internet companies, Google and Facebook make all their revenue  form selling ads. Like, ads are actually a good thing if you get the targeting  right, and we're going to talk about that in a second.

我认为购买广告是绝对了不起的，我建立了我的职业生涯购买广告。两家最有价值的互联网公司，谷歌(Google)和Facebook，其所有收入都来自于销售广告。就像，广告实际上是一件好事，如果你正确的目标，我们将讨论这个问题。

If you are having  a growth team, if you are focused on growth tactics, what people talk about as  growth hacking, although I hate the term.

如果你有一个成长团队，如果你专注于增长策略，人们所说的“增长黑客”，尽管我讨厌这个词。

If you pour fuel, this is a picture  from a guy called Nick on my team, Nick , and I did not tell  him to hold his hand into the flames, which we'll see in a second.

如果你加油的话，这是我团队里一个叫尼克的家伙的照片，我没有告诉他把他的手握在火堆里，我们马上就能看到。

If  you pour lighter fluid onto dead coals with no spark, you get nothing. And if  there's one thing to take away from this lecture, you need to have product market  fit to drive growth, you need retention to drive growth, otherwise every growth tactic, every  acquisition tactic you could possibly run doesn't matter. But, if you have a spark there,  if you have a glowing ember, you can pour fuel on the fire of your  product and that is what growth tactics does. So I look at things based on  channel, targeting, creative, and then conversion. So, if you think about channel, and I'm gonna  try and do some greatest hits here.

如果你在没有火花的情况下把打火机的液体倒到死煤上，你什么也得不到。如果有一件事要从这堂课中学到，那就是你需要有适合于推动增长的产品市场，你需要保留以推动增长，否则每一种增长策略，每一种你可能使用的收购策略都无关紧要。但是，如果你有火花在那里，如果你有一个发光的余烬，你可以倒燃料的火，你的产品，这是什么增长策略所做的。所以我从渠道，目标，创意，然后转换的角度来看待事物。所以，如果你想一想频道，我会在这里尝试做一些最棒的作品。

If you look at SEO, you have to  think about key word research. Which key words do I want to show up for  on Google, on the other search engines, and make sure you have content targeted against  those key words. You need to get links. Links from the internet to your site.  If you're a Silicon Valley startup, you typically get a lot of links off high  value sites, so you usually don't have to worry about that. But then you need  to link inside your site. Many people will tell you links don't matter anymore.

如果你看SEO，你必须考虑关键词研究。哪些关键词我想在谷歌上出现，在其他搜索引擎上，并确保你有针对这些关键词的内容。你需要找到链接。链接从互联网到您的网站。如果你是一家硅谷的初创公司，你通常会从高价值网站上得到很多链接，所以你通常不用担心这个问题。但是你需要在你的网站内链接。很多人会告诉你链接不再重要了。

In  my experience that is not true.

根据我的经验，这不是真的。

I don't know why it's not true, but it's  not been true in my experience. And then finally there are a bunch of basics  out there on SEO. You can read them up, there are a load of websites  that talk about them. SEO , Moz, there are a bunch of websites out there  you can read about SEO tactics. Four page search. The biggest thing I see people  do wrong is they don't think about incrementality. They buy page search and they don't  necessarily say, "Well, would I have got those customers anyway?" So look really hard.

我不知道为什么这不是真的，但在我的经验中这不是真的。最后，在SEO上有一堆基本知识。你可以把它们读出来，有很多网站都在谈论它们。搜索引擎优化，莫兹，有一堆网站，你可以阅读有关SEO战术。四页搜索。我看到人们做错事的最大原因是他们不考虑怀疑。他们购买网页搜索，他们不一定会说，“好吧，我会有那些客户吗？”所以好好看看。

If  you're gonna buy page search as a startup, you should see a step change in  your line. Your marketing team, if you've reached the stage where you have a marketing  guy, should show you a line that is flat, and then they turn on page  search and it goes up. That's the same of any ads if you are a  small startup.

如果你打算把页面搜索作为一家初创公司来购买，你应该看到你的行中出现了一步的变化。你的营销团队，如果你已经达到了你有一个营销人员的阶段，应该给你展示一条平直的线条，然后他们打开页面搜索，然后它就会上升。如果你是一家小公司的话，所有的广告都是一样的。

If you're a big company, incrementality analysis, there's this great Berkeley professor Steve  Tadelis, who's done a deep study in it with eBay that I love and I  think he's really smart. Big companies, you have to be really very smart about getting  incrementality. You're a small startup, show me a step change. Do think about marginal, not  absolute ROI. So people always look at like, I spent this much, I got this  much, how valuable is it? That's not what you want to look at. You want  to look at the last dollar you spent, how much did you get for that?  Not overall. Does that make sense? Not as many nods.

如果你是一家大公司，增量分析，有一位伟大的伯克利大学教授史蒂夫·塔德里斯，他在eBay上做了一项深入的研究，我很喜欢，我认为他真的很聪明。大公司，你必须非常聪明，才能让人感到怀疑。你是个小公司，给我换个步子。一定要考虑边际投资，而不是绝对的投资回报率。所以人们总是认为，我花了这么多钱，我得到了这么多钱，它有多值钱？这不是你想看的。你想看看你最后花了多少钱？不是整体的。这有道理吗？没那么多点头。

I'm going to blast through  that. Look at marginal ROI, look at diminishing return curves in economics. And then again,  you need to do your keyword research. So email, SMS, and push notifications. This is  something every startup gets wrong. We always optimize for ourselves. Have you seen the Instagram  thing on the internet where someone shows a phone of an Instagram user with a  million followers when they've posted something and they have push notifications on, and the stream  just goes, and all the notifications are coming in at high speed? That's what we're  like for our own products. For our products, we're the power users. And by nature  every startup I have gone and talked to has always optimized for themselves. Has always  optimized for the power user. And so by optimizing for the power user, what do  you do? Well, we shouldn't put that on by default because it's gonna completely spam  my home screen. Power users are smart, if you give them the options they know  how to turn off notifications.

我要把它炸开。看看边际收益，看看经济学中递减的收益曲线。再说一遍，你需要做你的关键词研究。因此，电子邮件，短信，和推送通知。这是每一家初创公司都会出错的事情。我们总是为自己优化。你有没有在互联网上看到过Instagram的事情，有人在Instagram上展示了一个拥有一百万粉丝的用户的手机，当他们发布了一些信息，并且他们有推送通知时，流就会消失，所有的通知都会以高速的速度发送过来吗？我们自己的产品就是这样。对于我们的产品，我们是超级用户。从本质上说，我去过的每一家创业公司都一直在为自己进行优化。一直在为超级用户优化。因此，通过优化功能用户，您会做什么？嗯，我们不应该在默认情况下戴上它，因为它会把我的主屏幕完全垃圾化。强大的用户是聪明的，如果你给他们的选项，他们知道如何关闭通知。

It's your marginal user you should care about with notifications.  That person for whom they receive their first like on Instagram, or the host that  gets their first notification on AirBnB, or the seller that gets their first bid on  eBay, or the buyer who's just been outbid in their first item. That's the person  that needs to get the notification and needs to respond to it, and you need  to optimize for in your head. Marginal user is the number one thing.

您应该通过通知来关心您的边际用户。他们在Instagram上收到他们的第一次报价，或者在Airbnb上收到第一次通知的主机，在eBay上获得第一次报价的卖家，或者在他们的第一个项目中出价超过的买家。这是一个人需要得到通知，并需要回应它，你需要优化为在你的头脑。边际用户是第一位的。

In email,  SMS, push notifications, and even offline mail which Lob was talking about and is still  very important for many companies. People get wrong, they optimize for themselves. Beyond that, you  need to make sure it gets delivered, opened, clicked on, et cetera. There's so much  more here and if I push through all of it I'm not going to get  to any questions. Do you want me to get to questions?
Speaker 1: This is pretty important. How about this and no questions.

在邮件、短信、推送通知，甚至离线邮件中，LOB一直在谈论，对许多公司来说仍然是非常重要的。人们会犯错，他们会为自己优化。除此之外，你需要确保它被传递，打开，点击等等。这里有更多的东西，如果我把所有的东西都推过去，我就不会回答任何问题了。你想让我回答问题吗？演讲者1：这很重要。这个怎么样？没有问题。

Alex Schultz: This and no questions.

亚历克斯·舒尔茨：这个问题没有问题。

Is everyone okay with that? Is that okay. Okay, sweet. So  think about on-site merchandising. You own a lot of media. There's this idea of earned,  bought, and owned media, does that make sense? So if you post on Facebook and  it gets loads of likes you've earned that media, right? If you bought an ad  on Facebook or Google or somewhere, you've bought that media. And then if they're on  your own website, you own that media. People underestimate the value of owned media.

大家都同意吗？这样行吗。好吧，亲爱的。所以想想现场销售。你拥有很多媒体。有这样的想法-挣来的，买的，拥有的媒体，这有意义吗？所以，如果你在Facebook上发帖，它得到了大量的赞，你已经赢得了媒体，对吗？如果你在Facebook、谷歌或其他地方买了一则广告，你就买下了那个媒体。如果他们出现在你自己的网站上，你就拥有了媒体。人们低估了拥有的媒体的价值。

If  you have a lot of traffic on your site, ask them to invite their friends.  Ask them to complete that next action in your product. Think about your on-site merchandising  as an extension of your product, but understand the on-site merchandising is a marketing problem.  So, how can you trigger the right thing? Someone has just bought and item for  you, immediately like Amazon does, trigger for the a set of suggestions of like, why  don't you buy this, this, and this? Or customers who bought this also bought this.  Works incredibly well. What about creative? Creative is really important.

如果你的网站上有很多流量，请他们邀请他们的朋友。让他们在你的产品中完成下一个动作。把你的现场销售看作是你产品的延伸，但是要明白现场销售是一个营销问题。那么，你怎么能触发正确的事情呢？有人刚给你买了东西，就像亚马逊一样，引发了一系列的建议，比如，你为什么不买这个，这个呢？或者买了这个的顾客也买了这个。效果非常好。那创意呢？创意真的很重要。

It should be personalized, because  they're on your site, you know their name. "Hey Alex, why don't you buy these  items that other similar customers have bought?" Performs way better than "Buy these other items  that similar customers have bought." That's one similar personalization. But instead of just saying, "This  customer bought this item," you should do a prediction. "This person, all the items they've  ever bought, let me predict for them in a personalized way what item they should  buy." Look at Facebook and how often we say "Five of your friends have done  x." Social context, that's personalization. Use people's own profile picture. We have a great personalization  example where when you are on a Facebook page, we show you what your ad  would look like if you bought it with a "Buy this" button underneath it.

应该是个性化的，因为他们在你的网站上，你知道他们的名字。“嘿，亚历克斯，你为什么不买这些其他类似顾客买的东西呢？”比“购买类似客户购买的其他商品”要好得多。这是一个类似的个性化。但是，不要只是说“这个顾客买了这个东西”，你应该做一个预测。“这个人，所有他们买过的东西，让我以个性化的方式为他们预测他们应该买什么东西。”看看Facebook，我们经常说“你的五个朋友做了x”。社会背景，这就是个性化。使用人们自己的个人资料图片。我们有一个很好的个性化例子，当你在Facebook页面上的时候，我们会向你展示你的广告会是什么样子，如果你购买它下面有一个“购买这个”按钮。

It  could not be more personalized. On-site merchandising gives you so many opportunities to deeply, deeply  personalize the creative. And finally, paid and organic social.

再个性化不过了。现场销售为您提供了如此多的机会，以深入，深入个性化的创意.最后是付费和有机社会。

I do work for Facebook, we  do make all of our money from ads, and I personally think that I am  not the best person to speak about buying ads on Facebook, because I'm the guy  that buys ads off Facebook to drive traffic to Facebook. But what I'll say is,  if I left Facebook today and I was at a startup, I would be crazy  not to use our custom audiences and look-alike targeting. So I highly, highly encourage you  if you think about nothing else on Facebook ads, to look into those.

我确实为Facebook工作，我们从广告中赚到了我们所有的钱，我个人认为我不是谈论在Facebook上购买广告的最佳人选，因为我是从Facebook上购买广告来驱动Facebook流量的人。但我要说的是，如果我今天离开facebook，而我在一家初创公司，我会疯狂地不使用我们的定制观众和相貌相似的目标。所以，我强烈地鼓励你，如果你在Facebook广告上什么都不想，就去看看这些。

It's a  great way for you to say, "These are my best customers," upload the list to  Facebook, "How do I find more customers like those?" It works incredibly well for a  lot of companies. And the other thing across all social media is to a great  extent you're dealing with interesting squared, because the click through rate on your thing, the  like rate or whatever on your thing, will be related to how interesting it is,  and also the distribution, whether it's being shared via a messaging app, reshared on Twitter,  or on Facebook, will be driven by whether people found it interesting. Make sense? Cool.  Okay. Targeting. Behavioral is most important, so what you did is much more important than  who you are. There are 50 year old, 60 year old parents and grandparents who  need two friends to be active on Facebook, and there are some who need 500,  and there are teenagers who need 500 friends, and some who need two. And you're  much better to figure out, like, what is the behavior that tells you that, than  say on a demographic basis I'm going to do this versus this. You know? People  who buy Nikes, men's Nike trainers, typically are men. But sometimes buy for their boyfriend,  or their husband, or their dad, or whatever. And so if you just target women  with women's trainers and men with men's trainers, you are making a mistake. What you  should do is look at what signals you to show the right ad, or the  right content to the right person at the right time. Targeting matters.

这是一个很好的方式，你可以说，“这些是我最好的客户，”上传到Facebook，“我如何找到更多这样的客户？”它对很多公司来说都非常好。所有社交媒体的另一件事是，你在很大程度上是在处理有趣的平方，因为对你的东西的点击率，同样的比率，或者你的东西上的任何东西，都将与它的有趣程度有关，而且它的发布，无论是通过一个消息应用分享，在Twitter上重塑，还是在Facebook上，都将取决于人们是否觉得它有趣。讲得通凉爽的好的。瞄准目标。行为是最重要的，所以你所做的比你是谁更重要。有50岁的，60岁的父母和祖父母，他们需要两个朋友才能在Facebook上活跃，有些人需要500个朋友，有些青少年需要500个朋友，有些需要两个朋友。你最好弄清楚，是什么行为告诉了你这一点，而不是从人口统计学的角度说，我要做这个和这个。你知道购买耐克男士运动鞋的人通常都是男性。但有时会给他们的男朋友，他们的丈夫，他们的爸爸，或者其他什么东西买东西。所以，如果你只针对女性教练的女性和男性教练的男性，你就犯了一个错误。你应该做的是看什么信号，你显示正确的广告，或正确的内容，在正确的时间给正确的人。目标问题。

I've talked about  this before. Okay, creative. Creative is important, but it's nowhere near as important as the  above two unless you have a ten x creative.

我以前也说过这个。好吧，有创意。创意是重要的，但它远比不上上面的两个，除非你有一个十倍的创造力。

If you produce the Dollar Shave  Club video, probably it's very, very worth it, but most people don't produce a piece  of creative that amazing that changes the world. Typically I find targeting comes before creative  in every single way, and channel comes before that. Does that make sense? So creative  is awesome and really important and can give you a big uplift, but think about  your channel first, and your targeting second.

如果你制作“美元剪刀俱乐部”的视频，它可能非常、非常值得，但大多数人都不会创作出一段能改变世界的令人惊奇的创意。通常情况下，我发现目标在每一种方式上都先于创造性，而渠道则在此之前。这有道理吗？所以创意是很棒的，也是非常重要的，可以给你一个很大的提升，但是先想想你的频道，然后再想想你的目标。

If you have creative though, you should put  it in context, you should personalize it, you should give it a call to action.  On call to action, this is a great example. Where, on every ad back in  the day on Facebook, we had a little link at the top that said "Advertise."  We translated it wrong by mistake in French, we found this with the data, and  in French we translated it to "Crée un ad", create an ad. And we had  significantly more, actually 40 percent more acquisition from that channel that was at the time  our single most important channel for advertiser acquisition. We took the French translation and we  reverse translated it and changed the whole world.

如果你有创造力，你应该把它放在背景中，你应该个性化它，你应该给它一个行动的号召。这是一个很好的例子。在Facebook上的每一个广告中，我们在顶部都有一个小链接，上面写着“广告”。我们错误地用法语翻译错了，我们用数据找到了这个，在法语中我们把它翻译成“Crée un ad”，创建一个广告。我们有更多，实际上是40%以上的收购渠道，这是当时我们唯一最重要的广告商收购渠道。我们采用了法文翻译，并将其反向翻译，改变了整个世界。

Instead of saying the kind of passive  "Advertise" to the active "Create an ad" and we achieved a 40 percent bump in  that most important channel for us, for advertiser acquisition. That is the call to action.  Like what you say matters. So when I say creative doesn't matter as much as  channel and targeting, it still matters a lot. And the words you use matter a  lot. This is the example I said about in context with intent, if you are  on your own page, this used to be the ad we would show to you  that say, "Hey! This is what your ad would look like elsewhere on the site."  And you can see that by hour, this was the hour that we doubled advertiser  acquisition for Facebook, with the push of the weekly push.

而不是说那种被动的“广告”的主动“创造一个广告”，我们实现了40%的冲击，在这个最重要的渠道，对我们来说，广告商的收购。这就是行动的号召。就像你说的很重要。所以当我说创意不如渠道和目标重要的时候，它仍然很重要。你用的词很重要。这就是我故意在上下文中说过的例子，如果你在你自己的网页上，这曾经是我们给你展示的广告，上面写着：“嘿！这就是你的广告在网站其他地方的样子。”你可以看到，一小时，随着每周的推送，我们把Facebook的广告商收购量翻了一番。

If you want to see  more about this, Brian Hale does a great talk about this at F8, and it's  online. And then the last thing, yes. The last thing is conversion. Conversion is really,  really important but it's not important until you've thought about all the other things first.  So things to think about with conversion, the landing page people land on will determine  what your conversion rate is going to be.

如果你想看更多关于这个，BrianHale做了一个很好的讨论，在F8，它在网上。最后一件事是的。最后一件事就是皈依。转换是非常重要的，但是它并不重要，除非您先考虑了所有其他的事情。所以要考虑的事情转换，登陆页面上的人将决定你的转换率是多少。

If you can, don't have one button  on it that they then have to click to go to the registration form. Put  the registration form in the landing page.

如果可以的话，不要在上面有一个按钮，然后他们必须点击才能进入注册表格。把登记表放在登陆页上。

It's important to know what your most important  metric is though. Back at eBay, what we had was this original metric, confirmed registered  users, and a new metric, activated confirmed registered users. And an activated confirmed registered user  was someone who bought an item, bid on an item, listed an item. And a  confirmed registered user was someone who registered and confirmed and that was it. To get  confirmed registered users, we wanted to pump all of our search traffic, this was back  in 2004, we were spending huge amounts on search. We wanted to pump all of  our search traffic at the registration page. To get activated confirmed registered users, we actually  wanted to land it on the search term that you were looking for. So if  you were looking for a trampoline, show you the trampolines you could buy on eBay.  That change, and we changed all of our advertising to change the landing page, dropped  confirmed registered users significantly that we were acquiring for eBay. But it increased activated confirmed  registered users.

知道你最重要的标准是什么是很重要的。回到易趣，我们有一个原始的标准，确认注册用户，和一个新的度量，激活注册用户。被激活的注册用户是那些购买了一个项目，出价一个项目，列出了一个项目的人。一个已确认的注册用户是一个注册和确认的人，就是这样。为了获得确认的注册用户，我们想泵出我们所有的搜索流量，这是在2004年，我们花了大量的搜索。我们想在注册页面上输入我们所有的搜索流量。为了激活已确认的注册用户，我们实际上想将其登录到您正在寻找的搜索项上。所以如果你在找蹦床，给你看看你可以在易趣上买的蹦床。这一变化，我们改变了我们所有的广告，改变了登陆页面，大幅降低了我们为eBay收购的注册用户。但它增加了活跃的注册用户。

It increased revenue and lifetime value per registered user, and it increased total  revenue per day from the people we were acquiring. So although I think you can  focus on the registration form really hard, in e-commerce sometimes it's really, really important to  land people on what they're searching for so that they will activate and they will  buy on your service. So it's not as simple as just put the registration form  online. But we did do that at Facebook. So the final thing I'd like to  say is Facebook moves fast. And move fast is an absolute core value for us  as a company. Like core, core, core value, and we still do bold things like  taking messenger out of Facebook, that was challenging at the time but I think people  have now seen how valuable a decision that was. And that was a project that  I was deeply involved with and ran. We're willing to move fast, we're willing to  be bold. Because fundamentally, a good plan violently executed on today is better than a  perfect plan next week. Data helps you move fast, these growth tactics help you move  fast. Talks about making decisions with 70 percent of the data, not 90 percent of  the data, and I deeply believe in that. So move fast, focus on retention, and  have one key metric that you care about for your company's growth. Thank you. Okay,  apparently we have time for one question.

它增加了每个注册用户的收入和终身价值，并增加了我们正在购买的用户每天的总收入。所以，虽然我认为你可以很难集中精力在注册表格上，但在电子商务中，让人们了解他们正在寻找的内容，从而激活他们，让他们在你的服务上购买，这是非常重要的。所以这并不像把登记表放在网上那么简单。但我们确实在Facebook做过。所以我想说的最后一件事是Facebook动作太快了。作为一家公司，快速发展是我们的绝对核心价值。像核心，核心价值，我们仍然做一些大胆的事情，比如把信使从Facebook上带走，这在当时是很有挑战性的，但我认为人们现在已经看到了这个决定是多么的有价值。这是一个我深入参与并运行的项目。我们愿意迅速行动，我们愿意勇敢。因为从根本上说，一个好的计划，在今天暴力执行，比一个完美的计划，下周。数据帮助你快速移动，这些增长策略帮助你快速移动。说到用70%的数据来做决策，而不是90%的数据，我对此深信不疑。因此，要快速行动，专注于留用，并有一个关键的指标，你关心你的公司的增长。谢谢。好吧，显然我们还有时间问一个问题。

I'm sorry. Go for it.

对不起勇敢点儿

Speaker 3: So you mentioned that for the magic moment we can kind of tell when they  happen, but how do you think about creating those
Alex Schultz: So the question was, for the magic moments you can kind of tell how you  can figure out when they happen, but how can you create them? I mean, honestly  if you look at LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, every social network in the known universe, what  we do is we immediately as you to import your contacts. So, once we know  that friends is the thing that we need to do for you, we focus on  what is the way to remove friction from getting you friends.

演讲者3：所以你提到过，对于这个神奇的时刻，我们可以知道它们何时发生，但你是如何看待创造出那些亚历克斯·舒尔茨的：所以问题是，对于那些神奇的时刻，你可以告诉你如何知道它们何时发生，但你如何创造它们呢？我的意思是，老实说，如果你看看LinkedIn，Facebook，Twitter，以及已知世界上的每一个社交网络，我们所做的就是像你一样立即导入你的联系人。所以，一旦我们知道朋友是我们需要为你做的事情，我们就专注于如何消除与你交朋友的摩擦。

If you look at  the example I used with eBay, we hadn't really figured out that activating you was  important to generating the revenue long term, so we shifted the landing page from the  registration form to the search results, so we got you to the item you wanted  to buy as quickly as possible, and that caused you to activate and get to  that magic moment faster. So, those are the kind of things. Once you identify it,  I actually think the tactics fall out very logically. My boss Havi likes to say  that common sense is the least common of all sense, and I agree with him.  But if you step back and you just look at, "Okay, if I want more  people to buy an item on eBay, should I land them on the registration page  or the search results page?" You'd probably land them on the search results page, and  that would get them to that magic moment faster. Thank you, okay.


如果你看一下我和eBay一起使用的例子，我们还没有真正意识到激活你对于创造长期收入是很重要的，所以我们把登陆页面从注册表格移到搜索结果上，所以我们尽快地把你带到你想要购买的物品上，这使得你能够更快地激活和进入那个神奇的时刻。所以，这些就是那种东西。一旦你确定了它，我实际上认为策略是非常合乎逻辑的。我的老板哈维喜欢说常识是所有常识中最不常见的，我同意他的观点。但是如果你后退一步，你只需看一看，“好吧，如果我想让更多的人在易趣上买一件商品，我应该把它们放到注册页面还是搜索结果页面？”你可能会在搜索结果页面上找到他们，这样他们就能更快地到达那个神奇的时刻。谢谢，好吧。
