# Live Office Hours with Kevin Hale and Dalton Caldwell

Dalton: Hey how is it going, we’re going to get started. Yeah I'm Dalton I'm a  partner at Y Combinator and we’re going to be doing office hours today.
Kevin: Yes.
Dalton: Yes.
Kevin: A couple of things to note, I know that a couple of live office hours  happen beforehand, we’re going to try to spend a little bit of time even after  these to talk with the different companies, 20 minutes for office hours is not a  normal time period that we'll do stuff. We’re going to try to do it as  fast as possible. Apologies in advance we might interrupt you just because we know how  short the time is to try to get as much information out of you for  us to communicate as well. All right thanks a lot. I think … How are  you doing?
Shruti: Good.
Kevin: Kevin.
Shruti: Shruti
Dalton: Kerry, yeah.
Kevin: Hi Shruti.
Dalton: Dalton how is it going? I think you’ll need to use the mic right? Yes  the hand held mic.
Shruti: Cool.
Kevin: Just very quickly introduce each of yourselves like your name your role with the company  and then name of the company and what you guys are doing?
Shruti: Yes I'm Shruti, we’re with HubHaus and this is-
Kerry: Kerry and I'm the CTO.
Shruti: I'm the CEO.
Kevin: Then what does HubHaus do?
Shruti: HubHaus does co-living we provide co-living spaces for professionals. If you're new to the area  you’ve just gotten here and you want to rent a room out and a house  with a curated community and you wanted to be set up you can move into  one of our rooms.
Kevin: Then what does co-living exactly mean?
Shruti: Co-living means living with a group of people so basically shared housing.
Kevin: How many people?
Shruti: Our houses are five to 10 people, some co-living spaces can range up to 30  but ours are 5 to 10.
Kevin: Then is the characteristic that you are sharing a bathroom with a bunch of other  people also kind of .
Shruti: Not necessarily some are, some don’t.
Kevin: Gotcha. Then how are things going for you guys so far?
Shruti: Pretty well, we launched 18 months ago, we are now at 220 tenancies across over  a dozen cities in the Bay Area and Los Angeles?
Kevin: What's the occupancy rate for this?
Shruti: We currently have occupancy rate of 94% most of the vacancy rate comes from our  launch vacancy. Our vacancy rate not including the first two weeks and the last two  weeks is about 2%.
Kevin: 2%, so when you say 94% like how many people does that mean in 220  properties?
Shruti: I'm sorry, so 220 tenants total.
Kevin: Tenants?
Shruti: Yes.
Kevin: Gotcha.
Shruti: 220 that includes. That doesn’t … We have more rooms than 220.
Kerry: We have about 230 rooms.
Kevin: 230 rooms.
Dalton: In terms of the timeline when did you first start, like you say 18 months  ago but what did that look like, the very first tenant I guess?
Shruti: Yes so first thing is we got a house and I was actually … We  both still live in our HubHaus’ but I moved into our very first HubHaus. Then  we got a bunch of tenants and the first few houses was very much so  a learning process we were trying to figure out what works, what doesn’t and try  to create this backbone for our co-living spaces. Does that answer the question?
Kerry: It took about seven, I think it’s seven houses in the first three months.
Dalton: OK and so you guys take on the lease? What are the terms of the  lease that you take out? It’s just a standard one year lease then it goes  month to month?
Shruti: I see, yeah so we do one year to two year leases for each of  our house and we continue with one year to two year.
Dalton: Do you need any special permission from the actual owner of the property to do  this?
Shruti: Yes so we’re completely upfront with the owners, we let them know exactly what we’re  doing we sell it as a benefit; we act as a property advisor to the  owners. We guarantee them rent every month even if the house is completely vacant.
Kevin: Then what’s the margin that you get currently?
Shruti: 30 to 40%.
Kevin: 40%, so let’s just say, let’s take a typical property about like one house that  has how many rooms on average?
Shruti: Six.
Kevin: Six rooms and then how much are you paying rent on that house?
Shruti: Roughly $6,000.
Kevin: $6,000, okay. Then you guys will make 40% on top of that usually through renting  out.
Dalton: If I'm property owner why is this a good deal? You said an advisor I  don’t really know what that means. Why am I like wow, please have a bunch  of people coming to my house and maybe it’s going to depreciate a lot.
Shruti: Yeah so most of our property owners have pretty large properties, which are hard to  rent out. We’re able to quickly rent out a house, which maybe rents for like  $6,000 to like 8,000, $9,000. Instead of having to deal with a typical remote situation  where you have to deal with five like six or seven-
Dalton: But the landlord doesn’t care about that as long as they get paid.
Shruti: Exactly.
Dalton: This has been going on a while the landlords is like I don’t care as  long as the rent shows up whatever you guys are doing, not my problem.
Shruti: Well so at the end at the end of the day as a landlord you  want one check, you want to make sure your house is taken care of and  you want professional people living there and you don’t want to have to deal with  it. We take care of all the hard stuff if there are any property problems,  which come up we advise them on what to do, but at the end of  the day all you're getting is one check and you don’t hear anything from us.
Kevin: What's the rate of so how are things going right now? You said you are  doing pretty well but is revenue increasing monthly weekly?
Shruti: Yeah so over the … We just raised around and after we raised we’ve kind  of scaled back and we’ve been growing out our teeth.
Kevin: Why would you scale back?
Shruti: We wanted to hire a team and we wanted to make sure to our processes  were going well.
Kerry: We were … Mic.
Shruti: Sorry.
Kerry: We were working about like 80 to 100 hour weeks each of us and we  were kind of reaching the limit of what we could do without team.
Kevin: Just think back so what is that rate of growth right now?
Shruti: About 8 to 10%.
Kevin: 8 to 10% a month?
Shruti: Yeah and we’re growing … Before that we were doing about 15 to 20%.
Kevin: How fast are you adding on new properties is that pretty much your bottleneck, finding  supply?
Shruti: Right now our bottleneck is operations. We want to make sure that each of our  houses is launching smoothly and well. That’s what-
Kevin: Right now you don’t have the playbook for launching it? How many properties do you  have?
Shruti: We have 40 properties.
Kevin: 40 properties and you feel like you still want … Why do you feel like  you don’t have the playbook after 40?
Shruti: I mean we definitely, we do have a playbook. We do have a step-by-step process  that we go through, but we've just gotten team on and we’re building out our  tech and training so that we’re able to scale sustainably and provide a fantastic experience  to each customer.
Dalton: When you say you want to build out a team to build tech and training  can you just dig into that a little bit? What do you need the team  to do?
Shruti: We now have a team, before until December I was the only full time person  working in December Kerry came on full time. Kerry was working as a co-founder before  that but he came on full time. Then we had one employee in December. The  past few months we hired on a property manager we hired on a person to  help out with partnership and we want a second developer to basically help us build  out the tech to automate a lot of these manual processes that we’re doing. Just  like responding to emails, responding to tenants with property management enquiries that come in, we  want to … There is ways to automate a lot of those steps.
Kerry: We do look at ourselves like a market but it’s not a true market place  because we’re not connecting the landlord with the tenants, and so we do have the  supply and demand factors of it. We found that it tends to go back and  forth between them
Kevin: That doesn’t make any sense to me, I don’t understand that?
Kerry: Which part?
Kevin: It’s two parts so right. You are connecting them together. I don’t get why-
Kerry: The tenants never deal with the landlord specifically. We’re not connecting landlord with the tenants  we have to make the deal with the landlord themselves.
Kevin: Right but it’s one ecosystem of supply and one ecosystem of demand and you are  bringing them together.
Kerry: That’s the way
Kevin: Regardless of how like the connections happen. It sort of works that way. What I'm  trying to figure out is how does this sort of win and the thing is  like do you feel like part of co-living is like this movement, people are realizing  I want to work and there is a lot, I'm not sure if I can  work with a bunch of other people. But the places where I want to work,  I take it you mostly are in the Bay Area, right.
Shruti: Yes we’re in the Bay Area and LA.
Kevin: It’s really expensive to get place and so for the places that I'm trying to  get in there really quickly I might not have enough capital to move it. Co-living  is a way to step into that. I'm trying to think is like do you  have a reliable source of supply for people where there is like … Let’s say  this is a really big trend that you are going to be able to onboard.  What I'm trying to figure out is like, at one point do you feel like  you are ready to add on new properties and at what rate do you add  on properties?
Shruti: We’re picking up approximately four to six houses a month.
Kevin: Four to six a month.
Shruti: Yeah.
Kevin: Okay and then how long are they vacant before … Like how long does it  take to get a house up and going?
Shruti: The time from when we sign a lease to the time the first person moves  in is about two weeks. The time from when we launch the house to when  it’s 100% full is another two weeks. About a month before it’s a completely up  and running HubHaus.
Kevin: About a month.
Dalton: We’ve seen a lot of people work on this idea and it seems like you  can get about as far as you have gotten, which is really great. But to  because you actually have take on the lease and because you have hard costs sometimes  these can look much more like a real estate business than a tech business. I  think what I kind of want to get at is are there ways that you  cannot hold the leases? Is there is a way you can make this much more  efficient from capital basis? Because right now this is basically a real estate business, right.  It sounds like there is some tech in there but I haven’t really gotten from  you that tech is like the differentiating factor that will make … It sounds like  it’s a lot of operations work to sign leases and then get people in units,  which is like pretty traditional residential housing type business. How are you thinking about what  let’s gets us huge? What are your thoughts along those lines?
Kerry: Part of that, so that is a good deal of tech I do agree that  it is not the key differentiating factor that we have. Some of it is different  and we automate a lot of the operations that are happening in front of this-
Dalton: What are those for like, hey the facet is broken can someone fix it and  you open a ticket is that what you mean? Can you tell me what that  means?
Kerry: More along the lines of automatically finding houses to go and see using some different  methods they are automatically posting. We have a constant in stream of probably about 100  tenants reaching out to us a day that’s being automated by tech. A lot of  the inter operations going between that is operated by tech. None of that’s very, some  of it’s unique, some of it’s not so much unique, I would say the bigger  differentiating factor, which we haven’t mentioned yet is the community fact that we build into  it, which is a lot of people come because it’s cheaper and because it’s a  place that they need quickly. We haven’t a very strong community element and create an  infrastructure in each house, so people are actually forming these really strong bonds.
Kevin: How do you make that happen?
Kerry: Part of that is we set up monthly dinners and we give them a format  of these are things you should go over and we throw events every month for  the entire community. We’re actually connecting these people and for that reason we’ve had a  continual growth. Well we start with month to month leases, we’ve moved up since then,  our average stay length has been a continual process upwards since the beginning and still  going.
Kevin: Quite honestly I feel like this really down comes down to cost, like people want  to move into cities, in places where it’s highly desirable but property is like non-abundant  and they are trying to figure out how can I get to this in a  cost affordable. Co-living was a way to sort of make it happen. You can advertise  all this community stuff that you can tell the people, but it’s no different from  an apartment or a condo complexes, it’s like hey we have this community stuff we  have a pool room, we have these wealthy dinners or barbecues. It doesn’t sound any  different because no one says like, we don’t have a community here, we don’t do  anything nice for the people, make sure there is a bunch of shady people living  inside of it. You don’t sound any differentiated from it. All I can think is  like this is pretty much it’s either land grab, you have more great properties than  anyone else. Then on boarding feels so simple and easy. Basically it’s like someone contacts  on you on average, how long before they’re moved in? Is that a month?
Shruti: No so it’s I mean it’s as short as a week or two. But I  think the difference is the house is … Access to rooms isn’t easily accessible right  now. Access to rooms and single family homes with curated communities the only way you  can get access to these is through Craig Lists or by setting it up yourself.  We’re unlocking a whole new market, which is.
Kevin: The whole thing is you build a brand to get people to trust you.
Dalton: For people in the audience are Dead Houses still a thing, Rob Levitsky anybody Dead  Houses anyone lived in Dead House .
Kevin: Yeah there is such a thing.
Dalton: Okay cool. Okay clearly there is people that want to do this and okay sounds  like we have about five minutes left. What are the things that you are thinking  about that can make this as constructive as possible. Just to summarize sounds good you  are making money like good job what might be tough is what's the move to  make this huge now let me give you some options. Sometimes people that working on  the startup idea decide to actually buy the properties because then you can renovate them.  Then you actually own an asset and it becomes almost again like a real estate  business and I have seen, that’s kind of the WeWork model right, so I’ve seen  that happen. On the other hand you could try to make this as asset light  possible or maybe you're not taking the obligation of the leases, right. Then you can  grow really fast and somehow have a special deal with the landlords where you can  just like grow really fast and then your true market place because you are holding  any of the liability that right now you are holding. Or you can again maybe  you found the just right compromise between the two. This is sort of where I  would think about from the long term perspective, do you have thoughts around where you  see this going in a year or two?
Shruti: The latter is probably the direction we’re going to go, the reason why we haven’t  is just because it hasn’t really been a problem until now. But in the future  as it does become more a problem we do want to shift more of the  liability to the property owners.
Dalton: Got it. One quick question while we’re on that, is there any insurance implications for  those? What kind of insurance do you have to take out?
Shruti: We do have a pretty comprehensive insurance policy to cover our properties if our tenants  do damage anything. Up to if the tenants burn down the house or something they  are recovered and then we are also asking our tenants to get renters insurance on  top of that.
Kevin: If your problem right is like operations and you are recruiting trying to find people  like what is your pitch to people to get people on board to say like  come and do this startup because, it’s not many peoples dream to be like, I'm  going to work on basically the new form of like apartment complexes or dorms, basically  dorms for like millennials.
Shruti: I mean so I think the biggest piece of our company is our community, each  of our house almost like a family like environment and people can really buy into  that. I mean I think a lot of people out here don’t really have access  to that and around universities sure some people have access to things like dead houses,  but most people out here move out here and lonely and don’t really know people.  Being able to offer this sense of community and the friendships that form from within  our community is the biggest pitch that we make.
Dalton: You think that’s the long term difference, really you think it’s ultimately the community, I'm  just trying to make sure I understand. You are saying like look we’re going to  have the best community and the best brand for community and that’s what will attract  people. Again with this kind of business it’s very easy for new entrants to come  in. If we use the example Airbnb anyone can make an Airbnb clone but what  they actually have is network effects, where just like eBay it’s hard compete with eBay  because they have the buyers and sellers. What's the equivalent here; it is the community  is that what you are saying?
Kerry: It is branding, a lot of that we do have an because it is not  just community and the houses, we connect all of the houses to each other as  well. We do have a bit of a network effect there. I do think branding  is the defensibility part. The other key part that Shruti’s mentioned to me in the  past is most of the competitors can do one or two things well. Campus was  a previous company who did something very similar but they had very low motion on  it and they did the community aspect really well. People loved staying in them but  the operations was awful. Then there is other companies that do the operations very well  but many people have come to us and said everybody talks about community but you  are the only ones with it. We feel that what we have is different but  we are also good at operations. That’s the part that we are trying to scale  and trying to hire for tech to turn it more and more into a tech  business. To take all the lengthy processes that are taking operations like we’re hiring for  more engineers right now and making that as automated as possible so we can do  less of the actual the signing of the leases and the direct things there.
Kevin: I think all the community stuff are good, it’s stuff for you to focus on  it will prevent churn from happening. But for the conversion, my feeling is your bottleneck  is probably still supply. Whatever it is you need to do is relieve yourselves on  what we want to take on properties. Because really what you have set up is  like your liability is that first month’s rent then you need to take on. Which  is pretty decent as far as capital If you can figure out how can I  turn around where like I sign a house, right then I could turn around, I  think you also have the part of safety like a security deposit also. It’s almost  two months worth of rent that you are taking on before you can have it  covered back. How long before you have that?
Shruti: It’s about a month, about a month.
Kevin: It’s going to be about two, no it’s going to be about four months, before  you cover both of them, before you cover two months worth of rent.
Shruti: Well we collect back security deposits from our tenants.
Kevin: Okay, and then I think that’s all that it comes down, like you need to  figure out how to do all the community stuff up ahead of time. But everything  that allows you say like I want to take as many properties as possible and  figure out how to jump start them. Get people into the houses or homes very  quickly without losing quality. The whole thing is like what is that exactly book like  and you want to almost time yourself. It’s like okay we, out a property how  long did it used to take, what is our checklist that is very, very reliable  for us to determine if it’s valuable or not, go in there and figure that  out. That’s where part of that tech is going to be, seeing like how much  can we do online. Then the second part of it is going to be we  send someone down there they do a very quick assessment and we have the team  that quickly turns around the place take the pictures, puts the listing out there and  gets it out to people. That’s like the first step, supply. Then your demand is  just like being very proactive on getting the demand so that a lot of the  people tenants like you get like testimonials, you send it out to whatever universities wherever  people might be looking for housing and to make sure that they all think like  HubHaus is the first place I go if I consider moving to a new city.  It’s like I want HubHaus to be there because I know that a good …  Even if it’s a transitory it’s like I want to go there be there for  maybe one to two months and then maybe I’ll trans into something better. Or some  percentage will say like I just want to stay here because this is the kind  of community I want to be with. Imagine most people eventually graduate nobody want to  live in a co-living forever, some people might, but that’s actually I think the thing  I most worry about co-living kind of like co-working space. The thing I always get  nervous about in terms of brand erosion is that it’s not an easy way to  like churn people out. The thing is like in places where you go where great  people will graduate, what ends up being is like it slowly starts rotting with people  who like can’t leave. It’s like I don’t have anyone else that loves me and  therefore wants to live with me. It looks online farms, it like co-working space, it’s  just like people don’t want to be in those spaces anymore because it’s like oh  it’s all filled up with people who never left and they start to get grumpy  et cetera. This is like one of those places. What you want to really pay  attention is how do I figure that out, how do I make sure this stays  fresh, how do I make sure that people who might be creating that will not  poison the rest of the house?
Dalton: Yes to paraphrase these kinds of business churn kills you. The founders never realize that  they have high churn until like … You may be like oh we have really  good churn everyone ever says that and you don’t have enough data yet. But over  the long run sometimes things can creep up on you. If all of a sudden  you start to have high churn then you are on the hook for all these  leases. Like these can get tricky. This is a lot of the food delivery type  startups there is a whole class of things that don’t work, they are like we  have positive margins and we have low churn and we have great … They all  say the same things, but if you really dig into them the secret hiding in  their numbers that the founders don’t want to admit to themselves is that actually churn  can get you and if you have hard cost like warehouses not for you but  for other people. If you have all these hard costs and then you have some  down months, like you have to pay your rent every month you can’t get out  of it.
Kevin: If community is everything.
Dalton: Yeah.
Kevin: Then the tools you want to think about also are like the equivalent of what  you might see in like moderation tools. We have to build all this stuff to  work on communities at scale how does that work for like within homes and houses  like who do we have to empower within our community to make them sort of  work and carry things onward? Lots of great real live communities that have grown to  be really big they have to be really careful like how they sort of set  that up. There is going to be delicate balance between that you are actually going  through right now between like I need to achieve growth and revenue but also need  to make sure the community is taken care. The moment I think you chose this  way above this, then there is the sacrifice. Thing is you have to figure out  how do I get these work in a way that doesn’t break everything. Hopefully this  trend and this the other thing I always worry about is that this is a  trend that just might break over time. Just people, cities and governments are building enough  housing that basically people are able to find cheap housing on their own, they just  live by themselves.
Dalton: From your perspective what do you think the biggest risk is, what do you …  Is it you need a higher operations crew, you know what I'm saying? What do  you think is the … In the future let’s say it didn’t work and you  were like men it was this reason if you had to guess, what do you  think that is?
Shruti: We definitely do run a risk that if the market crashes rents could just crash  and we are locked one to two year leases, which is why we try to  restrict it to one to two year leases. I think that’s a big one, can  you think of others?
Kerry: Yeah I think I would agree that that’s the number one risk the other part  is not being able to continue to scale because operations costs are not able to  be automated in a valid way.
Dalton: Yeah and like for your own edification I think a good thing to do would  be to amortize all of your costs for operations in your time when you are  calculating your margins. This is a classic thing people do it’s like we do food  delivery and we have positive margins, and it’s just a that they sell a burrito  for 10 bucks and it cost them seven bucks to make it. But if you  include delivery cost if you include support cost if you include returns like if you  actually bake in all this stuff they are definitely positive margins. I think in your  case just for your own edification try to back in some of these costs that  you have from an operations' basis.
Kevin: You have your 80 hours that you guys are burned out on.
Dalton: Yes you got to put those into your margin calculation. That will just help you  know that you are actually building a great business versus you are just like leaving  out some of the costs in your margin calculation.
Kevin: We are out of time, thank you very much
Shruti: Thanks.
Dalton: Thank you appreciate it, thank you.
Kevin: Thank you.
Dalton: Thanks.
Shay: Hi?
Dalton: Hi how is it going?
Kevin: Hi.
Shay: Good how are you guys?
Dalton: Good, okay so what's your name?
Ash: My name is Ash.
Kevin: Hi Ash.
Shay: Shay.
Dalton: How is going?
Kevin: Hi Shay.
Shay: Good nice to meet you. So we are Lambda Intelligence I'm CEO and we built  an API that allows developers to extract product information out of digitized receipts, so receipts  images and turns out there I huge volumes of data that’s locked up in these  receipts.
Kevin: OK before you go into your back story, can you really quick so who is  the customer?
Ash: We’re actually selling to mobile app developers. We’ve got a mobile app developer who we  just signed a contract with they are our first customer but they are paying us  2,000 bucks a month right now for processing, basically product information out of receipt images.
Dalton: Okay so you guys offer an API to be able to take receipts and just  like give structured information back after that.
Shay: Exactly.
Kerry: Yeah.
Dalton: Then can you give me one more use case why is this developer need this?
Ash: The core piece here is not just the OCR but it’s mapping the shortened product  descriptions and the prices to the actual product the full product name description brand all  of that type of structured information.
Dalton: But what is there app to, so why would I want to download their app  what do I get to do with it?
Ash: They are a loyalty card vendor.
Shay: They are using this to better their app and better target themselves to their customer  so that’s why they need this product information.
Dalton: I aways get nervous with API companies because basically API just like the bottom wrong  infrastructure for like software projects. They tend to want to be like commodities ultimately in  the end. The great API companies are going to be like okay if we’re going  figure out how to do this as cheaply as possible because this is going to  eventually going to become a commodity. Then like which ones are going after markets that  are super huge. That’s why I'm very interested in who the customer is, you are  like, mobile app developers that need to read receipts, how many of those are there  in the ecosystem.
Shay: That’s actually a good question. There are only 200 mobile app developers the second side  of the business that we are focusing on is that brands are really interested, deeply  interested in this type of data. We are in talks with one of the top  of brands with Craft and they’ve expressed interest in getting this type of data from  us.
Kevin: OK so your real customer is CPG companies.
Shay: Exactly.
Kevin: OK, so you do have like a multi step process you are like are you  giving the API away for free?
Ash: No.
Shay: No.
Kevin: Why not just give it for free, if the real customer is giant CPG companies  why not just be like mobile developers we have a really great OCR receipt reading  thing, have at it and then because you have the best data collecting all that  information then you are able to actually close these enterprises.
Ash: That’s kind of our plan going forward; right now we’re able to get some revenue  off of just providing this OCR, API to our mobile app vendors. That’s kind of  our way of boot strapping.
Kevin: I think it would just slow you down. The thing is like how boot strapped  are you? Are you going to run out of money by now?
Ash: We are completely boot strapped right now.
Kevin: I see.
Shay: Yeah right now they are paying $2,000 per month for processing their receipts this is  on track to scale up to 15,000.
Dalton: Sorry just like you process the receipts, what are you … The product data but  why are they giving you, that’s like a lot of money for an app developer  to give you, why are they … What is the thing that they can’t build  themselves that you can build that’s like super useful to them?
Ash: The thing that we got is that we’ve build a bunch of scrapers and we’ve  got some partnerships in works.
Dalton: Are you scraping their email are you going to … What are you scraping exactly?
Ash: We’re scraping receipt images, people take-
Dalton: OK the user-
Shay: Like physical receipts.
Dalton: Photographs-
Ash: A receipt.
Dalton: A physical receipt.  Yes.
Kerry: Yes.
Dalton: Then the app developer calls your API with … Pass it like a GIF and  then you OCR it and you are like okay this I what this thing says.
Shay: Exactly.
Ash: Yes then we structure it for them.
Dalton: Okay.
Ash: So that it’s not just the receipts but the discounts.
Dalton: They need that to do loyalty. Okay so I'm just making sure I really understand  exactly what your API does okay.
Shay: Yes.
Dalton: You get it?
Kevin: Yeah I do get it, it just makes me nervous because if your real customer  is a CPG what's your real business model. Like how much data do you need  to collect or Craft to say like we’ll even look at this. I know it’s  got to be a lot.
Ash: Yes, they want a million receipts a month.
Kevin: Got you. All the mobile app developers that potentially need this how much, is that  much … Because, I feel like the people who are mostly going to track receipts  are going to be people who are tracking expenses. But the only app I use  that I take a picture of my receipt, nothing consumer related do I do that.
Dalton: I mean there is loyalty stuff, but going along this line of thinking so if  your real customer is a CPG and this is sort of everyone can extrapolate from  this in the audience but maybe you should just be building the receipt tracking app  that does loyalty. It seems like you are trying to use this API thing as  like a shortcut and it’s going to be hard. But you are like whoa we  don’t really know how to get a million receipts, so let’s just build an APR  and like other people will get receipts. That kind of sounds like wishful thinking unless  … Again it’s great that you have this first customer so congrats on that. But  like to get a million receipts are they going to have a million receipts?
Ash: They are on tract … They want us to do about half a million receipts  right now. They are getting us close so we’ll need to work with a couple  of others.
Kevin: They are actually processing that many?
Ash: They are getting that many. That’s one of the reasons.
Dalton: Then okay along this line of thinking like and they are cool with this right,  because sometimes what's tough with an API company is if you are doing something and  that it’s really straight forward how you’re monetizing it. You are kind of middle man  and eventually people like squeeze middle men. Maybe they are like hey, this is really  valuable, maybe the app that you are selling the API to also wants to sell  us the CPGs. You see the tension there?
Ash: Yeah.
Shay: Yeah we see that an actually we’ve done research and CPGs are buying lots of  data from third party companies like Oracle, Datalogix Experian they are spending millions of dollars  to get this type data. What's interesting is that this data is more aggregated in  nature that it’s mostly transactional. What we are getting at is like product level data  that we are focusing on which we know like brands really want.
Dalton: That makes sense but I think just from as scale perspective, like my understanding of  what data brokers want for ad targeting is like tens of millions of hundreds, like  the scale that you need to build a data business is much larger, like you  have seen anyone. Even with millions even for millions they give you the-
Kevin: The closest I have seen that people doing this is like they are offering companies  for free, so grocery stores, electronic stores retailers they see for free e-receipts. They say  like we offer this technology e-receipt is for free and then what they do is  they take all the data and what they have is it’s good for those customers  it’s good for the retailers because they are getting information they wouldn’t have otherwise about  their customer base. Then they resell the data as the CPG and like even like  bigger retailers. The whole thing is race to the data. It feels like I closed  this company they are doing half a million receipts okay maybe this is easier than  I think. Then like what's the barrier for you closing more people?
Ash: Right and I think that’s something that we’re actively trying to go after more of  these kind of data sources and so the more data sources that we can get  that obviously then proves the value of our.
Dalton: Yeah.
Kevin: How is that going? You said there is like 200 so have you emailed all  200?
Ash: We’ve emailed about 100 of them so far.
Kevin: What have you learned?
Shay: We’ve learned, our response rate has been about 25% so far and we’ve learned that  the current mobile app lender that’s providing us this data like them others are also  interested and they are willing to show that data because they are experiencing similar problems.  They have all of these-
Kevin: You had 25 people respond to you why are they not customers that’s actually the  question I'm interested in.
Ash: We actually only launched our private data with this mobile app lender about a week  and a half go so we’re still super early on this. We’ve got a list  of meetings next week. One of the reasons why they are not customers yet is  because our sales cycle is a little bit I think probably at least a month  or two.
Kevin: It’s still pretty good.
Shay: Yeah.
Ash: Yeah.
Kevin: But I mean these aren’t really enterprise prices that you are charging?
Ash: Right.
Kevin: Okay I think for an API like the biggest thing is like any API is  like you have such a long cycle because you got to meet with like, you  want to see you have to someone actually try the thing, are people going to  be invested. Is it meeting at the right time right? It’s like the time that’s  developing the app and need to work on the future is that the time they  sort of need your product or service. It’s really a matter of you need all  cylinders going up once to have as many of those people try, because you don’t  know at what point and then all of a sudden there is a proper nexus  of the sale that actually close, or the usage to actually happen. When you talk  to like Craft how much were they willing to pay?
Ash: They were looking at 20 cents a receipt.
Kevin: 20 cents a receipts for a million receipts?
Shay: Yeah.
Ash: Yeah.
Kevin: Okay fascinating.
Dalton: One thing this is just like a general purpose piece of advice is like when  you are dealing with large corporates they employ lots of people in the business development  role and their job is to meet with people and to find innovative stuff all  the time. For every deal that they actually do and for every contract they execute,  they probably meet with a 100 startups. We meet with a lot of startups all  the time that have similar things where from their side of the table you just  ask for something crazy like go get a million receipts and then we’ll look at  it and maybe we’ll pay. You know I doubt they are saying that in writing,  right. Did they send you a contract?
Ash: No.
Dalton: OK well so you can give people these impossible tasks just like for fun and  see if they come back with it. Even if they do come back with it,  that doesn’t necessarily mean they are going to do the deal with you. We’re always  talking to startups that they believe the best case scenarios it’s so good to be  optimistic so I get why, but they believe the best case scenario the you know  hey this huge Fortune 500 company is going to do a deal with my two  person startup and they are going to give us a million dollars. Men just not  really. Like usually to pattern match here usually you have to stare stuff up and  you start with smaller customers that say yes more quickly and it’s for smaller dollar  amounts. You have to do that for quite a while before you are able to  get one of these deals. Sometime people call then silver bullet deals. It’s the deal  that makes your startup where you go from zero revenue to a million; somehow the  universe makes those very, those things rarely happen. I think in your case one negotiation  tactic here maybe is to be like hey we don’t have a million receipts but  why don’t we start with a pilot we do have whatever.
Kevin: Half a million.
Dalton: How about that let’s start with that and let’s just get this going and let’s  do our first data drop and let’s get this on paper. What you can do  when you negotiate with these kinds of people is to try to like if they  are saying come back with this really hard thing, and then maybe I’ll say yes,  move them down to something you can do, something that’s more minor. Then try to  get it in writing and once you get something in writing, it’s so much more  likely they’ll do the deal because talk is cheap is. Like anyone could say, oh  we’ll give you a million dollars if you do whatever. To get someone that works  at a corporation to put something in paper they will either come up with an  excuse why they can’t, or they are actually serious. Think about how much better that  would be for you as founders if you had something in writing, because then you  know this is real and that can give you so much more confidence that you  are going down the right direction. That’s always something I always suggest, this goes for  everybody where you‘re dealing with these big organization is try to get anything in writing.  You have five minutes.
Kevin: The thing I don’t like about this kind of code is inefficient. Like one you  working on like commodity level, data processing, is being set up and then you have  to do one thing before you can do the other thing all right. It’s a  two step process and so there is so many additional risks. To me it’s always  like I'm trying to get this other thing, how do I make that go really  fast to prove out this sort of nature. That’s why my first instinct is like  just make this free. If your mobile developers really want this and everything comes down  to you having as much data as possible and you make sure that you get  as much data as possible, as quickly as possible. That means like giving it, doing  it and doing it at a scale that other people won’t be able to sort  of compete. I firmly believe like down the line this technology for OCR processing for  receipts and stuff that’s going to be fairly common.
Dalton: Maybe this is a dumb question but is there a reason why like Expensify and  all the receipt tracking things aren’t just doing this. Like why can’t the CPGs get  access to all these other receipt tracking data things?
Ash: I mean what we’ve seen so far is that a lot of the accuracy levels  in receipts is still pretty low.
Dalton: Interesting.
Ash: Like especially because you can get the direct OCR that’s pretty good at this point.  But it’s going from that OCR kind of piece to an NLP piece that a  lot of companies either really-
Dalton: Do you actually need to skew is that what you are-
Ash: Yeah.
Dalton: Is that they can get pricing data but they don’t have the actual skew to  map it back.
Ash: Exactly because that’s exactly what it is.
Dalton: OK.
Ash: I mean it’s one of those things like this is a problem that I actually  solved and when I was co-founder at a healthcare company. We had lab forts that  we actually had to match to individual SNOMED lab codes. I did that there and  we were able to do it for 40 million patients.
Dalton: That’s great so here is something to think about when you are this stage, it’s  like you think about what are my strengths what are the things that we can  do really well that no one else can do and what are the area where  we’re on the same level playing field with everybody else. I feel like what I'm  getting from this conversation is that a lot of your strengths is in this technology.
Ash: Yeah.
Dalton: It is in the fact you can build this amazing OCR and it sounds like  you’ve been trying to find what the best possible market is. By doing a bunch  a of customer conversations you ended up saying, hey you know what CPGs have money  and we can use this technology, we already know we’re good at. I would think  of your core strength is be in the technology. Now on the CPG side until  you have your first thing in writing that’s still in the question mark. It’s not  not a strength but you don’t, it’s not like in the bag, in the way  that, it sounds like you have this technology and it works today right?
Ash: Yeah.
Dalton: That’s in the bag like you can take that to the bank. I would think  about thinking about what your strengths are and then maybe being open minded to how  you monetize it. It could be until you get this right, until you lock in  this risk that this may not the best possible market for this technology.
Kevin: They call it being promiscuous.
Dalton: Be open minded to ways you can use this. Other people maybe like hey you  don’t need a million receipts we’ll give you money today for this other like semi  related. It could be really close to what you are doing or it could be  a little further away we don’t know but you have something really special and you  have how long ago did you talk to Craft?
Ash: We talked to Craft about three weeks ago.
Kevin: Great. Then is the deal closed with the half a million?
Shay: No we are in relative early conversations but they’ve-
Dalton: With Craft.
Shay: With Craft that’s with Craft.
Kevin: I got you. Make the deal close with the app developer.
Shay: Yes the deal is closed with the app developer.
Kevin: Do you actually have data for half a million receipts?
Shay: Yes.
Dalton: That’s awesome.
Kevin: OK you should go immediately back to Craft is like we currently have-
Dalton: Let’s do a pilot.
Kevin: Half a million-
Dalton: Just work with them.
Kevin: Would you be interested in doing like a pilot, sign a letter of intent say  like start looking at the data we provided to you, you guys can check to  see if like is this what you are looking for, because that will help you  know that you are delivering something on time. Then like have them sign a letter  of … Letter of intent all that’s going to say is just going to say  okay. Then if we, you are going to initially look at this data and tell,  we’ll work back and forth to see is this what you are looking for. This  is the going to be format you want. Then when we have a million receipts,  we’ll start talking about pricing.
Dalton: Because like if you can just put numbers on this I would say when a  startup says we’re in discussions with a customer the close rate on that is like  10%.
Kevin: I discount the zero and even-
Dalton: Let’s just say 10, between 0 and 10%, it’s very low. Versus if you get  an LOI then I’d discount that to like 50% maybe even 60.
Kevin: 25%.
Dalton: What's that’s? 25, all right.
Kevin: A 25.
Dalton: I guess I'm more optimistic than Kevin here. Then once you have a signed contract  then obviously it’s 100%. We from our side of the table we’ve seen so many  people that are in discussions with all these great signing deals and we’re like well  can you get it in writing, then they go try to get it in writing  they are like no. That’s such a good test at this stage and it doesn’t  cost you anything.
Shay: Absolutely.
Kevin: The other piece of advice is everything Dalton talked about in terms of like what  you have in the bank in term of what you are good at, another way  of thinking about it is that like that is default for your business. The default  is the technology of the OCR it has to work, and has better than anything  else. You have to do these other thing usually at a startup that is going  to actually determine whether you will grow and be really successful, and that is going  be sales. That is the part that you have to work 10X harder on. This  thing that you are not very good at you actually have to spend ironically a  lot more time on it to make your company better. Yes for the sales you  are going to talk to all the rest of those mobile developers. Try to get  them all in discussion and close them to get the deal. But also you’ve got  Craft going on but also you should talk to as many other CPG companies also  well to see if is there a market beyond these guys. Is it similar sort  of pricing, what do I need to understand, what needs to be delivered because I  actually basing everything that I'm going to give the CPG companies on what Craft has  said. It’s really like by the end it’s like the next like two months it  should be like you have talked to and figured out how to talk to all  the other mobile developers and you have talked to like 50 other CPG companies at  the very least. That almost all your time, it’s almost no programing or coding. It’s  just developing the language for like do I understand what is the process for closing  these deals, which is actually going to make me money we’re out of time, guys  thank you so much.
Dalton: Thank you so much.
Shay: Thank you.
Ash: Thanks.
Dalton: Thanks appreciate it, thank you.
Kevin: Thank you.
Dalton: Hey how is it going? I'm Dalton.
Kevin: Hi I’m Kevin.
Speaker 7: Hi.
Kevin: Hi.
Speaker 7: Cool so we are working on Commaful a place where people share and read short  stories. We’ve found a new format that’s a little bit like a picture book. There  is a little of text on each page then there is a background image that  relates to the text and you tap through to flip through the pages of the  story. People share anything from poetry fiction as well random blog posts about what they  are doing in their daily lives. Currently we get about 100,000 monthly unique and mostly  teenagers currently using this site.
Kevin: How many stories are been created?
Speaker 7: 20,000 have been created total about 1,500 a month.
Dalton: Let’s say I'm of your active users, what format do I consume this in is  this a mobile app is this a website?
Speaker 7: Right now it’s all mobile web.
Dalton: Okay 100% mobile web?
Speaker 7: Yes.
Dalton: What's the breakdown of what devices they’re on?
Speaker 7: It’s about half and half an IOS and Android.
Speaker 8: 60, 40.
Dalton: OK and then what's the geo location of those folks what country are they in?
Speaker 8: It really leans toward IOS in American and the rest of the world are Android  so it’s still 60, 40.
Dalton: Okay so 60% IOS U.S.
Speaker 7: Yes.
Dalton: Then what are the countries that are non-U.S. Out of the U.S.?
Speaker 7: Philippines is a pretty popular one.
Speaker 8: U.K. And India.
Speaker 7: U.K.
Kevin: U.K. India.
Dalton: Then what would be breakdown say of the Philippines on that one, like 10, 20%.
Speaker 7: It’s like 15%.
Dalton: 15 okay.
Kevin: Who are your most popular storyteller?
Speaker 7: So there is a girl in LA and she basically writes like kind of fourth  wall fiction stories and she already had an audience before joining Commaful, she brought a  good chunk of her audience over.
Kevin: Gotcha and what does popular mean does she have like, you guys have a thing  like subscribers?
Speaker 7: Yeah so she has about 700 followers. We have people who have more followers than  her however she gets the most likes on her stories, she gets the most engagement.
Kevin: How often does she publish?
Speaker 7: Probably a couple of times a month.
Kevin: Couple of times a month gotcha.
Dalton: Sorry just I want to really picture it, then when she publishers what is her  … You said there is a few things people can make, what is the thing  that she makes?
Speaker 7: Fiction stories.
Dalton: How long are they usually?
Speaker 7: They take about three minutes to read they are about a 100 words.
Dalton: Cool, would you say there is any similarities between this and some of the apps  that are like taking off right now that are like collaborative fiction? What’ s the  name of one of them, there is like three.
Speaker 7: Hooked tap.
Dalton: Yeah, I’ve seen those, if you squint at it all, does it look like any  of those?
Speaker 7: It’s a very different model, those are built as games, there is a subscription model  built into them, however we have many similar users, so many of the target users  use both or they are conscious about the money they use Commaful. That’s kind of  the similar audience but different play.
Dalton: Do you have enough purchases and do you have anything at all that goes to  that?
Speaker 7: Currently no.
Dalton: Got it.  Or without a case like that. I’m just trying to think of how those companies  work okay.
Kevin: Do you see this as… What’s the big version of this, what’s the metaphor that  you think of?
Speaker 7: Metaphor wise we see this as kind of how these teens interact with the written  word, you see Instagram and Snapchat as these very visual creatures, very short form types  of content. However, the written word really hasn’t seen much change. As a results a  lot of the stories that you can only through the written word that you can’t  tell through a Snapchat or on Instagram kind of get lost. For us we want  to be the bridge for this new generation to the written word and those types  of stories.
Speaker 8: These stories are permanent, they exist in a space.
Dalton: Are there some stories from a year ago that are still super popular as per  the permanent question?
Speaker 8: Yeah.
Speaker 7: They still get hits, I wouldn’t say they blow up or they get a consistent  huge amounts of traffic but it shows up on search sometimes, sometimes it still resurfaces  in sharing in Twitter.
Dalton: Do you have a sense of what percentage of your readers come from SCO?
Speaker 7: Very few, we get 700 clicks I think per month.
Dalton: What are the most consistent sources of traffic, like when you said it’s the authors  who promote it, so they post it to Twitter and Facebook and then that drives  traffic?
Speaker 7: It pretty much all.
Kevin: This is what success looks like to me in this sort of space. It really  comes down to, is you’ve build a platform that allows people to get things. That’s  pretty much it.
Speaker 7: Yes it is.
Kevin: I think there is like three drivers of like desires by most people and it’s  like money , sex and then power or influence.
Speaker 7: Yeah that makes sense.
Kevin: I don’t know if it’s only three.
Speaker 7: Right three, someone taught me.
Kevin: That influence the biggest things, so does your platform allow people to get really popular,  do they generate stuff that lots of people want to see? Until you hit that,  the thing is dead in the water. This really it’s like what do I do  to bring and on board the very best story tellers, very best people. Ideally it’s  like you guys are constantly generating these service and they have to be really great.  But also it’s like hopefully your community is generating stuff and then are you able  to promote them better, that they can even promote themselves. Something has to happen there  and that’s your only goal, you can try to monetize et cetera but I think  it really comes down to is this a platform where it’s like, if I use  this it’s like or I want to tell stories on here because people actually read  or experience them. It’s like from what you saw from the medium the whole thing  is like what to do next? I don’t know that becomes really the hard part.  Sometimes you end up raising a bunch of money and doesn’t work out, but the  whole thing you have to at least get to the point where like it’s a  platform that gets people really popular. Everything has to do with looking at what is  somewhat popular and saying how do I multiply that, how do I replicate that? Is  there a portion of that where people see theirs and they start making for themselves.  It’s like I would go and just figure out how do I get let me  see here … The best story I heard from within the YC community was twitch.  The long stream platform and what they try to do was like, some people already  streaming, gaming on YouTube. They contacted all the top streamers on there and said like  what do we have to do to get you come to our platform? They did  whatever they wanted because they knew it’s a power locker for content. Only a handful  of people are going to be the most popular. That gives you the best headstart,  so they build whatever features, super nice etcetera. Where are the very best story tellers  for your sort of format? I would think it’s creative people who have been really  good on Snapchat or Instagram or whatever and say and say look you want more  than this, we can offer this to you and you have to figure out what  do they most want, then build those sort of features. Have you started doing that?
Speaker 7: Yes, so the last while we know a lot of top creators and that are  able.
Kevin: What does a top creator look like?
Speaker 7: Someone who has 10,000, 50,000, 100,000
Kevin: No, I want you to go find people that are the top ones.
Speaker 7: I see.
Kevin: You have to talk to them and figure out what would it actually pay.
Speaker 7: The best out there is the million followers plus.
Dalton: Could you just pulling people off Tumblr, because Tumblr is-
Speaker 7: That’s actually most of our traffics. When we say social both our traffic like 80%  is from Tumblr.
Dalton: Okay because Tumblr Yahoo is not really taking care of and I imagine you can  pull the top Tumblr people right?
Speaker 7: Yeah, so we are actually are friends with almost all the top Tumblr creators. What  we’ve been thinking about is critical mass and we think that there is a certain  points that we want to spike everything with all of the users coming together as  one, where you hit this critical mass point and theoretically
Kevin: I would not even think of it like that, that’s too completed. Mostly it’s just  like all the popular kids and I’m just going to systematically talk to all of  them.
Speaker 7: Just land grab get as many-
Kevin: As many as you can and because what you’re looking for is inspiration and you  don’t know what it’s going to be. You don’t know who is going to be  the one that makes a part from take off, you don’t know what this piece  that they are going to make. You need a lot of lightening striking, that’s hopefully  like people go like holy crap what’s this new platform.
Dalton: I agree with that I mean like … I think that founders that are working  on a consumer internet stuff under count how many social things get to your skill  and then top out. They think everyone knows the story of Snapchat and Facebook and  they know about things like that but men even back in the day, there were  a lot of Facebook competitors like hundreds. A lot of them had millions of users.
Speaker 7: Right.
Dalton: Tens of millions or users.
Speaker 7: it’s not meaningful.
Dalton: The thing that’s tricky about consumer internet if we are not going to monetize by  charging our users is the only way you can ever bull an ad business as  you need hundreds of millions. I think in your … Think about Tumblr itself, they  had trouble with their ad business but remember they were the winner for every Tumblr,  they were like ten other little blogs sites, which it’s sounds like you guys are  experts. You remember them?
Speaker 7: Right.
Dalton: They were other want to be Tumblr that had even LiveJournal itself. LiveJournal was original  Tumblr. The point I’m making is like really Kevin, if you’re going to do this  kind of business, you usually want it to grow as fast as you can and  get those economies of scale otherwise you can get stuck in the hundred thousand to  million user range and then top out and then what? I know the founders of  a lot of those types of ones and those are rough, right.
Kevin: Yeah. I feel like you want both a bunch of users and then a bunch  of different stories. Again be what are the top things that people have done on  Tumblr, recreating it on your platform. Like top tweet stories, that’s like series like small  pieces of text and then read, tell them on your platform.
Dalton: That’s probably a twitch thing, just ask them what would it take for you to  move everything over from Tumblr? What features do we need to build for you to  take everything from your Tumblr over here and then put up an audio Tumblr blog  post and then point to your site. If you just didn’t that systematically, that was  the twitch play book. Hang out word, I think now is the time to raid  the Tumblr users.
Speaker 8: One of the most popular things we have it’s a so people take content from  Tumblr and then post on Commaful and we have an export function, every social site  has a different preferred format. On Tumblr we export as photo site. If you're sharing  Tumblr it automatically generates photo sites that’s pretty … It fits on Tumblr. Facebook is  different, Twitter is different.
Kevin: You should also look at all the people making the little stories on medium too,  still on them as well.
Speaker 8: Those are incredible stories too.
Kevin: The whole thing is like figure out, talk to the top story tellers, talk to  the top people who are on all those different platforms, figure out what it’s going  to take to bring them over or start moving some of that stuff over automatically  and just showing it off to the community and seeing what steps what people really  like, what goes around.
Dalton: Because like consumer is different. I think a lot of times people out of in  the audience world, they hear these consumer things, which is just get big, get big  and that is what we’re telling you. But just for everyone else in the audience  that’s the case if you’re doing like B2B. This is not like once size fits  all advice but if you’re going to … Hey you’re launched you’re doing consumer internet  you have a 100,000 MAU, you made it this far, you’ve got to power through  here. Or else if you end up stalling out, then what? You don’t have enough  users to really monetize and we’ve just seen a lot of people stall out of  this stage. In your case yeah you got to go grow.
Speaker 8: We are in the problem solving position here.
Kevin: Yeah. You need to generate whatever it takes to get people the world of mouth  about your thing is like oh, if I’m a really good creator I tell those  stories on this platform, I can get really big.
Dalton: One of the piece of tactical advice, I would look at SCO. Usually like the  way you get really huge I built a consumer site I got it up to  25 Million MAU and SCO was a big part of that, the way you do  something like Quora where you get hundreds of millions of MAU is SCO. I would  try to start tracking it.
Speaker 7: We find that embedding helps us get back links and help us rank some of  those stories that normally wouldn’t write.
Speaker 8: We pushing SCO currently right now yeah.
Dalton: Okay, good that’s the sort of thing it doesn’t cost you anything and that will  just get the flywheel spinning for you to hit that escape velocity. Five minutes.
Kevin: Any questions for us?
Speaker 7: I think the biggest challenge for us obviously is getting from our 100,000 10 Million,  like that’s the next big phase. You’ve already kind of gone over different strategies, I’m  curious what other companies that you’ve seen throw going through YC who have successfully gone  from that 100,000 to millions.
Kevin: It’s still parallel, it’s always parallel for those kind of communities. The top ones bring  almost all the traffic. Which is why I’m saying like everything you have to do  is how do I bring on celebrities onto the platform or return people in this-
Dalton: Well, in along those lines here is the pitfall, don’t pay them. I’ve seen people  try that, that is not … Paying for traffic when you don’t have revenue is  like-
Kevin: They need to love.
Speaker 7: Once you pay them they also expect to be paid in order to make something.
Dalton: That is exactly right, as far as … My understanding is Instagram never paid anyone,  Snapchat never paid anyone, all their clones sure did right but that’s … you know  what I’m saying?
Speaker 7: Yes got it.
Dalton: YouTube wasn’t really paying for traffic but all of the wannabe YouTube that were trying  to raise for money, were paying for traffic. Whatever you try don’t just take what  he’s saying and be like yeah we are just going to pay some celebrities and-
Speaker 7: Right:
Kevin: It’s not a cost effective way of growing.
Dalton: Yeah. I think if you have the dev cycle I don’t know if you do,  but I would consider a mobile app, one advantage from a retention perspective is that  you can do push notifications and that way if someone is subscribing to something and  you do pushed notification to their followers, then you’re ensuring a much, a tighter feedback  loop that maybe you have now on mobile web. What are you doing with the  email Joe?
Speaker 7: Because they’re teams email has been pretty tricky in terms of getting high response rates,  we try messenger bots, so we get some decent response right there, still nothing huge  or significant.
Dalton: I want to keep explaining one of those, again you’re asking what have people done?  You have to reach out and touch people for them to not forget the thing  exist. Think about like there is a million apps out there, everything is competing for  attention and if you think about tools like Facebook it’s basically a weaponized attention grabber.  They have thousands of people working on making sure that you’re constantly looking back at  it. Very smart people that’s all they do all day, it’s try to like steal  your attention and you’re competing with them for attention.
Speaker 7: Exactly:
Dalton: I think just doing some really basic stuff, like continuing to write on email, if  chat is the right thing to do, make sure people remember you exist and that  they are a member of your community and that they should go check out some  new stories otherwise it’s going to be tricky. One experiment you can do I’ve heard  someone give this talk before is go create a Facebook account with like a fake  email and don’t add any friends and look at how emails they’ve sent you.
Speaker 8: I’ve done that actually.
Dalton: I think it sends you like 50 I’m exaggerating.
Speaker 8: .
Dalton: But the point is they realize that if you don’t add any friends that you’re  going to have a bad time and that you’re useless to them and so they  are very aggressive about emailing people. They know they’ve churned you. Anyway if you have  users that you know are going to churn or way past churning just remind them  that you exist. That’s best practices too.
Speaker 7: Right make sense.
Kevin: Guys thank you so much.
Speaker 8: Thank you.
Dalton: Thank you, I appreciate it.
Kevin: Thanks a lot.
Dalton: OK cool, well I think that’s it for us.
