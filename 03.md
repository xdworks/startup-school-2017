# How to Get Ideas and How to Measure - Stewart Butterfield & Adam D'Angelo

Sam Altman: All right. Good afternoon. Today we have two different speakers. We have Stewart, the founder  and CEO of Slack and then we have Adam, the founder and CEO of Quora.  I'm going to interview Stewart. We're gonna talk about ideas and how to find good  ones and then Adam is going to talk about metrics, why they're important and what  to measure. Stewart, thank you for coming and spending some time with us. Stewart is  the found of Flickr and Slack, and what I didn't know until very recently is  that he tried to be the founder twice of Massively Multiplayer Online Games and they  turned into these two iconic companies. So I wanted to talk about just the process  of coming up with the idea for the game and then the ideas for Flickr  and Slack.

山姆·阿尔特曼：好的。下午好今天我们有两位不同的发言者。我们有斯图尔特，斯拉克的创始人和首席执行官，还有亚当，Quora的创始人和首席执行官。我要去采访斯图尔特。我们将讨论想法和如何找到好的想法，然后Adam将讨论度量，为什么它们是重要的，以及如何衡量。斯图尔特，谢谢你来陪我们。斯图尔特是Flickr和Sack的创始人，直到最近我才知道他曾两次尝试成为大型多人在线游戏的创始人，然后他们变成了这两家标志性的公司。所以我想谈谈这个游戏的想法，然后是Flickr和Sack的想法。

Stewart B.: All right. So, yes, twice we set out trying to build a web-based massively multiplayer  game and the origin of that was all the way back in 1992, I arrived  at college and I got my account on the school's Unix machine and was exposed  to the internet for the first time and it was kind of mind blowing experience.  This is about a year before the web became popular, so it was IRC, NewsNet,  Talk, email and I was really fascinated with the idea that people could find their  community, irrespective of what that community was.

斯图尔特B：好吧。所以，是的，我们两次尝试建立一个基于网络的大规模多人游戏，而这个游戏的起源早在1992年，我到了大学，在学校的unix机器上获得了我的账户，第一次接触到了互联网，这是一种令人震惊的体验。大约一年后，网络才流行起来，所以IRC、NewsNet、Talk、Email和我都非常着迷于这样的想法：人们可以找到自己的社区，而不管这个社区是什么。

If you were a breast cancer survivor or  model train enthusiast or whatever, if you're interested in some, as I was, obscure 19th  century biologists, then you can find all that stuff. And the idea of a game  that lived online like that and had the game-like aspects or play as a pretext  for social interaction seemed really interesting.

如果你是乳腺癌幸存者或者火车模特爱好者，或者其他什么的，如果你像我一样，对19世纪一些不知名的生物学家感兴趣，那么你就能找到所有的东西。像这样生活在网络上的游戏，有类似游戏的方面，或者玩游戏作为社交活动的借口，这个想法看起来真的很有趣。

I'm not going to go into too long of  an explanation, because it turns out it's actually like a terrible, terrible idea and ...  At least as a commercial business.

我不会说太长时间的解释，因为它实际上是一个可怕的，可怕的想法和.至少作为一家商业公司。

It might have been fun as a hobby.

作为一种爱好也许会很有趣。

I  think it could have been the kind of business that sustained the number of employees  required to operate it, like a restaurant or something like that, but, when in 2009  we started a company that ended up making Slack, we raised $17.5 million in venture  capital and it was never going to become the kind of business that would justify  that investment. The first time was a little bit different. 2002 was after the dotcom  crash, it was after Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals, it was after 9/11 and the  NASDAQ was down 80%, S&P500 was down 65% from its peak. No one wanted to  invest in internet facing stuff, so it was very hard to tell whether this was  a good idea or not, because there's no signal from the market that said, "This  is an investible idea," because nothing was investible at that time. We raised a little  bit of friends and family money, we spent about a year or so building a  prototype. The prototype was well received, but it was going to take us another year  and a half to finish it and we literally couldn't raise any money at all.  We got to the point where the one person on the team who had kids  was the only person who was getting paid and then we decided to try to  find something else we could do that would make use of the technology that we'd  already developed, but that would be quicker to get to market. And that thing was  Flickr, but it was also a bad idea at first. Because we had developed this  game client and we had a messaging server on the backend, we just repurposed the  game client as a photo sharing client.

我认为这可能是一种能够维持运营该公司所需员工数量的业务，比如一家餐厅或类似的业务，但2009年我们创办了一家公司，最终制造了Sack，我们筹集了1，750万美元的风险投资，但它永远不会成为值得投资的那种业务。第一次有点不同。2002年是互联网崩溃后，世通(Worldcom)和安然(Enron)会计丑闻之后，9·11事件之后，纳斯达克指数(NASDAQ)下跌80%，标普500指数(S&P 500)较峰值下跌65%。没有人想投资于面向互联网的东西，所以很难判断这是否是一个好主意，因为市场没有信号说，“这是一个可投资的想法”，因为当时没有什么是可投资的。我们筹集了一些朋友和家人的钱，我们花了大约一年左右的时间来建造一个原型。原型很受欢迎，但是我们需要一年半的时间才能完成它，我们根本无法筹集到任何资金。我们达到了这样的程度：团队中唯一一个有孩子的人是唯一能拿到工资的人，然后我们决定找一些我们可以做的事情，利用我们已经开发出来的技术，但这样才能更快地进入市场。那东西是Flickr，但一开始也是个坏主意。因为我们开发了这个游戏客户端，并且在后端有一个消息服务器，所以我们只是将游戏客户端重新定位为一个照片共享客户端。

In the game, you had a bunch of  slots along the bottom of the screen for inventory. Those became slots into which you  could fit photos. And because the game was all realtime interaction, the photo sharing was  all realtime interaction. Which meant that you had to be online at the same time  as someone you cared about in order to use it and while it demoed really  well, it was amazing technology especially for at the time we started on that, maybe  late 2003, it was a terrible product because you didn't care about any of the  people who were actually online. That morphed really quickly and the experience making Slack was  a little bit different. We had all of the resources we could ever ask for.  We had more than enough money because we had money left over. We decided to  abandon the idea and we had AWS, which we didn't have before, hardware was effectively  free, internet connections were much better, there were many more people online, hardware was better.  None of those external conditions was the reason this wasn't as Massively Multiplayer Game on  the web wasn't a good idea.

在游戏中，你在屏幕的底部有一堆槽来储存存货。这些成为你可以放照片的插槽。因为游戏都是实时互动的，所以照片分享都是实时互动。这意味着你必须和你关心的人同时在线，这样你才能使用它。虽然它展示得很好，但这是一项令人惊叹的技术，尤其是在我们开始的时候，也许在2003年末，它是一个糟糕的产品，因为你根本不关心任何一个真正在线的人。这种情况很快就发生了变化，而制作斯拉克的经历也有一点不同。我们拥有我们所能要求的所有资源。我们有足够的钱，因为我们有剩余的钱。我们决定放弃这个想法，我们有了AWS，这是我们以前没有的，硬件实际上是免费的，互联网连接要好得多，网上有更多的人，硬件更好。这些外部条件都不是为什么网络上的大规模多人游戏不是一个好主意的原因。

It was just not a good idea because there  wasn't a big enough market for it.

这不是一个好主意，因为它没有足够大的市场。

Sam Altman: And why was Slack a good idea? How did you decide that Slack was looking  to build?
Stewart B.: Well, we started developing the system for internal communication that was based on IRC. And  those of you who had used IRC and also use Slack can recognize that Slack  is IRC with all of the things that were missing when it was originally designed  in 1989.

山姆·阿尔特曼：为什么斯拉克是个好主意？你是怎么决定斯拉克想建造的？斯图尔特B.：嗯，我们开始开发基于IRC的内部交流系统。你们中那些曾经使用过IRC的人，也使用过Sack的人都能认识到，Sack是IRC，在它最初设计于1989年的时候，它所缺少的所有东西都是IRC的。

I think, this is post facto analysis so it's hard to know if  this really true or not, but I think that the reason that Slack has been  so successful is because we had a three and a half year long design process  where we weren't conscious that we were designing it. So, we started using IRC.

我认为，这是事后的分析，所以很难确定这是否真的是真的，但我认为，斯莱克之所以如此成功，是因为我们有一个长达三年半的设计过程，我们没有意识到我们在设计它。所以我们开始使用IRC。

IRC  has many deficiencies, among them you can't store and forward messages. So if I wanted  to send you a message and you're not connected to the server at the moment  I want to send it, I just can't send you a message. So the first  thing we built was a bot to log all the messages and put them in  an archive. And once we had that, we had messages in our database and we  thought search would be useful so we built search for it. And this was 2009,  there were no good IRC clients for iPhones and so we built an HTML5 front-end  for the archives in Safari and once we had that, we wanted to be able  to post. And just like on and on and on. But, in the normal process  of software development, there's a huge amount of ego and speculation. So, when you're arguing  with someone whether this feature is a good idea or not, if you can get  to the point of enlightenment and a Buddha sense, then maybe you can do that  without any ego, but the practical reality is people are very ego-latent in those discussions  and there's a lot of speculation. Like, "I think this could be really valuable for  someone," whereas when we were building a system that was kind of the proto-Slack that  was the inspiration for Slack, it was whatever problem is the most irritating, like something  that we just absolutely can't stand, we would address that with a minimum amount of  effort and then go back to what we're supposed to be doing and that kind  of let it cook for several months and we had 45 people working on it,  working on the game, so we had a lot of real world feedback. Or when  there was a problem or an opportunity that was so obvious that we couldn't help  but take advantage of it, we would spend a minimum number of minutes on that  and go back to it. So at the end of that process we had this  fully designed product that we were using that was terrible implementation, not what you would  do if you started from scratch, but it was obvious that this was something that  had enormous value. Everyone who worked at the company agreed they would never work without  something like this again and so just on that basis, it seemed like it was  a great idea. We had years of evidence.

IRC有许多不足之处，其中您无法存储和转发消息。所以，如果我想给你发一条消息，而你现在还没有连接到服务器上，我就不能给你发消息。所以我们建立的第一件事是一个机器人来记录所有的消息并把它们放在一个存档中。一旦我们有了，我们的数据库中有消息，我们认为搜索是有用的，所以我们建立了它的搜索。而这是2009年，没有好的IRC客户端iPhone，所以我们建立了一个HTML 5前端的档案在Safari，一旦我们有了，我们希望能够张贴。就像一次又一次。但是，在软件开发的正常过程中，存在着大量的自我意识和猜测。所以，当你和别人争论这个特征是不是个好主意的时候，如果你能达到开悟和佛陀的感觉，那么也许你可以在没有自我的情况下做到这一点，但实际的现实是，人们非常自我-在这些讨论中潜藏着自我，还有很多猜测。比如，“我认为这对某个人来说是很有价值的”，而当我们正在建立一个原动力的系统时，无论是什么问题都是最令人恼火的，就像我们完全无法忍受的问题一样，我们会用最少的努力去解决这个问题，然后回到我们应该做的事情上。这样就让它煮了几个月，我们有45个人在做，做游戏，所以我们得到了很多真实世界的反馈。或者，当有一个问题或一个机会是如此明显，我们不得不利用它，我们会花最少的时间，并回到它。因此，在这个过程的最后，我们有了一个完全设计的产品，我们使用的是糟糕的实现，而不是如果你从头开始会做什么，但很明显，这是一个具有巨大价值的东西。每个在该公司工作的人都同意，如果没有这样的事情，他们永远不会工作，因此，在这个基础上，这似乎是一个伟大的想法。我们有多年的证据。

Sam Altman: Were there other things you consider pivoting to or was it just like, "There's the  stand. We're going to do it.

山姆·奥特曼：你是否考虑过其他的事情，比如，“这是证人席，我们要这么做。”

It's working."?
Stewart B.: I wish that I had better access to the proposals that I had personally had  written, because I had a whole bunch of fucking terrible, terrible ideas and this was  the one that had the broadest consensus among the team as being something that would  be valuable. What's interesting at the time, though, so we had $5 million left in  the bank. None of our investors wanted their money back. They wanted to just go  try something else. Jason Horowitz is one of our investors so we went down and  did the partner meeting and kind of presented what our big idea was. And at  that time, this is before we actually started development of Slack, but when we had  this proto version, we said that one day this could be like a hundred million  dollar a year revenue business, so it can be valued at billon dollars on that  basis, and we though that that was a decade out and that would be the  culmination, like that would be, "We have a 100% of the ." We went past  that in year two, kind of blew past it. We'll do $200 million in gap  revenue this year and still be growing at a fast rate. Now we think that  number is more like $10 billion in revenue, like a $100 billion company. We didn't  realize how good of an idea it was, but it's also ... There's an interesting  story about deciding to shut it down. Because we still had money, because we had  a relatively big user base who were very engaged but we had a really a  leaky bucket, it was very difficult to add new users to the game we were  working on, which was called the Glitch, I felt very stuck in this position because  on the one hand you have a narrative of, "Good entrepreneurs are resilient," "When everyone  else thinks it's a bad idea, it's probably a really good idea," "You have to  dig in, prove people wrong," "Keep going even when times are dark." On the other  hand, there was a morning when I woke up and I was just like, "I  can't do this anymore.

起作用了。“？斯图尔特B.：我希望我能更好地获得我自己写过的建议，因为我有一大堆糟糕的、糟糕的想法，而这是团队中最广泛的共识，也是有价值的东西。不过，当时有趣的是，我们银行里还剩下500万美元。我们的投资者都不想要回他们的钱。他们想去试试别的东西。詹森·霍洛维茨是我们的投资者之一，所以我们去做了合伙人会议，提出了我们的伟大想法。当时，这是在我们真正开始开发斯拉克之前，但是当我们有了这个Proto版本的时候，我们说有一天这可能是每年1亿美元的收入业务，所以在这个基础上，它的价值可以达到10亿美元，而我们认为那已经过去了十年了，这将是一个顶点，就像这样。会是，“我们有百分之百的。”我们在第二年就过去了，有点被吹过去了。我们今年的缺口收入将达到2亿美元，而且仍在快速增长。现在我们认为这个数字更像是100亿美元的收入，就像一家1000亿美元的公司。我们没有意识到这个主意有多好，但它也.有一个有趣的故事决定关闭它。因为我们还有钱，因为我们有一个相对庞大的用户群，他们非常投入，但是我们有一个非常漏桶，很难在我们正在开发的游戏中增加新的用户，这就是所谓的故障，我觉得被困在这个位置上是因为一方面你有这样的叙述：“优秀的企业家是有弹性的，“当其他人都认为这是个坏主意时，这可能是个很好的主意，”你必须深入研究，证明人们是错的“，”即使在天黑的时候也要继续前进。“另一方面，有一天早上我醒来的时候，我就想，“我不能再这样下去了。”

I'm the CEO, I'm the chairman of the board.

我是首席执行官，我是董事会主席。

I'm sure  that this is not going to work." And it's actually hard to convince everyone else.

我相信这是行不通的。“事实上，要说服其他人是很困难的。

Sam Altman: I think that's one of the hardest things about evaluating ideas, is saying, "Well, this  one is not going to work." So, do you remember what it was about that  morning when you woke up and said, "You know what? It's time to move on."?
Stewart B.: I think people have very little introspective access to their own cognitive processes to begin  with, so anything they say would be kind of making it up, but I think  it was, I had exhausted all of the ideas we had to fix the problems,  so we focused on new user experience and we really wanted to teach people what  this was and what the possibilities were and get them excited about it. Because we  were okay at attracting people onto the top of the funnel, but had a hard  time retaining them. And-
Sam Altman: That's always when I tell people to give up an idea. When you're out of  ideas about how to make this work.

山姆·奥特曼：我认为这是评估想法最难的事情之一，就是说，“好吧，这个不管用。”所以，你还记得那天早上你醒来的时候说：“你知道吗？是时候向前看了？”斯图尔特B.：我认为人们一开始对自己的认知过程几乎没有自省的机会，所以他们所说的一切都是编造出来的，但我认为，我已经用尽了所有我们必须解决问题的想法，所以我们专注于新的用户体验，我们真的想教人们这是什么和什么。这些可能性让他们兴奋起来。因为我们可以把人吸引到漏斗的顶端，但很难留住他们。山姆·奥特曼：我总是告诉人们放弃一个想法。当你想不出该怎么做的时候。

Stewart B.: Yeah, exactly. So we would have an idea, we try it, didn't work. Have another  idea and then like ... At first, you can fill up posted notes, those giant  boards, you can fill up whiteboards with ideas and you argue about which ones are  the highest value and then one by one you kind of eliminate them. Months go  by, a year goes by, another six months goes by and it's like, "Shit. These  were all of the ideas that we thought were the worst ones to begin with  and we only have three left. So this is probably not going to work."
Sam Altman: You mentioned at one point you had a bunch of proposals. How do you come  up with ideas, or how did you even think that Slack is maybe this thing  is really good idea? How do you come up with new ideas and how do  you evaluate them?
Stewart B.: Coming up with new ideas is easy.

是的，没错。所以我们会有一个想法，我们尝试，但没有成功。有另一个主意然后就像.。一开始，你可以填写贴出的笔记，那些巨大的板，你可以用想法填充白板，你可以争论哪些是最高的价值，然后一个地消除它们。几个月过去了，一年过去了，六个月过去了，就像“妈的。这些都是我们认为最糟糕的想法，我们只剩下三个了。所以这可能行不通。”山姆·阿尔特曼：你曾经提过一堆建议。你是怎么想出点子的，或者你是怎么认为斯拉克也许这是个好主意的？你如何想出新的想法，如何评价它们？想出新的想法很容易。

I feel like it's hard almost to not  come up with ideas. They're not necessarily good, I guess, so the recognition of which  ones are good is actually much harder.

我觉得很难不想出主意。他们不一定是好的，我想，所以，识别哪些是好的，实际上要困难得多。

I recently finally got around to reading Thinking,  Fast and Slow and there's this story there of a psychologist named Herbert Simon who  studied in Chess Grandmasters. Because Chess Grandmasters are one of the category of people, like  really experienced doctors, who people regard as being kind of miraculous in their ability to  intuit a situation, like glance at a board and say, "White checkmate in three moves."  And people thought that this was some super well developed intuition. And professor Simon argues  that it's just a recognition in the same way that a 18 month year old  can look at a dog and say, "Doggie." Or within the first 500 milliseconds of  someone speaking, you can tell if they're angry at you. You just develop the ability  to recognize situations and cues which are hard to disambiguate, that are hard to articulate  and enumerate in your mind and say exactly why you think this way, but over  time you get better and better at doing it.

我最近终于读到了思考，快和慢，有一个心理学家赫伯特·西蒙的故事，他在国际象棋大师学院学习。因为国际象棋大师是一类人，就像真正有经验的医生一样，人们认为他们的直觉能力是一种奇迹，就像扫一眼棋盘，说“三步白死”。人们认为这是一种高度发达的直觉。西蒙教授认为，这只是一种认可，就像一个18个月大的孩子看着一只狗说“狗”一样。或者，在说话的前500毫秒内，你可以看出他们是否对你生气。你只需要培养一种能力，去识别那些很难消除歧义的情况和线索，在你的脑海中很难表达和列举出来，并确切地说出你为什么这样想，但随着时间的推移，你做的越来越好了。

I've been making software professionally for  about 20 years, so the specific micro ideas or sub ideas about feature implementation or  the order of actions and the user experience, or whether a certain feature is more  important than another feature, those ones I feel like I have an intuitive sense, which  is actually just the ability to recognize over time.

我从事软件专业制作已经有20年了，所以关于功能实现、操作顺序和用户体验的具体的微观想法或子想法，或者某个特性是否比另一个特性更重要，那些我觉得我有直觉的特性，实际上就是随着时间的推移能够识别的能力。

It's really a process of filtering.  You just have constant ideas, everyone has ideas. We at Slack have developed a lot  of organizational design and practices to try to absorb as many as we can. We  get about somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 tweets at us a month and all of  those are responded to by an actual human being. We get a similar number of  customer support tickets and we have processes for trying to filter up and abstract all  of the feedback that we're getting. But even down to the level of all of  the tweets at Slack the company are pumped into our Slack instance and people check  them and they can add an emoji reaction and that filters into another channel for  the ones that seem above some threshold of, "This seems like a good idea and  it also seems practical.

这真的是一个过滤的过程。你只有不断的想法，每个人都有想法。我们在斯拉克开发了大量的组织设计和实践，试图吸收尽可能多的组织设计和实践。我们每个月在我们这里发10，000到20，000条推特，所有这些都是由一个真正的人来回复的。我们得到了类似数量的客户支持票，我们有程序试图过滤和抽象我们得到的所有反馈。但是，即使是在斯拉克的所有推文的水平上，公司都被注入到我们的Sack实例中，人们会检查它们，他们可以添加一个表情符号反应，然后过滤到似乎超过某个阈值的另一个通道中，“这似乎是一个好主意，也似乎是切实可行的。

I could imagine that we could do it." And then there's  some debate at that level, but every ... Because almost every person I know in  the technology industry also uses Slack, any time I talk to any of them they  have ideas for me.

我可以想象，我们可以做到这一点。“然后在这个层面上有一些争论，但是每一个.因为几乎每个我认识的科技行业的人都使用斯拉克，每当我和他们中的任何人交谈时，他们都有我的想法。

I mean, they have complaints or proposals.

我是说，他们有抱怨或建议。

Sam Altman: The little ideas I get the intuition on. What about the big idea? Did you  spend a lot of time thinking before you decided to go ahead with Slack? Did  you spend a lot of time thinking about, "This would be really strategically valuable and  there'd be a deep network effect."?
Stewart B.: No, not at all. We thought that this would be valuable for individual teams and  we could see that value demonstrated in our own experience. We definitely didn't see how  applicable it would be, like how many, because by now we have 38,000 paid customers  around the world. That's a lot. We have a sales team, but we've never talked  to 90% plus of our customers because we just couldn't talk to that many people.  Again, this is already further than I thought we would get at the very end.  So we under-recognized it. Those big idea are, I don't know. We talked briefly about  this topic before and one of my favorite lines is, "I have a great idea  for a novel. All I need is for someone to write it for me." Which  is obviously preposterous, right? No one would really think, I mean only a very deluded  person would think that that's true, but people definitely have ideas for apps all the  time and those can be harder to assess and it's so rare that I hear  one where someone proposes an idea where it just, "Prima facie, that is a good  idea," as opposed to, "I don't know.

山姆·奥特曼：我有直觉的那些小想法。那个大主意呢？你是否花了很多时间思考，然后你决定继续与斯拉克？你是否花了很多时间思考，“这将是真正有战略价值的，并且会产生深刻的网络效应？”斯图尔特B：不，一点也不。我们认为这对个别球队来说是很有价值的，我们可以从我们自己的经验中看到这种价值。我们肯定没有看到它会有多适用，比如有多少，因为到目前为止，我们在世界各地有38，000名付费客户。太多了。我们有一个销售团队，但我们从未与超过90%的客户进行过交谈，因为我们无法与那么多人交谈。再说一次，这已经比我想象的更远了。所以我们没意识到。那些大主意是，我不知道。我们之前曾简短地谈论过这个话题，我最喜欢的一句话是：“我对一部小说有一个好主意，我所需要的就是有人为我写它。”这显然是荒谬的，对吧？没有人会真的认为，我的意思是只有一个非常受骗的人才会认为这是真的，但人们肯定一直都有应用程序的想法，而且这些想法很难评估，而且我很少听到有人提出这样的想法，“初步看来，这是个好主意”，而不是“我不知道”。

It really depends on the execution." Actually, just  last night I was watching something on YouTube and the ad that came up before  was for an app called MileIQ and it's ... You turn it on, asks for  location permissions and then every time you go on a car ride, it just looks  to see the speed that you're traveling and then at the point you stop, it  stops it. Kind of like an automatic Strava, it just records all your trips and  then you can swipe right to say that, "This is a trip that my company  is supposed to reimburse me for, so I've left ... " Anyway, it's a very  simple idea.

这要看执行情况而定。“实际上，就在昨晚，我在YouTube上看了些东西，之前的广告是为了一个叫MileIQ的应用程序，它是.你打开它，请求位置许可，然后每次你开车的时候，它只是看你旅行的速度，然后在你停下来的时候，它就停止了。有点像一个自动的Strava，它只记录你所有的旅行，然后你可以正确地说，“这是我的公司应该补偿我的一次旅行，所以我离开了.“不管怎么说，这是个很简单的主意。

It's actually a really great idea because people have trouble recording those, they  have trouble in audits with the IRS to prove that they used the car for  this purpose, and stuff like that. And that's one that actually seems like, "Hmm." The  application doesn't seem very difficult.

这实际上是一个非常好的主意，因为人们很难记录这些信息，他们在与国税局的审计中遇到了困难，以证明他们使用这辆车是为了这个目的，诸如此类的事情。这看起来就像是，“嗯。”应用程序似乎不太困难。

I think that would be a good idea.

我觉得这是个好主意。

If you  could market it affectively, it'll probably be a successful business." But 95% of the ideas  I hear, I have no idea whether it'd be successful.

如果你能充满感情地推销它，它可能是一项成功的生意。“但是我听到的95%的想法，我不知道它是否会成功。

Sam Altman: Where are you generally on the spectrum of, "Ideas matter and it's worth the effort  to think of a good one." And, "It's just all about execution and ideas don't  matter at all. You just have to keep trying things until someday one of your  internal tools turns into Slack."?
Stewart B.: There's a lot of people in this class and then there's a lot of people  at Stanford and there's a lot of people in South Bay, there's a lot of  people in the Bay area and many, many people want to start tech companies and  all hope to be successful. To a certain extent, there's a 100 million monkeys banging  on a typewriter and someone's going to start a Shakespeare sonnet. There is a little  bit of that, like a little bit of bias and other cognitive biases that come  into play. On the other hand, I don't think either end of those spectrum is  right.

山姆·奥特曼：“思想很重要，想出一个好主意是值得的。”而且，“一切都是关于执行的，想法根本不重要。你只需要不断尝试，直到有一天你的内部工具变成了斯拉克？”斯图尔特·B：这个班有很多人，斯坦福大学也有很多人，南湾有很多人，湾区有很多人，很多人想创办科技公司，所有人都希望成功。在某种程度上，有一亿只猴子在敲打字机，有人要开始写莎士比亚的十四行诗了。有一点是这样的，比如一些偏见和其他认知上的偏见在起作用。另一方面，我不认为这两种情况都是正确的。

I would definitely lean more towards execution. There's a good Steve Jobs elaboration of,  John Sculley got hired and started hiring all these people at Apple who thought that  only the ideas matter. The idea absolutely matters, but the idea when you start hating  execution has to accommodate so many things.

我肯定会更倾向于执行死刑。有一个很好的史蒂夫乔布斯的阐述，约翰斯卡利被录用，并开始雇用所有这些人在苹果，谁认为只有想法重要。这个想法绝对重要，但是当你开始憎恨执行的时候，这个想法必须适应这么多的事情。

In Steve Jobs' case it's about what it's  possible to get glass to do and how small you can make batteries and what  kind of tencel shrink the plastics have and stuff like that, because your idea has  to stand up to all these things and it'll transmogrify and alter and may even  be unrecognizable in the end, but if you're really good at execution then the core  of the idea can make it through all those steps.

就史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)的情况而言，它是关于玻璃可以做什么，你可以制造出多小的电池，塑料有什么样的收缩，以及诸如此类的东西，因为你的想法必须经得起所有这些事情的考验，它最终可能会变形和改变，甚至可能是无法识别的，但如果你真的很擅长执行，那么你的想法就会被接受。这个想法的核心可以通过所有这些步骤。

I absolutely favor execution, but  you can execute a lot on a terrible idea and then not get anywhere. So  you kind of need both.

我绝对赞成执行，但你可以在一个糟糕的主意上执行很多，然后什么也得不到。所以你需要两者兼而有之。

Sam Altman: If you were starting a new company today, April 2017, where would you look for  ideas? What sorts of things would be thinking about?
Stewart B.: I don't know if this works for other people, but I would definitely look at  my own experiences as a consumer, generally, because it's really easy for me to see  things that are frustrating.

山姆·奥特曼：如果你今天，2017年4月创办一家新公司，你会在哪里寻找新的想法？会想些什么呢？斯图尔特B.：我不知道这是否适用于其他人，但我肯定会看看自己作为消费者的经历，一般来说，因为我很容易看到令人沮丧的事情。

I complain about stuff a lot, especially given how good my  life is. My life is really good and yet every time I have to fly  somewhere, I have at least 10 significant complaints and 50 minor complaints. And every one  of those is an opportunity. Every one of those things that don't go as well  as you would like are opportunities for improvement and some of those seem like someone  else should see them and it should be really obvious, but they're often not. There's  this story I tell in our internal onboarding process of me and our head of  project design going for a walk in Vancouver. And our office in Vancouver is in  neighborhood that's really narrow, so I'd walk, sidewalks have sandwich boards from vendors out so  it's very crowded, you kind of wind around, and so it starts raining while we're  on this walk and maybe two thirds of people had umbrellas with them and we  didn't and people are walking towards us on the sidewalk and almost no one would  move their umbrella out of the way so that the pocky things wouldn't get us  in the eye. Like I said, the sidewalks were very narrow so we had to  keep on ducking.

我抱怨很多事情，特别是考虑到我的生活是多么美好。我的生活真的很好，但是每次我必须飞到某个地方，我至少有10个重要的抱怨和50个轻微的抱怨。其中的每一个都是一个机会。每一件不像你希望的那样好的事情都是改进的机会，而其中的一些似乎应该是别人应该看到的，这应该是显而易见的，但它们往往是不存在的。在我和我们的项目设计负责人去温哥华散步的内部入职过程中，我讲了一个故事。我们在温哥华的办公室很窄，所以我会走，人行道上有来自小贩的三明治板，所以很拥挤，到处都是风，所以我们散步的时候开始下雨，可能有三分之二的人带着雨伞，我们没有，人们在人行道上朝我们走来，几乎没有人。把他们的雨伞移开，这样口袋里的东西就不会让我们眼花缭乱了。就像我说的，人行道很窄，所以我们不得不继续躲躲闪闪。

I can come up with many explanations for why this would be,  but don't explain with malice that which can be explained by ignorance, so probably it  wasn't just that these people have few avenues for exercising power in their lives and  they were choosing but this moment to exercise some power, but then there's really only  two explanations. One is that they just walk through the world and they don't see  that we're going like this to get away from an umbrella, even though inevitably they  had that experience themselves, or they see that this is happening and they're like, "I  just can't think of anything I can do to ameliorate the situation." Despite the fact  that it's this, it is tiny, like a hundredth of a calorie worth of effort  and a tiny amount of consideration and the point of telling that story is that  that's the way, this is a sad way of looking at the world, but that's  the way that most people go through the world, they're oblivious to the problems that  other people have and if they notice the problems, they're unable to come up with  any kind of solution. Two thirds of the people just didn't tilt their umbrellas, which  means that if you're the kind of person who's willing to tilt your umbrella, there's  a whole world of opportunity out there.

我可以想出很多解释来解释为什么会这样，但不要恶意地解释，这可以用无知来解释，所以，也许这不仅仅是因为这些人在生活中几乎没有行使权力的途径，他们只是选择了这一刻来行使一些权力，但实际上只有两种解释。一是他们只是走遍世界，他们没有看到我们这样做是为了摆脱雨伞，尽管不可避免的是，他们自己也有这样的经历，或者他们看到了正在发生的事情，他们说，“我只是想不出我能做些什么来改善这种情况。”尽管事实是这样，它是很小的，就像百分之一卡路里的努力和一点点的考虑，而讲这个故事的意义就是这样，这是一种看世界的悲哀的方式，但这是大多数人经历这个世界的方式，他们忽略了其他人的问题。如果他们注意到了这些问题，他们就无法找到任何解决办法。三分之二的人没有倾斜雨伞，这意味着，如果你是那种愿意倾斜伞的人，那么世界上就会有很多机会。

Sam Altman: Do you have any tips on how to notice that you should tilt your umbrella?
Stewart B.: Pay attention.

山姆·阿尔特曼：你有什么关于如何注意到你应该把伞倾斜的建议吗？注意听。

I mean, that is the biggest thing. But pay attention especially to other  people. So you can pay attention to your own signals and maybe if you get  practiced-
Sam Altman: This is actually worked in the Y Combinator history when people have needed to come  up with new idea on the fly.

我是说，这是最重要的事。但要特别注意其他人。所以你可以注意你自己的信号，也许如果你练习的话-山姆·奥特曼：这实际上是在Y组合器的历史上工作的，当人们需要想出新的想法的时候。

It doesn't usually work, but when they really  just commit to paying attention to other people and what seems broken that has worked.  And then, so if you do this while you come up with thousands of ideas,  anything you've noticed as a good way to filter those besides just building up the  experience of seeing a lot and the recognition?
Stewart B.: Yeah, there is the kind of dialectic between execution and idea, because there's definitely something  to be said when things are above some threshold of good to sticking with the  same idea. Not so much because that idea is the best one, but because the  wild and neurotic chasing of the next idea when you have something that has a  little bit of traction can be really dangerous. Slack is a good example of that.  We conceived up Slack as a tool for business. We developed it that way, we  priced it that way.

它通常不起作用，但当他们真正致力于关注他人和似乎失败的事情时，这种做法就奏效了。然后，如果你在想出成千上万种想法的时候就这么做了，你注意到的任何东西都是过滤这些想法的好方法，除了积累大量的视觉体验和认知度之外？斯图尔特B：是的，在执行和想法之间有一种辩证法，因为当事情超出了坚持同样的想法的好的临界值时，肯定有话要说。这并不是因为这个想法是最好的，而是因为当你有一些牵引力的东西时，疯狂和神经质地追逐下一个想法是非常危险的。松弛就是一个很好的例子。我们设想斯拉克是一种商业工具。我们是这样发展的，我们用这种方式定价。

It was successful, but there was also this huge amount of  social usage. Like now maybe a third of the Slack teams that get created are  for some kind of social usage and a lot of people had the idea that  we should pursue that, like we should make Slack for groups or even just pivot  to being a consumer company, kind of a private version of Tweeter or something like  that. We've been pretty steadfast in not doing that, because you can only do so  many things well and there's a lot of shiny objects like that that are very  distracting.

这是成功的，但也有大量的社会使用。就像现在，也许有三分之一的团队是为了某种社会用途而创建的，很多人认为我们应该追求这一点，就像我们应该让SlekforGroup，甚至只是转向成为一家消费公司，一种私人版的Tweter或者诸如此类的东西。我们一直很坚定地不这么做，因为你只能做这么多事情，而且有很多闪亮的物体是非常分散注意力的。

Sam Altman: Are you the one that says no to most of those new ideas or have  you had to build that into the company? When something is going as well as  Slack, there's so many new ideas.

山姆·奥特曼：你是那个拒绝大多数新想法的人，还是你必须在公司里建立起这样的想法？当事情进展得和斯拉克一样好的时候，就会有很多新的想法。

Stewart B.: I'm chief-no-sayer, but there's definitely a whole bunch of people who are equally committed to  no.

史都华B：我是“禁赛”局长，但肯定有一大群人同样致力于“不”。

Sam Altman: Great. We can probably take one question for Stewart, if someone has a really good  one, before it's time to go.

山姆·阿尔特曼：太好了。如果有人有一个很好的问题，在该走之前，我们也许可以为Stewart回答一个问题。

Stewart B.: Only a really good one.

斯图尔特B：只有一个非常好的。

Sam Altman: Maybe that was so much pressure .

山姆·阿尔特曼：也许那是太大的压力了。

Speaker 3: So you already had a successful company before Slack.

演讲者3：在斯拉克之前，你已经有了一家成功的公司。

I was wondering what's the differences  between as a first time founder and a second time founder.

我想知道作为第一次创始人和第二次创办人之间有什么区别。

Sam Altman: What are the differences as the second time founder?
Stewart B.: Every one of the external factors was much easier. So the first time, I mentioned,  that we ended up making Flickr because we couldn't raise any money and we were  desperate to try to finish something. Fast forward seven years and we could raise as  much money as we wanted, so that was easy. We didn't even make a .  We just said, "We would like some money," and then people gave us money. A  lot of those things were easier. So it was easier to get press, it was  easier to get attention, easier to recruit, easier to raise money.

山姆·阿尔特曼：作为第二次创始人，有什么不同？斯图尔特B：每一个外部因素都要容易得多。所以，我第一次提到，我们最终赚到了Flickr，因为我们无法筹集到任何资金，我们拼命想要完成一些事情。快进七年，我们就能筹集到我们想要的多少钱，所以这很容易。我们甚至都没做。我们只是说，“我们想要一些钱，”然后人们给了我们钱。很多事情都比较容易。所以更容易得到媒体，更容易得到关注，更容易招募，更容易筹集资金。

It's not any easier  to be successful certainly, because we started the company that made Slack in 2009 and  failed pretty hard for three and a half years, kind of like pushing into the  wind of something that wasn't ultimately going to work. And we could have just stopped  there, right? It was great for our investors that we didn't recap and we just  kept the same company and so that company has now been successful. We could have  also just walked away from the company and incorporated a new company and then it  would have been, "My second company was a failure," instead of, "My second company was  a great pivot." I'm not sure which things get harder.

当然，成功并不容易，因为我们创办了一家公司，在2009年创立了Sack，并在三年半的时间里非常艰难地失败了，就像在一些最终无法奏效的事情的风口浪尖中前进一样。我们本可以就此止步，对吧？这对我们的投资者来说很好，我们没有重述，我们只保留了同一家公司，所以该公司现在已经成功了。我们也可以离开这家公司，成立一家新公司，然后它就会是，“我的第二家公司是一个失败的公司”，而不是“我的第二家公司是一个伟大的枢纽”。我不知道哪件事情会变得更艰难。

I'm not sure that any  do, other than the degree of self-criticism and awareness of your own limitations.

除了自我批评的程度和意识到自己的局限性之外，我不确定有什么可以做到的。

Sam Altman: Great. Thank you very much.

山姆·阿尔特曼：太好了。非常感谢

Stewart B.: No problem.

斯图尔特B：没问题。

Sam Altman: I appreciate you coming in, and now I'll have Adam talk about metrics.

山姆·阿尔特曼：我很感谢你的到来，现在我要让亚当谈谈衡量标准。

Adam D.: Great. Thanks for having me.

亚当·D：太好了。谢谢你邀请我。

I'm happy to be here.

我很高兴能在这里。

I'm going to talk about  metrics and measurement and this whole group of issues that come up as you're trying  to start a company. One of the things I think is really interesting with this  topic is that it's so much of what you have to do in a startup  is specific to the startup. You're going to have to get to be an expert  at some domain, you're going to have to get better than anyone else at that  domain and a lot of what it takes to do that is hard to teach  in a class, because it's just different for every startup. But metrics is this domain  that's kind of general enough to be useful to almost all startups.

我将讨论度量和度量，以及在您试图创建一家公司时出现的所有问题。我认为这个话题非常有趣的一点是，在创业中你需要做的很多事情都是特定于创业公司的。你必须成为某一领域的专家，你必须在这个领域比任何人都更好，而在课堂上要做到这一点是很困难的，因为每个创业公司都不一样。但是，衡量标准是这个领域，它具有足够的通用性，对几乎所有的初创企业都是有用的。

I'm going to  start off with this example. So, this is the first version of amazon.com from the  early '90s and I really like looking at these. You can look at the first  versions of lots of different products.

我将从这个例子开始。所以，这是亚马逊网站90年代初的第一个版本，我非常喜欢看这些，你可以看很多不同产品的第一个版本。

It's a good reminder that it's much easier to  get these things started than you'd think. Even these companies that are massive today, if  you just go and look at how they started, this is a good way to  keep yourself in touch with the reality of how companies get started. Does anyone know  why Amazon decided to start with books?
Speaker 5: Choice.

这是一个很好的提醒，要让这些事情开始比你想象的要容易得多。即使是那些今天规模庞大的公司，如果你去看看它们是如何开始的，这也是一个很好的方式，让你了解公司是如何起步的。有人知道亚马逊为什么决定从书籍开始吗？演讲者5：选择。

Adam D.: Choice? Yeah, yeah. That's actually ...

亚当·D：选择？是的，是的。那实际上是.。

I think what you mean is that you have  a lot of ... You get to choose from a lot of different books? Yeah,  yeah. So it wasn't just that they chose books.

我想你的意思是你有很多.。你可以从很多不同的书中选择？是的，是的。所以不仅仅是他们选择了书。

It was that books give you  ... Jeff Bezos wanted to start a store and one of the most important things  when you're getting started is differentiation. So you don't have to make a product that's  going to appeal to everyone immediately, but you need to make a product that is  going to appeal to some people more than anything else. You want to find some  way to differentiate. And usually you want to do that by doing something that's going  to be easy for you, but that's really hard for all the existing companies. And  the internet enables this, in Amazon's case, because brick and mortar stores have limited space  to hold their inventory and so you realize that as on the internet you can  have big warehouse somewhere, you can have items shipped from all over and this is  something that enables you to offer much wider selection than a normal store. Then you  go and run through the thought experiment. You say, "Well, if what we can do  is provide better selection, then which category, what kind of store is going to benefit  the most from upgrade or selection?" And it turns out that books is a category  where you have the most ... There are more books than there are other products,  right? So, if you look at movies, it's very expensive to make a movie.

是书给你的.。杰夫·贝佐斯(JeffBezos)想开一家商店，而当你开始的时候，最重要的事情之一就是差异化。所以你不需要制作一个能立刻吸引所有人的产品，但是你需要制造一个比其他任何东西都更吸引人的产品。你想要找到一些方法来区分。通常你想要做一些对你来说很容易的事情，但这对所有现有的公司来说都是很难的。在亚马逊的例子中，互联网实现了这一点，因为砖房和实体店的库存空间有限，所以你会意识到，在互联网上，你可以在某个地方拥有大型仓库，你可以从各地运送物品，这使得你可以提供比普通商店更广泛的选择。然后你去做思想实验。你会说，“好吧，如果我们能提供更好的选择，那么哪种类型的商店将从升级或选择中获益最大？”事实证明，书籍是你拥有最多.书比其他产品多，对吧？所以，如果你看电影，拍一部电影是非常昂贵的。

It's  not an industry that would benefit immediately from the internet in a way that books  would.

这并不是一个能立即从互联网中获益的行业，就像书籍一样。

I think there's this general point here that measurement can turn a vague idea  into a good idea and if you do a lot of these kind of like  back of envelope calculations, it can really help sharpen your ideas and it can help  you iterate and move through the space of ideas a lot faster than if you  have to go and build a prototype. You can imagine what if Amazon started and  they started to focus on movies and after a few years they realized that it  wasn't working that well, then they're set back by a few years, now there's competition.  These kind of metrics on, even on the realm of ideas, can really help you  get started. And the one other thing that I would say about this is that  you ...

我认为这里有一个一般性的观点，测量可以把一个模糊的想法转变成一个好的想法，如果你做了很多类似于信封计算的事情，它真的可以帮助你的想法变得更清晰，它可以帮助你更快地迭代和在想法的空间中移动，比你去建造一个原型的速度要快得多。你可以想象，如果亚马逊一开始就开始专注于电影，几年后他们意识到它没有那么好地运作，然后他们倒退了几年，现在有了竞争。这种衡量标准，即使是在思想领域，也能真正帮助您开始工作。我要说的另一件事是你.

I think using measurement here is very good for helping you figure out  what products are going to be possible, where you're going to be able to provide  a lot of value to a user.

我认为在这里使用度量非常好，可以帮助您了解哪些产品是可能的，您将能够为用户提供大量的价值。

I actually don't think metrics work that well  for stuff like market size, so you just saw this example that Stewart, they thought  that market size for chat was a hundred million a year in revenue, it turns  out to be a hundred times bigger. Just very hard to figure those things out.  I wouldn't spend a lot of time on that.

实际上，我不认为衡量标准对市场规模这样的东西有那么好的效果，所以你刚刚看到了Stewart的例子，他们认为聊天的市场规模是每年1亿美元的收入，结果是原来的100倍。只是很难弄明白。我不会花太多时间在这上面。

I think you want to know  that whatever you're doing, some day there's some path for it to eventually get really  big, but you want to really apply your metrics to how can you differentiate your  product and what's going to be possible that wasn't previously possible. Okay. So next to  that, now you're building your product and what should you measure. Just any guesses, if  you guys have products, what are you measuring, what would you recommend?
Speaker 6: Amount of users.

我想你想知道，无论你在做什么，总有一天它会变得很大，但是你想把你的度量标准应用到如何区分你的产品，以及什么是可能的，这是以前不可能的。好的。接下来，你要建立你的产品，你应该测量什么。任何猜测，如果你们有产品，你在测量什么，你会推荐什么？扬声器6：用户数量。

Adam D.: The amount of users. Yeah, yeah. So what exactly would you mean when you say  that?
Speaker 6: How many people use it total and how often people use it .

亚当·D：用户数量。是的，是的。当你这么说的时候你到底是什么意思？演讲者6：总共有多少人使用它，人们使用它的频率有多高。

Adam D.: Yeah, yeah. So how many people use it total and how often they use it.  Go ahead.

亚当·D：是的，是的。那么，有多少人总共使用它，以及他们使用它的频率。您先请

Speaker 7: I think people share it .

演讲者7：我想大家都有同感。

Adam D.: Whether it's growing, whether they do something . Yeah, go ahead.

亚当·D：它是否在生长，它们是否在做什么。好吧，来吧。

Speaker 8: Total addressable market, like when you're getting started.

演讲者8：完全可寻址的市场，就像你刚开始的时候。

Adam D.: Total addressable market, yeah. Yeah?
Speaker 9: User retention.

完全可寻址的市场，是的。嗯发言者9：用户保留。

Adam D.: Yeah, user retention. So, these are all great ideas. There's lots of things that you  can measure. As a startup, you really need to focus, so the core concept I  would try to focus on is users that are getting value today. So, there's different  indicators of this. You might say you want to focus on active users, people are  going to be active if they're getting value, might want to focus on revenue, that's  a sign that people are getting value.

是的，用户保持不变。所以，这些都是伟大的想法。有很多东西你可以测量。作为一家初创企业，你真的需要专注，所以我想要关注的核心概念是那些正在获得价值的用户。因此，这方面有不同的指标。你可能会说你想关注活跃的用户，如果他们获得了价值，人们就会活跃起来，也许他们想要关注收入，这表明人们正在获得价值。

In the case of a market place, where  you have things like buyers and sellers, that's usually a case where it makes sense  to measure transactions. Any time you have these different groups, if you say, "Okay, we're  going to measure buyers and then we're going to measure sellers," then there's actually a  lot of stuff you can do that will make things better for the buyers and  worse for the sellers and some of those things are good. Measuring transactions is a  way to unify them and align your work on things that are going to benefit  both sides.

在市场的情况下，你有买家和卖家这样的东西，通常情况下，衡量交易是有意义的。任何时候，如果你有不同的群体，如果你说，“好的，我们要测量买家，然后我们要测量卖家，”那么实际上你可以做很多事情，这将使事情对买家更好，对卖家更糟，而其中一些事情是好的。度量事务是一种统一事务的方法，并使您的工作对双方都有好处。

If you have a two-sided market or anything like that, then you want  to measure transactions or transaction values. Things like eBay, they'll measure total value of all  the goods that are sold on eBay. To start, this is kind of a quick  thing. And you go a long way just by measuring this.

如果你有一个双边市场或类似的东西，那么你想要衡量交易或交易价值。像eBay这样的东西，它们将衡量在eBay上出售的所有商品的总价值。首先，这是一件快速的事情。你只要测量一下这个就能走很远的路。

If you're not measuring  anything, you're susceptible to all these cognitive biases that Stewart talked about, all kinds of  problems, you're just not going to know what's going on. Next most important thing to  think about is retention. First, I want to make sure everyone understands what a cohort  is. A cohort is all the users who first use your product in a certain  time window. So for a startup, you might make the time window a week. So  you can say, "There's a cohort of all the users who first use your product  in the first week that it launched." And you can track those users over time.  There's a cohort of all the users that first used the product a week later  and you measure all these cohorts and you can track them. This tells you what's  happening to users over time.

如果你没有测量任何东西，你很容易受到斯图尔特谈到的所有认知偏见，各种各样的问题，你只是不知道发生了什么。接下来要考虑的最重要的事情是保留。首先，我想确保每个人都明白什么是队列。一个队列是所有的用户谁首先使用您的产品在一定的时间窗口。因此，对于一家初创公司来说，你可能每周都有时间窗。所以你可以说，“在你的产品推出的第一周，就有一群用户第一次使用你的产品。”你可以在一段时间内追踪这些用户。一周后第一次使用该产品的所有用户中有一个队列，您可以测量所有这些队列，然后跟踪它们。这将告诉您用户经过一段时间后发生了什么。

It's a really important way to balance you're just measuring  the total value that all the users are getting. This is a graph of total  of cohort usage for a relatively old internet product. The blue line is users who  joined this product in 2004 and so you can see ... The y-axis here is  what percent of them are still using it and x-axis is time. So over time,  if you just follow the blue line, you can see, basically, every month there's fewer  and fewer people that join the product in 2004 that are still using it. This  is basically the same story for all these different cohort lines. What do you think  is going to happen to this product in ten ... This is about six years,  the scale of this graph. What do think is going to happen in six years  later? Any guesses? Yeah?
Speaker 10: It's going to be opposite.

这是一种非常重要的平衡方式，您只需衡量所有用户所获得的总价值。这是一个相对较老的互联网产品的总体使用情况图。蓝线是2004年加入这个产品的用户，所以你可以看到.这里的y轴是他们中仍在使用它的百分比，而x轴就是时间。因此，随着时间的推移，如果你只是按照蓝线，你可以看到，基本上，每个月，有越来越少的人加入该产品在2004年仍在使用它。对于所有这些不同的队列来说，这基本上是一个相同的故事。你认为这个产品在十年后会发生什么.这大约是六年，这张图的规模。你认为六年后会发生什么？有猜测吗？嗯演讲者10：这将是相反的。

Adam D.: It's going to turn around?
Speaker 10: Yeah.

亚当·D：它会掉头吗？演讲者10：是的。

Adam D.: Yeah, good.

亚当·D：是的，很好。

I think something would need ... Something different would have to happen to  change that.

我想有些东西需要.。要改变这种状况，就必须有一些不同的事情发生。

Speaker 11: No one wants to use it.

演讲者11：没有人想用它。

Adam D.: No one will be using it, yeah.

亚当·D：没有人会用它，是的。

It's hard to know what would happen.

很难知道会发生什么。

I  think probably everyone's going to stop using their product. Some companies will manage to turn  these around, but it's very hard to because you get fewer and fewer ... You  get less and less usage from your old users.

我想每个人都会停止使用他们的产品。有些公司会设法扭转这种局面，但这是非常困难的，因为你得到的越来越少.从旧用户那里得到的使用越来越少。

It's also usually the old users  are what cause you to get new users. So if you have this problem, it's  pretty bad. This is a pretty scary place to be. You can have a ton  of users, you can have total usage growing, but if usage from every cohort is  declining, then you're going to run into big problems. There's this idea called the ring  of fire, which is a way to kind of visualize this. Unless there's some kind  of lower bound, you're going to burn out all your users. So here's the analogy.  Imagine there's a big field of, let's say, of dead grass and someone lights a  match in the middle. You're going to get a fire and the fire is going  to grow and grow, but then in the middle of the fire, you're going to  start to run out of fuel and it's going to burn out. So you get  this ring and the ring is going to get bigger and bigger and in the  center you're going to burn out more and more of the fuel. And so the  fire will get bigger and bigger, but eventually you're going to run out of the  whole field and the fire's going to stop. You don't want this to happen. Here's  an animation I made to try to illustrate this. Here's what you notice.

通常，旧用户也是导致您获得新用户的原因。所以如果你有这个问题，那就很糟糕了。这是个很可怕的地方。你可以拥有大量的用户，总使用量也在增长，但是如果来自每一个群体的使用量都在下降，那么你就会遇到很大的问题。有一个叫做“火环”的想法，这是一种形象化的方法。除非有某种下限，否则您将耗尽所有用户。这就是类比。想象一下，有一大片，比如说，死草，有人在中间点着一根火柴。你会生火，火会生长，但在火的中间，你会开始耗尽燃料，然后它就会燃烧殆尽。所以你得到这个环，环会变大，在中间，你会消耗越来越多的燃料。所以火会越来越大，但最终你会跑出整个领域，火就会停止。你不会希望这种事发生的。这是我制作的一个动画，用来说明这一点。这是你注意到的。

It looks  great at first. There's more fire every frame than the previous frame, but in the  end, there's nothing. Right? You don't want this to happen.

一开始看起来很棒。每一帧都比前一帧有更多的火焰，但最终，什么也没有。对吗？你不会希望这种事发生的。

It's really important to internalize  this concept, because if you don't you can fool yourself and you can do a  lot of things that are going to cause you to get more and more usage  over time, but at the expense of the existing users. And if you don't do  this, eventually, your company is going to die.

将这个概念内化是非常重要的，因为如果你不这样做，你可以欺骗自己，你可以做很多事情，这些事情会让你得到越来越多的使用，但代价是牺牲现有的用户。如果你不这么做，你的公司最终会死的。

I think some recent examples are, I  think Groupon was a good example of this. They got huge, tons of usage. All  these merchants, but it wasn't a good experience for the merchants in the long term  so they all stopped using it. And then I think more recently, Pokemon Go is  another example, got really big, lots of users, but it just kind of faded away.  So, you don't want to build a fad. You want to build something that's going  to last, so you need to make sure that you're measuring the usage from the  existing users.

我认为最近的一些例子是，我认为Groupon就是一个很好的例子。他们得到了大量的大量使用。所有这些商人，但这不是一个好的经验，从长期的商人，所以他们都停止使用它。后来我想，最近，口袋妖怪围棋是另一个例子，它拥有大量的用户，但它只是渐渐消失了。所以，你不想建立一个时尚。您想要构建一些将持续的东西，所以您需要确保您正在从现有的用户中测量使用情况。

It's not just that you're getting more users. You need to make sure  the existing users keep using the product. Actually, if this can go in reverse, you  are in an extremely powerful position. There's a small number of products where the cohort  usage actually will increase over time. One example is WhatsApp.

这不仅仅是因为你得到了更多的用户。您需要确保现有用户继续使用该产品。实际上，如果这可以倒过来，你就处于一个非常强大的位置。有一小部分产品的队列使用实际上将增加随着时间的推移。WhatsApp就是一个例子。

I think most messaging apps,  as you get more of your friends on the app, there's more people to send  messages to and so they're able to get this increase in cohort usage over time.  Uber on the rider side, this is another good example, as people start to get  used to Uber, they use it more, as the pickup times come down, they use  it more, as prices come down, they use it more and so that's really ...  Uber is in a really strong position there.

我认为大多数即时通讯应用，当你在这个应用上有更多的朋友，有更多的人发送信息，所以他们能够得到这种增加的队列使用随着时间的推移。优步在骑手方面，这是另一个很好的例子，当人们开始习惯优步时，他们会更多地使用它，随着接车时间的减少，他们会更多地使用它，随着价格的下降，他们会更多地使用它，所以这真的.优步在那里处于非常有利的地位。

It's not true on the driver side.  Uber has problems on the driver side because they don't have this property there. And  then Facebook, you can see in the numbers they report publicly, they keep on ...  Their total usage is growing faster than their number of users. You know that they  must have this increasing usage per user over time.

司机那边不是这样的。优步在司机方面有问题，因为他们在那里没有这个房产。然后脸书，你可以看到他们公开报道的数字，他们继续.他们的总使用量比他们的用户数增长得更快。您知道，随着时间的推移，每个用户的使用量必须不断增加。

If you can get to this  ... This is a very hard to get to this, but if you can get  to this point then you're in a really strong position. One way to actually think  about an idea is whether ... As the product gets bigger, as you get more  users, as you develop the market, is it the kind of product where people would  use it more over time? I think that's another kind of lens you can apply  as you're considering ideas. Just one more data point. This venture capitalist named Tom Tunguz  did a study on what predicts valuations that startups raise money at and it's just  a simple corelation study and these are some different factors in how much they correlate  to the valuation that the startups can make at. First is growth of revenue and  that's 0.18 correlation. Second is just how much revenue they have in total. That actually  correlates a little bit more strongly than growth, but by far the strongest correlation is  account expansion, which means people spending more over time, which is same thing as retention  increasing over time. And this correlation is extremely strong. So for a complex number, like  what the valuation of a company is going to be, the fact that you can  explain 0.54 out of 1 of the variation in that number by the single variable  about whether the company is increasing revenue per user over time, that's a sign that  ...

如果你能做到这一点.。这是一个很难做到这一点，但如果你能达到这一点，那么你处于一个非常强大的地位。思考一个想法的方法之一是.当产品变得越来越大，当你拥有更多的用户，当你开发市场的时候，它是否会随着时间的推移人们会更多地使用它呢？我认为这是另一种镜头，你可以应用，因为你正在考虑的想法。再来一个数据点。这位名叫Tom Tunguz的风险投资家做了一项研究，研究了如何预测初创企业的估值-这只是一个简单的相关性研究-这些都是不同的因素，它们与初创企业的估值有多大的相关性。首先是收入的增长，这是0.18的相关性。第二，他们总共有多少收入。这实际上比增长更紧密一些，但迄今为止相关性最强的是账户扩张，这意味着人们的支出随着时间的推移而增加，这与随着时间的推移而保持不变是一回事。这种相关性非常强。所以对于一个复杂的数字，比如一个公司的估值，你可以用一个变量来解释这个数字的变化中的0.54，即公司是否会随着时间的推移增加每个用户的收入，这是一个迹象.。

It's almost like there are just two classes of companies. One class where there's  increasing revenue over time and another class that gets totally different valuations where this is  not happening. The main thing I just want you to remember from today is you  should measure your retention. That's going to lead you to do a lot of things  that will help you in all kinds of ways.

几乎只有两类公司。一个类别的收入随着时间的推移而增加，另一个类别得到完全不同的估值，而这是不可能的。我只想让你记住的是，从今天开始，你应该测量你的记忆力。这将引导你做很多事情，在各种方面都会对你有所帮助。

It's going to help you grow,  it's going to help you retain your users, it's going to help you build a  product that users really love. Next, I just want to talk about exponential growth. Retention  is the most important thing, but it's not sufficient. You need to have a product  that's going to retain your users, but that's not necessarily enough to make sure that  you're going to be able to build a big product and reach everyone. You also  need to make sure that you're going to grow. And by far the most powerful  way to grow is through exponential growth. This is just a few functions plotted. The  red line is linear growth and blue line is cubic growth and then the green  line is exponential growth. The linear growth path ... You can do this through things,  like continually doing PR you can get more and more users, but eventually ... There's  a limit to how big you're going to be able to get.

它将帮助你成长，它将帮助你留住你的用户，它将帮助你建立一个用户真正喜欢的产品。接下来，我只想谈一谈指数增长。保留是最重要的，但还不够。你需要一个能留住你的用户的产品，但这不一定能确保你能够建立一个大的产品，并接触到每个人。你还需要确保你能成长。到目前为止，最有力的增长方式是指数增长。这只是绘制的几个函数。红线为线性增长，蓝线为立方生长，绿线为指数增长。线性增长路径.。你可以通过一些事情来做这件事，比如不断地做公关-你可以得到越来越多的用户，但是最终.你能得到多大是有限度的。

It gets expensive  to run advertising, it gets expensive to do these kinds of things that attract a  fixed number of users, but if you can do things that cause you to get  users in proportion to the number of users you already have, then that's going to  get you to exponential growth. There's other places to learn about what to do to  grow faster, but as you're measuring your growth, you want to make sure that the  way you measure it is aligned with what you want. And if what you want  is exponential growth, then what you need to measure is the rate of growth. A  good way to measure this is just the percent increase per week in how much  usage you have or how much revenue you have. This is a tweet from Paul  that I especially agreed with. He said, "A suggestion for really tough founders is instead  of graphing your revenue, graph the percent growth per week." I actually don't know why  he said that this is for really tough founders.

做广告的成本越来越高，做这些吸引固定用户数量的事情会变得很昂贵，但如果你能做一些事情，让你的用户数量与你已经拥有的用户成比例，那你就会得到指数级的增长。还有其他地方可以学习如何更快地成长，但是当你在测量你的成长时，你想要确保你测量它的方式和你想要的是一致的。如果你想要的是指数增长，那么你需要衡量的是增长率。衡量这一点的一个好方法就是每周使用多少或有多少收入的百分比增加。这是保罗的推特，我特别同意。他说：“对于真正强硬的创始人来说，一个建议不是用图表来表示你的收入，而是把每周的增长率绘制成图表。”实际上我不知道他为什么说这是给非常强硬的创始人的。

I actually think this is what's  going to make you really tough, if you measure this.

实际上，我认为这会让你变得很艰难，如果你去衡量的话。

I think can go the  other way. This is a very important thing to measure. The reason he says you  need to be tough is that it's going to be hard to keep up exponential  growth and it's going to be hard to ...

我认为可以走另一条路。这是一个非常重要的测量。他说你需要坚强的原因是很难保持指数增长，也很难.

It may not feel good to  just see this line that doesn't increase, but ... You can also measure your total  revenue. There's no problem with doing that, but just make sure that you're measuring the  percent growth per week. There's going to be things you can do that don't cause  exponential growth that would actually help you maybe more in the short term and you  want to focus on stuff that's going to cause the product to grow in the  short term and in the long term, which is basically things like viral growth, getting  users to invite more of their friends, getting word of mouth spreading, getting some kind  of dynamic where the bigger your product gets the easier it is to attract the  next user to it. Next I want to talk about iteration. One of the most  important advantages you have as a startup is you can iterate faster than a big  company. There's all kinds of things that cause it to be hard for companies to  change direction and you just don't have these forces when you're a small company.

看到这条线不增加可能不太好，但是.你也可以衡量你的总收入。这样做没有问题，但要确保你每周都在测量增长率。在短期内，你可以做一些不会带来指数增长的事情张口传播，获得某种动态，当你的产品越大，就越容易吸引下一个用户。接下来，我想谈谈迭代。作为一家初创公司，你最重要的优势之一就是你可以比一家大公司更快地迭代。有各种各样的事情使得公司很难改变方向，而当你是一家小公司的时候，你就是没有这些力量。

If  you can iterate much, much faster than other companies, then you can go through ideas  faster, you can go through changes to your product faster, you can go through changes  to improve retention faster, you can go through changes to increase growth faster.

如果你能比其他公司更快地迭代，那么你就可以更快地完成你的想法，你可以更快地完成你的产品的改变，你可以更快地通过改变来提高你的保留率，你可以通过改变来提高你的增长速度。

It's going  to add up to a really, really strong position. But at the same time, you  have to iterate in the right direction. So, one of the reasons metrics, even just  simple metrics are so important, is that they let you know whether you're going in  the right direction. They let you know whether what you're doing is working and they  let you ... Out of all these different ways you can go, they kind of  help you stay aligned. One other point I want to make, I think this isn't  mentioned too often, but you can measure how fast you're iterating and you can measure  all these components of iteration. Whether it's fully quantified or not, you should have in  your head "How long did this cycle take us and what can we do to  make the next cycle faster?" At Quora, one of the metrics we track is how  long does it take from an engineer hitting commit on their code to us being  able to run the unit test and then get that code out into production and  we try to keep that between 10 and 15 minutes from change in the code  base to it being totally out to all the users, because that allows people to  iterate just much, much faster. And if we didn't track that metric, there's just a  lot of forces that naturally would cause that to get slower.

它将形成一个非常强大的地位。但同时，你必须朝着正确的方向迭代。因此，其中一个原因是，即使是简单的度量也是如此重要，因为它们让您知道您是否在朝着正确的方向前进。他们让你知道你在做什么，他们让你.在所有这些不同的方法中，它们可以帮助你保持一致。我想指出的另一点是，我认为这不是经常提到的，但是您可以度量迭代的速度，也可以度量迭代的所有这些组件。无论它是否完全量化，你应该在你的头脑中“这个周期花了我们多长时间，我们能做些什么来使下一个周期更快？”在Quora，我们跟踪的一个度量标准是，从一个工程师开始提交他们的代码到我们能够运行单元测试，然后将该代码输出到生产中需要多长时间，我们尝试将代码库的更改保持在10到15分钟之间，直到所有用户完全退出，因为这样人们就可以更快地迭代。如果我们不跟踪这个指标，就会有很多的力，自然会导致速度变慢。

I think a lot  of companies end up ... They'll maybe start out like that, then they end up  releasing daily or they go to weekly or even monthly.

我想很多公司最终.。他们可能会这样开始，然后他们最终每天发布，或者他们去每周，甚至每月。

I've heard of teams that  are on every three months they do a release. And you just imagine, how could  you possibly iterate if your releases are only going monthly or even weekly. Next, there's  a spectrum of how seriously to take metrics that I see a lot of companies  stumble on. On the one hand, there's not taking your metrics seriously enough and this  might mean things like, you don't have metrics, might be that you have metrics, they're  on some page but no one ever looks at that, it might mean that you  have metrics and one person in the company looks at it but no one else  looks at it. The issues that happen on this end of the spectrum are, you  kind of ... You can fool yourself, you go around in circles, you just lose  sense of what the right things to do are. But then there's another end of  the spectrum where you can actually take metrics too seriously. You got to remember that  metrics are an abstraction. What you actually care about underneath is, lets say, the value  to the users and maybe the long term value to the users. A good metric  will be strongly correlated with that, but it won't be perfect and so you don't  want to forget that there's a reality under the metric that's not exactly the metric  itself and if you focus too much on the metrics, then you start to get  into things like, "Oh, there's these ways to gain the metrics and we can make  the metrics go up but actually we're doing some things that are going to hurt  us long term and those things are going to outweigh the short term benefits." I  would really make sure to be careful about that.

我听说过每三个月就有一支球队发布一次。你可以想象，如果你的版本仅仅是每个月，甚至每周一次，你怎么可能迭代。接下来，我看到很多公司都在摸索着如何认真对待度量标准。一方面，没有足够的重视你的度量标准，这可能意味着，你没有度量标准，也许你有度量标准，它们在某个页面上，但从来没有人看过它，这可能意味着你有度量标准，公司中的一个人看它，但是没有人看它。在光谱的这一端发生的问题是，你有点.你可以自欺欺人，你绕着圈转，你只是失去了做正确事情的感觉。但是，还有另一个极端，你实际上可以太认真地对待度量。您必须记住，度量是一种抽象。你实际上关心的是，让我们说，对用户的价值，也许是对用户的长期价值。一个好的度量将与此密切相关，但是它并不完美，所以你不想忘记，在度量下有一个不完全是度量本身的现实，如果你过多地关注度量，那么你就开始进入这样的事情：“哦，有一些方法可以获得度量，我们可以做出度量但实际上，我们正在做一些长期伤害我们的事情，这些事情将超过短期利益。“我真的会很小心的。

I'd say, personally, I think the  ideal is to be somewhere in the middle and I'd say you want to be  very close to taking the metrics extremely seriously. Not too seriously, but I think most  companies bias toward not being serious enough about their metrics.

我会说，就我个人而言，我认为理想的做法是在中间的某个地方，我想说，你想非常认真地对待这些指标。不是很认真，但我认为大多数公司倾向于对他们的指标不够认真。

If you're in the middle,  in the right spot, then you're learning, you're making good decisions and you're informed, but  you're still aware that there is a product underneath and there is a strategy and  there's more to the world than just these metrics.

如果你处于中间位置，在正确的位置，那么你在学习，你做出了正确的决定，你被告知了，但你仍然意识到，在你的背后有一个产品，有一个战略，世界上有更多的东西，不仅仅是这些指标。

I see a lot of the  times companies would oscillate between these. They'll really focus on metrics and that cause them  to do some things that they think are bad and they, "Well, these metrics are  terrible and we're going to throw away our metrics, not focus on them at all."  Then you get into this world where you don't actually know what you're doing and  there's no accountability and so oscillation is not very productive. You want to just make  sure you find the right point and try to stick there. Finally, I want to  just talk about some of these psychological aspects that come with metrics.

我看到很多时候，公司会在这两者之间摇摆不定。他们真的会专注于度量，这会导致他们做一些他们认为不好的事情，他们，“嗯，这些度量标准很糟糕，我们将抛弃我们的度量标准，而不是关注它们。”然后你进入这个世界，你不知道你在做什么，也没有责任，所以振荡不是很有效率。你只想确保你找到了正确的观点，并试着坚持下去。最后，我只想谈谈一些与度量有关的心理方面。

I think one  of the big things that comes when you start measuring things is you just get  closer to being in touch with reality. That can be painful because sometimes the metrics  are going to be worse than you thought they were. Sometimes, actually, they can be  better than you thought and that's great and everyone feels great, but a lot of  the times if you weren't measuring something, chances are you weren't even aware of it,  it was hard for you to make it good and so it won't be good.  That means that as you set up metrics, there's going to be some pain and  that can cause problems for companies.

我认为，当你开始测量事物时，最重要的事情之一就是你更接近于与现实的联系。这可能会很痛苦，因为有时候度量标准会比您想象的还要糟糕。有时候，实际上，他们会比你想象的更好，这很好，每个人都感觉很好，但是很多时候，如果你不测量一些东西，很可能你甚至没有意识到，你很难让它变得好，所以它不会是好的。这意味着，当您设置度量标准时，会有一些痛苦，这可能会给公司带来问题。

I even think at the leadership level, this can  get even worse.

我甚至认为，在领导层面，这可能会变得更糟。

I think the majority of leaders out there in the world rely  on some amount of delusion they're creating among their followers to get them excited, to  have them working on this project in the first place and metrics can get in  the way of that. People get into this ... They get into this question, "Okay,  well, should we ... " What should you do as a leader and this is  where I come out, after thinking about this for a long time, I think you  want to be learning from the past, so you want everyone fully aware of what  has happened, what has worked, what has not worked. You want to be totally in  touch with the reality of where you are today. So, if things are good, you  should know they're good.

我认为，世界上大多数领导者都依赖于他们在追随者中制造的某种错觉，让他们兴奋起来，让他们从一开始就从事这个项目，而衡量标准可能会阻碍这一进程。人们会卷入这件事.。他们提出了一个问题，“好吧，我们应该.”作为一个领导者，你应该做什么-这就是我出来的地方-在思考了很长一段时间之后，我认为你想从过去学习，所以你希望每个人都充分意识到已经发生了什么，什么起了作用，什么不起作用。你想要完全接触你今天所处的现实。所以，如果事情好的话，你应该知道他们很好。

If things are not good, you should know they're not good,  you should know exactly where there are problems and where there are not problems. But  then, those things are not intention with being optimistic about the future. You should be  optimistic about the future because there's so much potential. The reason you're doing a startup  is because of this potential and if you don't feel confident that the path you're  on is able to get you to a place that you feel optimistic about, then  that's a good sign that you might want to change the path and you should  do something about that because that's totally within your control. There's not really a tension  between acknowledging that things are not in a great spot and having people not be  optimistic about the future. As long as you just make sure that ... The reality  is, and I don't think you should make the people optimistic about the future in  a way that you don't believe it.

如果事情不好，你应该知道它们不好，你应该确切地知道哪里有问题，哪里没有问题。但是，这些事情并不意味着对未来持乐观态度。你应该对未来保持乐观，因为那里有很多潜力。你之所以创业，是因为你有这样的潜力，如果你不相信你所走的道路能够让你走上一个你感到乐观的地方，那么这是一个很好的迹象，表明你可能想改变这条道路，你应该为此做点什么，因为这完全在你的控制范围之内。在承认事情不是一个好地方和让人们对未来不乐观之间并没有真正的矛盾。只要你确保.。事实是，我不认为你应该以一种你不相信的方式让人们对未来感到乐观。

I think you should do the things you  need to do to get yourself to be confident and optimistic about the future and  then it's easy to get people to follow through that. That's all I have and  happy to take questions.

我认为你应该做一些你需要做的事情，让你自己对未来充满信心和乐观，然后很容易让人们跟随它。这就是我的全部，我很乐意回答问题。
