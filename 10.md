# How to Invent the Future II - Alan Kay

Speaker 1: I kept on rewriting the title. This is not a bad title for this class.  Another way of looking at it is, instead of trying to move forward from here,  where everything is confusing and the present looks like reality, we want to go out  to the future and bring it back. We talked about some process and methods. Today  we're going to talk about a few of the gazillion things. Of course I didn't  get done last week, which made this week even more, and finally I decided, "Screw  it, I'm going to do both of these talks again without an audience to do  them to their natural length," because the destiny for this is being online, and online  people are not confined to 50-minute hours.

演讲者1：我一直在重写标题。这对这门课来说是个不错的题目。另一种看待它的方法是，我们不想从这里继续前进，在这里，一切都是混乱的，现在看起来像现实，我们想要走向未来，把它带回来。我们讨论了一些过程和方法。今天我们将讨论一些非常重要的事情。当然，上个星期我还没做完，这一周做得更多，最后我决定，“去他妈的，我要再做一次这两次演讲，而不需要观众按照他们的自然长度来做”，因为这件事的命运是在线的，而且网络上的人不限于50分钟的时间。

I'm sure Sam was all for that. Great.  Again, here's my email address. Out of all the people who are tuned into this  talk and in the classroom, I've got three emails, one of which is interesting. That  means that either or both of, my talk isn't interesting or you're not interesting or  both. Try and least disabuse me of the latter. Okay, so to start off with,  here's Leonardo. Pretty smart guy.

我肯定萨姆就是这么想的。太棒了这是我的电子邮件地址。在所有关注这个演讲和课堂的人中，我收到了三封电子邮件，其中一封很有趣。这意味着，我的谈话要么不有趣，要么你不感兴趣，或者两者兼而有之。尽量别再伤害我了。好吧，首先，莱昂纳多来了。很聪明的家伙。

Imagine if you were born with twice Leonardo's IQ. Think  about how easy it would be to get into Stanford. Maybe you do have twice  Leonardo's IQ, but suppose you were born with twice Leonardo's IQ in 10,000 BC. How  far are you going to get? Zip, right? Before they burn you at the stake  or whatever they did back then. Yeah, so, here's a guy with nowhere near Leonardo's  IQ, Henry Ford. Whereas Leonardo could not invent a single motor for any of his  vehicles, think about that, so here was smart but he wasn't that smart, Henry Ford  was able to put together processes that allowed him to make millions and millions of  cars, sell them for about $800 a piece, and the difference between the two was  that Ford was born into the right century and Leonardo was born into the wrong  century. The knowledge that had accumulated in the 19th century made much more difference than  any level of smartness. Where did that knowledge came from? It came, might as well  pick Newton if you're going to pick anybody, it came because the context was changed  from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to something completely different in the 17th century,  and Newton made the biggest change of anybody. We could call that change a change  in outlook, we could call it a change in context, worldview, point of view, whatever  you want.

想象一下，如果你出生时的智商是莱昂纳多的两倍。想想进入斯坦福大学有多容易。也许你的智商是莱昂纳多的两倍，但假设你在公元前一万年出生时的智商是莱昂纳多的两倍。你要走多远？闭嘴，对吧？在他们用火刑烧死你之前。是的，所以，有个人的智商和莱昂纳多差得远，亨利·福特。莱昂纳多不可能为他的任何一辆汽车发明一台发动机，想想看，所以这里很聪明，但他并不那么聪明，亨利·福特(Henry Ford)能够将生产数百万辆汽车的过程组合起来，以800美元左右的价格出售给他，两者的区别在于福特诞生于正确的世纪，莱昂纳多出生在错误的世纪。19世纪积累的知识比任何程度的聪明都要重要得多。这些知识是从哪里来的？它来了，如果你要选谁的话最好选牛顿，它的出现是因为从中世纪到文艺复兴的背景在17世纪发生了完全不同的变化，牛顿做出了最大的改变。我们可以称之为观点的改变，我们可以称之为环境的改变，世界观的改变，观点的改变，任何你想要的。

I'm numbering rules for you, I decided to go back and start with  zero. The zeroth rule here, probably the most important one, is to make progress here,  let me move this guy off, context or point of view is worth 80 IQ  points.

我给你规定了编号规则，我决定回去，从零开始。这里的第零法则，也许是最重要的一条，就是在这里取得进展，让我把这个家伙移开，上下文或观点都值80个智商点。

If you've got the context of science and math, you're gazillion times smarter effectively  than the smartest people of antiquity, like Archimedes. A person who learns calculus with an  IQ of 110 or 120 can do things that the great geniuses of the past  can't do. We can sum that up by saying knowledge is silver, context is gold,  and IQ is just lead.

如果你有科学和数学的背景，你比阿基米德这样的古代最聪明的人聪明得多。一个学习微积分的人，智商是110或120，他可以做一些过去伟大的天才所不能做的事情。我们可以通过说知识是银的，语境是金的，智商只是引导，来总结这一点。

It's a lead weight on you. The biggest problem with  most people who are at your level and going to the next level is, you're  always the smartest people in your classroom or room at home, but that only means  you're the smartest people amongst 30 or 100.

这对你来说是个沉重的负担。大多数和你同等学历的人最大的问题是，在你的教室或房间里，你总是最聪明的人，但这只意味着你是30到100个人中最聪明的人。

If you happen to be in a  room that had the 100 smartest people in the world and you were the smartest  person in that room, you're still not as smart as the 99 working together. Being  clever doesn't do it. This is the simplest , is the IQ . Tony Hoare,  really great guy, was here at Stanford for a while, Turing winner, said, "Debugging is  harder than programming, so don't use all your cleverness to write the program." Anybody recognize  this? Anybody write programs here? Let me see hands. Yeah. People are so clever writing  the program, they forget that debugging is harder. That's true about anything. That's principle number  one, we had zero. Here's a summary of what I showed you, and the number  two one at the top there is that the goodness of the results correlates most  strongly with the goodness of the funders. This is the simplest way of summing up  the past. Because you have to realize, the difference in the past wasn't that the  people were smarter back then. We weren't smarter than the smart people today. Every generation  has really smart people. The difference in whether you get enormous results or not is  in this context idea and the funders that support it. One of the ways of  thinking about them is, as opposed to getting gold medals like a bunch of us  have gotten in our 60s and 70s, 40 years after you did the deeds, good  funders give out the gold medals ahead of time knowing that 70% of them were  going to turn to lead. Because the funders give it out before you've gotten the  results. This will be a slide that you can use later on.

如果你碰巧在一个有着世界上最聪明的100个人的房间里，而你是那个房间里最聪明的人，你仍然没有99人一起工作那么聪明。聪明并不能做到。这是最简单的，是智商。托尼·霍雷(TonyHoare)，一个非常棒的人，曾在斯坦福大学呆过一段时间，图灵·温特说：“调试比编程更难，所以不要用你所有的聪明才智来编写这个程序。”有人认得这个吗？有人在这里写程序吗？让我看看手。是啊。人们编写这个程序是如此的聪明，以至于他们忘记了调试是很困难的。任何事情都是这样的。这是第一原则，我们没有。这是我向你们展示的一个总结，上面的第二位是，结果的好与资助者的善良密切相关。这是总结过去最简单的方法。因为你必须意识到，过去的不同并不是那时的人们更聪明。我们并不比今天的聪明人聪明。每一代人都有真正聪明的人。无论你是否获得了巨大的结果，不同的是在这个背景下的想法和支持它的资助者。其中一种思考方式是，与我们中的一群人在六七十年代获得金牌相反，在你做这些事40年后，好的资助者会提前发放金牌，因为他们中的70%都会转向领军。因为资助者在你得到结果之前就给出了答案。这将是您稍后可以使用的幻灯片。

It's basically what  I said last time. Last time we looked at four systems, a sketchpad, we didn't  really look at the Englebart System, but it's easy to find out about online. We  looked at the first really good gesture system, GRAIL, and we saw that Ivan Sutherland,  again, invented VR, long long before it ever came to use.

基本上是我上次说的。上一次我们看了四个系统，一个素描板，我们没有真正看过Englebart系统，但是很容易在网上找到它。我们看了第一个非常好的手势系统，GRAIL，我们看到Ivan Sutherland再次发明了VR，在它开始使用之前很久。

I really rush past  personal computers, and the first thing was kind of like a personal computer, it was  kind of cute, was Harry Huskey's Bendix G15 in the mid-50s. This was really early.  Harry just left us at a few years over the age of 100, really wonderful  guy. Here's my vote for the first real personal computer called the LINC by Wes  Clark. Wes Clark also did the building-sized computer that Sketchpad was done on, so he  liked to work both large and small. Here's one I did with Ed Cheadle, looks  kind of modern, and an idea I had in 1968 which struck me really deeply,  not because it was a tablet but because it was a thing that children needed.  I'd learned from Seymour Papert, what children could actually do with computers and that seized  me in a romantic fashion. We looked at this idea of better and perfect are  the enemy of what is actually needed.

我真的很喜欢个人电脑，第一件事就像一台个人电脑，有点可爱，是50年代中期哈里·胡斯基(Harry Huskey)的本迪克斯G15(BendixG15)。太早了。哈利在100岁以上的时候就离开了我们，真是个了不起的家伙。这是我对韦斯·克拉克的第一台真正的个人电脑“LINC”的投票。韦斯·克拉克(WesClark)还设计了Sketchpad所用的大楼大小的电脑，所以他喜欢大大小小的工作。这是我和EdCheadle一起做的，看起来有点现代，我在1968年的一个想法深深地打动了我，不是因为它是一台平板电脑，而是因为它是孩子们需要的东西。我从Seymour Papert那里学到了孩子们实际上可以用电脑做的事情，这让我以一种浪漫的方式抓住了我。我们认为，更好和更完美的想法是真正需要什么的敌人。

In other words, we have to draw thresholds  in order to know where you are, else you're just measuring local variations. You don't  know whether they're good or bad. The last thing we did on Tuesday was looking  at this process of taking a glimmer of an idea out 30 or more years  to see if it makes more sense 30 years from now than it seems to  now, and if it does, you bring it back, simulate it by making supercomputers that  allow you to do the software, and five or eight years later, you've got something  that will revolutionize the world. This is where trillions rather than billions comes in, because  you create an industry. Last time, I didn't get a chance to show you just  one of the examples of what PARC did, so I thought I'd do it. Today,  and this is a self-portrait, because now I have extracted stuff from a demo, but  this is system we brought back to life from 1978. This is a self-portrait, so  this is the successor to the Alto, called the Dorado, so it had now a  bigger than XVGA screen, rather than the portrait model. This dithering technique was invented at  the same time in the 70s by Bob Floyd and Steinberg, and partly done at  PARC. This is what a typical image on only a few computers in the world  looked like back then, one bit per point. Where do we get this system from?  Well, here's the Xerox dump, and if you look closely there, there's a disk pack.  Actually got Xerox throughout most of the disk packs of the work that was done  at Xerox PARC. A few of them got rescued. Here it is, a few hundred  files on there. One of them happened to be most of a system that we  did in 1978, and it's of partial interest because the next year, it was the  stuff that Steve Jobs got shown during his famous visit too. You have a little  flavor here. Now what we did is, we brought this back to live, and it  was relatively easy because this system is called "Smalltalk-78", is a pure object system, and  so it resembles the internet. This is an internet self-portrait, and it's just as good  a self-portrait of Smalltalk because the idea was to have the one-to-one correspondence between the  idea of little logical computers, which is what we called objects, that could send messages  around and make an entire system.

换句话说，我们必须画出阈值才能知道你在哪里，否则你只是在测量局部变化。你不知道他们是好是坏。我们周二所做的最后一件事就是观察这个过程，从30年或更长的时间里寻找出一个想法的微光，看看30年后是否比现在看起来更有意义，如果有，你会把它带回来，通过制造超级计算机来模拟它，让你可以做这个软件，五八年后，你有会彻底改变世界的东西。这是数万亿，而不是数十亿，因为你创造了一个行业。上一次，我没有机会向你们展示Parc所做的事情中的一个，所以我想我应该这么做。今天，这是一幅自画像，因为现在我已经从一个演示中提取了一些东西，但是这是我们从1978年开始复活的系统。这是一个自画像，所以这是阿尔托，被称为多拉多，所以它现在有一个更大的XVGA屏幕，而不是肖像模型。这种抖动技术是在70年代由鲍勃·弗洛伊德和斯坦伯格发明的，部分是在帕尔克发明的。这是当时世界上只有少数几台计算机上的典型图像，每点一位。我们从哪里得到这个系统？好吧，这是施乐转储，如果你仔细看，有一个磁盘包。实际上，施乐在Xerox Parc上完成的工作的大部分磁盘包中都有施乐。他们中有几个获救了。在这里，几百个文件在那里。其中之一恰好是1978年我们所做的系统中的大部分，这是部分感兴趣的，因为第二年，史蒂夫·乔布斯在他著名的访问中也得到了展示。你这里有点味道。现在我们做的是，我们把它带回了生活，这是相对容易的，因为这个系统被称为“Smalltalk-78”，是一个纯粹的对象系统，所以它类似于互联网。这是一张网络自画像，它也是Smalltalk的自我写照，因为它的想法是在小逻辑计算机的概念之间进行一对一的通信，这就是我们所称的对象，它可以在周围发送信息，形成一个完整的系统。

It's a little different then from what you think  object-orienting programming is today. One of the consequences is that there are no actual applications  because you can mix and match objects as you choose. Here we see something that  is vaguely familiar. Thought I'd turned that off. Okay, so this is a typical screen  back then, and it ran on the Alto there, the portable Notetaker and the Dorado.  Here's a bitmap painting I did 45 years ago that we found and stuck in  here. See the user interface is with the object itself, and here I'm marking it  up.

这和你认为面向对象的编程有一点不同。其后果之一是没有实际的应用程序，因为您可以根据您的选择混合和匹配对象。在这里，我们看到了一些模糊熟悉的东西。我以为我把它关掉了。好的，这是一个典型的屏幕，它运行在阿尔托那里，便携记事本和多拉多。这是我45年前画的一幅位图，我们在这里找到并卡在这里。请参阅用户界面与对象本身，这里我正在标记它。

It has a character recognizer, just a recognizer like GRAIL did. There, it's recognizing  I want an arrow and making one. The overlapping windows, the icons, what would be  rich text today, and you can see the gesture recognizer is being used to tell  it how to justify. This system is organized in terms of projects, so each project  you can think of in today's terms as a separate desktop. They persist over time.  Now think about this compared to the user interface today where you use an application  that doesn't every feature that you want, and you start and stop applications and try  and cut and paste between them. Here what you have is just working spaces, an  unlimited desk for every project that you have, you can have as many, they persist  over time, because this is a workflow idea. We couldn't get Apple to adopt this  idea. These are kind of thumbnails of each one of them, we can go into  one of them. Here's a little thing done by a 13-year-old girl writing an article  for Creative Computing back in 1975. You can see, it's sort of like desktop publishing,  but in fact, any object can be used in here, and so for example, if  we look here, she's telling about how she uses the computer and how she's typing  in there. She's typing in code and it's being executed to grow the box and  turn the box and so forth. Get the idea? It'd be nice if Wikipedia had  even thought about this, because imagine, you go to the article on Logo, guess what?  You can't execute Logo code in there. Why? It's on a computer. What didn't they  get about computing? Well, pretty much everything.

它有一个字符识别器，就像GRAIL那样的识别器。在那里，它认识到我想要一支箭，然后做一支箭。重叠的窗口，图标，今天将是丰富的文本，你可以看到手势识别器正被用来告诉它如何对齐。这个系统是按照项目来组织的，所以你可以用今天的术语把每个项目想象成一个独立的桌面。它们久而久之。现在想一想，与现在的用户界面相比，您使用的应用程序并不是所有您想要的功能，您可以启动和停止应用程序，并尝试在它们之间剪切和粘贴。这里你拥有的只是工作空间，你拥有的每一个项目都有一个无限的办公桌，你可以拥有尽可能多的工作空间，它们会随着时间的推移而持续存在，因为这是一个工作流的想法。我们无法让苹果采纳这个想法。这是他们每一个的缩略图，我们可以进入其中之一。这是一位13岁的女孩在1975年为创意计算写的一篇文章所做的一件小事。你可以看到，这有点像桌面出版，但事实上，任何物体都可以在这里使用，例如，如果我们看看这里，她告诉我们她是如何使用计算机的，以及她是如何在那里打字的。她正在输入代码，并且正在执行它来增长盒子和转动盒子等等。明白了吗？如果维基百科能想到这一点，那就太好了，因为想象一下，你会在Logo上看到这篇文章，你猜怎么着？你不能在里面执行Logo代码。为什么?在电脑上。他们对计算有什么不了解的？嗯，几乎所有的事情。

If you look at it closely, you'll see  the web design and the web browser are two of the worst things ever done  in computing, because they fail to take account of the fact that you're actually on  a computer. Another example here is an animation system. You notice that ball is not  squashing there, and it would look better if the ball squashed when it hit.

如果你仔细观察，你会发现网页设计和网络浏览器是计算史上最糟糕的两件事，因为它们没有考虑到你实际上是在一台计算机上。这里的另一个例子是动画系统。你注意到那个球不是压在那里的，如果球打的时候被压扁的话，它看起来会更好。

If  this were a normal system and it didn't have that feature, we'd be done, but  we can relate objects to each other. Here we're single-stepping to get to that frame  that we'd like to change. We're looking at the interface of this bouncing guy and  we're seeing, "Oh yeah, there's a thing called 'current frame', that's what this thing is."  Here's our painting window, and let's look at its interface. Here's something that allows me  to set the picture in there, and I want to connect the two windows together,  so I use the gesture recognizer to draw a line between them.

如果这是一个正常的系统，而且它没有这个特性，我们就可以完成，但是我们可以将对象彼此关联起来。在这里，我们一步到达我们想要改变的框架。我们看着这个弹跳的家伙的界面，我们看到，“哦，是的，有一个叫做‘当前帧’的东西，这就是这个东西。”这是我们的绘画窗口，让我们看看它的界面。这里有一些东西可以让我在里面设置图片，我想把这两个窗口连接在一起，所以我用手势识别器在它们之间画了一条线。

It gives me  a little place to explain how I'd like to relate them, and I say, "Well,  the painter's picture wants to be the bouncing animation's current frame." Everybody get what's going  on here? I say, "Go ahead and do that," and now it's latched onto that  thing that's there. Now I can start the animation going again, but while it's going,  I can paint, look carefully and you'll see that the thing is being painted while  it's running. Wouldn't you like to be able to do that today? Just think about,  why not? This is like Sketchpad, except a few years later. Yeah. This is completely  natural, it's what you get very very easily if you just have unlimited objects.

它给了我一个小地方来解释我想把它们联系起来，我说，“嗯，画家的画想成为弹跳动画的当前框架。”大家都明白这是怎么回事吗？我说，“去做吧”，现在它被锁在那里的那个东西上了。现在我可以重新启动动画了，但是当它在运行的时候，我可以画，仔细看，你会发现它运行时正在绘制。你今天不想这么做吗？想想，为什么不呢？这就像Sketchpad，除了几年后。嗯这是完全自然的，这是你很容易得到的东西，如果你有无限的物体。

In  this particular thing gives you automatically something much more powerful than PowerPoint, because all you  have to do is sequence these things called projects or the desktops. That's what I'm  doing here, just moving from one to another. That's an example of what happened at  PARC, and if we go back to this screen of the various inventions there, we  can look at, now I'm answering Sam's question, how much of the Alto idea actually  made it out of Xerox PARC? Well, about half. We'll see what the other half  is in a second. How about the GUI? Well, about 70%, because you notice the  GUI didn't come out as something that has this unlimited desktop idea. Even today, 30  some odd years after this, nobody has put it in there.

在这个特定的东西中，你会自动得到比PowerPoint更强大的东西，因为你所要做的就是排列这些被称为项目或桌面的东西。这就是我在这里做的，只是从一个搬到另一个。这就是在Parc发生的一个例子，如果我们回到这个屏幕上的各种发明，我们可以看看，现在我在回答Sam的问题，阿尔托的想法到底有多少是用施乐Parc来实现的？嗯，大约一半。我们马上看看另一半是什么。GUI怎么样？嗯，大约70%，因为你注意到图形用户界面并没有作为有这种无限桌面想法的东西出现。即使到了今天，在这之后的30多年里，也没有人把它放进去。

It's ridiculous, but it  has to do with people wanting to have applications and sell applications, even though most  applications won't do all the things that you need. How about desktop publishing? About 70%  for the same reason. The way we did programming, only about 10% has come out,  and I won't go into all the differences, but I think you've seen some of  them. Laser printer, about 90%. Post script, 100%, and that's partly because the guys who  did this at PARC formed Adobe, Geschke and Warnock. They sold as in their company  what it was, how they thought you should be able to do printing. 100% of  the ethernet, there was no competitor. About 50% of peer-peer and client server, we'll see  why in a second. 100% of the internet, again there was no competitor for it.  One way of looking at this is, what came out most successfully were the things  for which people already out there didn't think they already knew how to do it.  Everybody knew how to program, and so the biggest resistance was in how we did  programming. That just didn't make it. Here's three things that I didn't mention before because  none of them made it, but one of them was, hey, the architecture of the  Alto was revolutionary, and it allowed you to run very high level languages very efficiently  and to make changes on the fly. We tried with Intel and Motorola to get  them to adopt these architectures for the chip, and zero.

这是荒谬的，但这与人们想要拥有应用程序和销售应用程序有关，即使大多数应用程序不会做你需要的所有事情。桌面出版怎么样？同样的原因，大约有70%。我们编程的方式，只有大约10%已经出来了，我不会讨论所有的差异，但是我想你们已经看到了其中的一些。激光打印机，大约90%。PostScript，100%，这部分是因为在Parc做这件事的人组成了Adobe、Geschke和Warnock。他们在公司里卖的是什么，他们认为你应该如何印刷。100%的以太网，没有竞争对手。大约50%的对等服务器和客户端服务器，我们将在一秒钟内看到原因。100%的互联网，同样没有竞争对手。有一种观点认为，最成功的是那些人们认为他们已经不知道该如何去做的事情。每个人都知道如何编程，所以最大的阻力在于我们是如何编程的。只是没能成功。这里有三件事我之前没有提到，因为他们都没有做到，但其中之一是，嘿，阿尔托的架构是革命性的，它允许你运行非常高水平的语言，非常高效地进行更改。我们曾与英特尔和摩托罗拉一起尝试让他们采用这些芯片的架构，而零。

Intel especially at the time  didn't know anything about computing, didn't know anything about programming, and didn't want to learn.  They had to be dragged kicking and screaming even to do CPUs. Andy Grove, for  instance, was against the first CPU on a chip that Intel did. The idea of  the Dynabook didn't make it out.

当时的英特尔对计算一无所知，对编程一无所知，也不想学习。他们不得不被拖，踢和尖叫，甚至要做CPU。例如，安迪·格罗夫(AndyGrove)反对英特尔的芯片上的第一个CPU。达纳博克的想法并没有成功。

If you think about it, when did the iPad  decide to put a stylus and a keyboard on the iPad? The iPad Pro. Why  couldn't they do it? What was their problem? 10% of that idea came out. Here's  an interesting idea to think about. Here we've got the internet of machines connected together,  and if your programming language happens to be a software internet, like Smalltalk was, then  you can map the objects into the network, and you can migrate the objects around.  Each object is self-contained, they do messaging, the messaging is either done internally or it  goes out on the internet, and so you have a solution for all the different  scalings of computing that you have, whether it's a small device. Yes?
Students: Why did you say only 10% of the Dynabook? What's so important about the stylus  and the keyboard?
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing. Two-year-olds use this, and 92-year-olds use this. Everybody else uses tools  for dealing with media. When Steve decided not to do styluses, he completely went away,  all he was doing was selling sugar water to babies. He was not selling something,  for instance, that any artist can draw on. He sent me the first iPad for  my comments on the thing, and the first thing I did was go out and  get a capacitive stylus and draw lines with a ruler on, I guess it was  Autodesk, one of the Autodesk software that was pretty good.

想想看，iPad是什么时候决定在iPad上安装手写笔和键盘的？iPad Pro。为什么他们不能这么做？他们有什么问题？10%的想法都出来了。这里有一个有趣的想法值得考虑。在这里，我们把机器的互联网连接在一起，如果你的编程语言碰巧是一个软件互联网，像Smalltalk那样，那么你可以把这些对象映射到网络中，然后你可以迁移到周围的对象。每个对象都是独立的，它们进行消息传递，消息传递要么在内部完成，要么在互联网上发布，因此您可以为所有不同规模的计算提供解决方案，无论它是一个小型设备。是学生：你为什么说只有10%的Dynabook？笔和键盘有什么重要的？演讲者1：嗯，事情是这样的。两岁的孩子用这个，92岁的孩子用这个。其他人都使用工具来处理媒体。当史蒂夫决定不做手写笔时，他完全离开了，他所做的只是卖糖水给婴儿。例如，他不是在卖任何艺术家可以借鉴的东西。他给我发了第一台iPad来征求我对这件事的评论，我做的第一件事就是出去拿一个电容式触控笔，用尺子画线，我想是Autodesk，一个很好的Autodesk软件。

I determined that the touch-sensitivity  on the iPad was fabulous, despite the fact that it's done in a very, very  complex way.

我认为ipad上的触控灵敏度是惊人的，尽管它是以非常复杂的方式完成的。

It has to find centroids from wide things on it, but it was  done extremely well and I got very linear results on it.

它必须从它上面的宽物体上找到质心，但是它做得非常好，我得到了非常线性的结果。

It was there to  do, but there was no place to put on the stylus on the iPad, and  long long ago, remember I showed you a tablet system from the mid-60s, 50 years  ago. We had a perfect chance to decide by experiment whether a purely stylus-driven system  was actually enough to do the work that you wanted to do, and the answer  is no. Similarly with Englebart, you could do every piece of text entry without using  the keyboard, but they had a keyboard there because you just can't do it fast  enough for being able to put in large amounts of text. You need to have  a keyboard.

这是要做的，但没有地方可以放在iPad上的触控笔，很久以前，记得我给你看了一个60年代中期，50年前的平板电脑系统。我们有一个完美的机会通过实验来决定一个纯粹由手写笔驱动的系统是否足以完成你想做的工作，答案是否定的。与Englebart类似，您可以在不使用键盘的情况下完成所有的文本输入，但是他们有一个键盘，因为您不能以足够快的速度输入大量的文本。你需要一个键盘。

Students: tools for experts, by experts, like Englebart.

学生：专家的工具，专家，像恩格尔巴特。

Speaker 1: Well, so here's the thing that Englebart said. They said, "Why do you have to  learn your system?" Back then, he said, "People are going to use their computers for  six to eight hours a day," and they laughed at him. What you guys are  doing, "Do, do, do, do," is using your computers for six to eight hours a  day and using interfaces that are made for a couple of seconds a day.

演讲者1：嗯，下面是恩格尔巴特说的话。他们说：“你为什么要学习你的系统？”当时，他说，“人们每天要用6到8个小时的电脑，”他们嘲笑他。你们正在做的，“做，做”，是每天使用你的电脑6到8个小时，并使用几秒钟一天的接口。

If  that isn't the most ridiculous thing you've ever ...

如果这不是你见过的最荒谬的事.。

It's about as ridiculous as this  building.

就像这栋楼一样荒谬。

If you think about it as a user interface. You come in the door  and there's a stairway and there's no map. "Where am I, where can I go,  and Jesus, this looks like a dungeon." Remember, computer-human interface is part of what you're  supposed to learn about, and you can't do it in a dump like this. You  have to have some sense of design around, and I'm not sure you can do  software without having some sense of design around.

如果你认为它是一个用户界面。你进了门，就有了楼梯，没有地图。“我在哪里，我能去哪里，耶稣，这看上去像个地牢。”记住，电脑-人机界面是你应该学习的东西的一部分，你不能在这样的垃圾堆里这样做。你必须有一定的设计意识，而我不确定你是否能够在没有设计意识的情况下完成软件工作。

I won't make any really rude remarks.  Just to use up time I don't have, I should point out that, some of  this migrating object idea was done at PARC, a really great followup was done by  a visitor to PARC, Jerry Popek, who then was at UCLA, went back to UCLA  and did a fabulous system using Unix as the base called Locus, L-O-C-U-S, and if  you're interested in a future that will at some point actually happen, you can get  that book from MIT Press, and particularly the first couple of chapters of that book  outline what the issues are for dealing with real scaling on the internet.

我不会说任何粗鲁的话。为了浪费我没有的时间，我要指出的是，一些迁移对象的想法是在Parc完成的，Parc的访问者Jerry Popek(当时在UCLA)做了一个非常棒的后续工作，他回到了UCLA，并使用unix做了一个非常棒的系统，名为Locus，L-O-C-U-S，如果你对未来感兴趣的话。在某一时刻，你可以从麻省理工学院出版社得到这本书，特别是这本书的前几章概述了在互联网上如何处理真正的扩展问题。

I won't  go further than that. Zero. Principle 21, "Reality is a low-pass filter." You have to  have enormous ideas so that people not understanding them will retain something. You don't want  to have the low-pass filter give you back a dial tone. That happens, because most  ideas are mediocre down to bad, even by people who have good ideas. Those are  the ones that you don't want to work on, because if you're successful on them,  they're still going to get peeled down. Here's a book.

我不会再往前走了。零。原则21，“现实是一个低通滤波器.”你必须有巨大的想法，这样人们不理解他们就会保留一些东西。你不想让低通滤波器给你回拨音。这是会发生的，因为大多数想法都是平庸到糟糕的，即使是那些有好主意的人也是如此。这些是你不想做的，因为如果你成功的话，它们还是会被剥掉的。这是一本书。

I put this slide up  here for Sam, because Sam reads books. You people probably don't, but this is not  a book about Xerox PARC, Sam. This is a book by an executive at Xerox  written in the '60s, before PARC, about trying to get the Xerox machine adopted. This  was after Xerox had been the fastest-growing ... One of the companies that turned down  the complete rights for a licensing fee to the Xerox machine was IBM. That story  is in this book.

我把这张幻灯片放在这里是为了山姆，因为山姆看书。你们可能不知道，但这不是一本关于施乐帕尔的书，山姆。这是施乐公司的一位高管在60年代写的一本书，写于Parc之前，讲述的是如何让施乐机器被采用。这是在施乐成为增长最快的公司之后…其中一家公司拒绝了施乐机器获得许可费的全部权利，那就是IBM。这本书中就有这样的故事。

IBM's consultant said, "This isn't going to work because there's no  market for plain paper copying, because people are not copying." Well, of course, it wasn't  a good copier back then.

IBM的顾问说，“这是行不通的，因为没有市场的普通纸张复制，因为人们没有复制。”当然，那时候不是个好复印机。

I could write a book, "Our Years With Xerox: The  Trillions Nobody Wanted".

我可以写一本书，“我们在施乐的岁月：没有人想要的万亿美元”。

I didn't have time to make a picture that looks like John  Dessauer.

我没时间拍一张像约翰·德索尔的照片。

It doesn't matter, and I'm going to try and explain to you in the  time I have left, why the goodness of an idea is almost irrelevant. Now for  the reality kit. Get out your reality kit, and we're going to deal with the  top. Let's break the seal and just open up the thing. This will work best  if you put it down on your thing like this. Look at the instructions. For  people online ... Did you get a reality kit? Okay. Everybody got one? What happened?  Where were you? Boy. Hey, you know what? You guys must have been late. Take  them, hand them out to ... Anybody else? Okay. You're killing me, guys. Okay, so,  cover your right eye, look at the plus with your left eye, and then slowly  the move thing in, keeping focused on the plus until something happens. Move slow, slow  as in the word "slow". Who's seeing something? What do you see?
Students: Disappears in our blind spot.

这并不重要，在我离开的时候，我会试着向你们解释，为什么一个想法的好处几乎是无关紧要的。现在是现实工具包。拿出你的现实装备，我们要对付最高层。我们打破封印，把东西打开。如果你把它放在这样的东西上，这会是最好的。看说明书。网上的人.。你拿到现实包了吗？好的。每个人都有吗？发生了什么?你当时在哪？男孩嘿，你知道吗？你们一定迟到了。带上他们，把他们送到.还有其他人吗？好的。你们要杀了我伙计们。好的，所以，盖上你的右眼，用你的左眼看这个正片，然后慢慢移动它，把注意力集中在加号上，直到有什么事情发生为止。慢慢来，就像“慢”一词。谁看到什么了？你看到什么？学生：消失在我们的盲点。

Speaker 1: Disappears in our blind ... Everybody seeing that? Don't say yes if you're not. This  is a good thing for everybody, particularly in computing, to do once a day. Okay,  so, now let me ask you, what do you see where the dot was? Nothing?
Students: Blur.

消失在我们的瞎子里.。大家都看到了吗？如果你不是，就别答应。这对每个人来说都是件好事，尤其是在计算方面，每天做一次。好吧，那么，现在让我问你，你看到点在哪里了吗？没什么学生：模糊。

Speaker 1: What?
Students: Text.

演讲者1：什么？学生：课文。

Speaker 1: You see text. How could that be?
Students: The brain's algorithm fills in the spot with what it thinks it should see.

演讲者1：你看到文字了。怎么可能呢?学生：大脑的算法充满了它认为应该看到的东西。

It  fills in the spot with what the surroundings are.

它充满了周围的环境。

Speaker 1: Why?
Students: That's what it expects.

演讲者1：为什么？学生们：这就是它所期望的。

Speaker 1: Okay, but here's what's happening here. You see something like this, right? What's happening is  inside your eye, I wonder if I've got a laser, yeah, over here is where  the blood vessels come through, so we have a very badly designed eye.

演讲者1：好吧，但这里发生的事情是这样的。你看到这样的东西了，对吧？正在发生的事情发生在你的眼睛里，我想知道我是否有激光，是的，这里是血管通过的地方，所以我们的眼睛设计得很差。

If you're  arguing with a Creationist, this is a good argument against God here, because if there  was a God, he gave squids a great eye and he gave us a bad  one. Our eye happens to have the blood vessels in front of the light-detecting cells,  and so our brain has to filter out all of those also. Over here is  where most of your acuity is, in an area called the fovea. When the thing  is further away, you get something like this, and when you move in, at some  point the dot gets over where there are no light-sensitive cells at all and you  can't see it anymore. As my friend over here said, somehow the brain fills it  in. We'll look at that in a second. Principle number 22 is, we have a  blind spot in our eyes that our brain makes up stuff to fill in.

如果你和一个造物主争论，这是一个反对上帝的很好的论点，因为如果有上帝，他给了乌贼一只大眼睛，而他给了我们一只坏眼睛。我们的眼睛碰巧在光探测细胞前面有血管，所以我们的大脑也必须过滤掉所有这些。这里是你最敏锐的地方，在一个叫做凹的地方。当物体离我们更远的时候，你会得到这样的东西，当你移动的时候，这个点就会过去，那里根本就没有光敏细胞，你再也看不见它了。就像我在这里的朋友说的，不知何故大脑会填满它。我们一会儿再看。第22条原则是，我们的眼睛里有一个盲点，那就是我们的大脑构成了要填补的东西。

It's  just making it up. Think about this because, what's the other case where your brain  makes up stuff that you think is real? A dream? Most people think they only  dream at night, but in fact human brains are set up so that we actually  dream ... Did you get one of these? In the old days we'd throw chalk  at you, but there is no chalk. A powerful idea about that is number 23,  is that we can't learn to see until we realize and admit that we're blind.  The biggest problem with most human beings is they don't understand that they are blind  because they think they can see. This leads to much of the trouble in the  world, and the powerful idea about that is the zeroth one again, is it makes  a huge difference if ideas are experienced in as many ways as possible.

只是在编造而已。想想这个，因为，你的大脑构成了你认为是真实的东西的另一种情况是什么？一个梦？大多数人认为他们只在晚上做梦，但事实上，人类的大脑是为了让我们梦见.你拿到这些了吗？在过去，我们会向你扔粉笔，但没有粉笔。关于这一点的一个强有力的想法是，在我们意识到并承认自己是盲人之前，我们是无法学会看的。大多数人最大的问题是，他们不明白自己是瞎子，因为他们认为自己能看见。这导致了世界上的许多麻烦，而关于这一点的强有力的想法是，如果以尽可能多的方式来体验的话，是否会产生巨大的不同。

In other  words, perspective, point of view is worth 80 IQ points. Just because something seems to  be right, and this is why math is a danger about thinking. Okay, let's go  to the poker chips now. Pry them loose. Okay, and what you're going to do  is hold them up like this, so one is about twice as far away as  the other, like that. Okay, you'll see something like this, right? On your retina is  actually something like this. Think about it.

换句话说，视角，观点值80个智商点。仅仅因为某些东西似乎是正确的，这就是为什么数学是思考的危险。好吧，我们现在去玩扑克筹码吧。把它们撬开。好的，你要做的就是像这样把他们举起来，所以其中一个离另一个大约两倍远，就像那样。好吧，你会看到这样的东西，对吧？在你的视网膜上其实是这样的。好好想想。

If it's twice as far away, it's subtending  half the angle, and therefore it should show up as half size, but it doesn't  show up as half size. We can stick these guys on a ruler, since these  poker chips are now yours, you can take it back and really science the shit  out of it. Here's what we should see, that's what's on our retina. Descartes, by  the way, got an ox eye and peeled the back of it off to see  whether biological lenses actually acted like glass lenses, and they do. Here's what's going on.  The stuff that's on your retina gets mapped into about 12 different places in your  brain. Your brain is active.

如果它的距离是它的两倍，那么它就相当于半个角度，因此它应该显示为一半大小，但它不会显示为一半大小。我们可以把这些家伙放在一把尺子上，因为这些扑克筹码现在是你的了，你可以把它拿回来，把它弄得更科学。这是我们应该看到的，那是我们视网膜上的东西。顺便说一句，笛卡尔有一只牛眼，把它的后背剥掉，看看生物镜片是否真的像玻璃镜片，它们确实如此。这是怎么回事。视网膜上的物质被映射到大脑中大约12个不同的位置。你的大脑很活跃。

In computer terms, the cells in your brain are like  the hardware, and there are processes going on, and one set of processes are all  the ones that have to do with our belief system. Before we recognize something, it  goes through our belief system, and then it goes into the real time version of  our belief system, which is called the dream. We have beliefs in the dream, and  our beliefs are, "Dammit, these things are the same size." By the way you can  do this with oranges, with quarters, anything where you know they're the same size, do  the same thing. The result of information from the actual world combined with your beliefs,  you wind up with this. Anybody here is an artist who can draw? Okay. You  must know this illusion then, it's called size constancy. Can you actually draw? Yeah. You  can draw, right? If you can actually draw, the first thing you realize is you  can't see what's going on, and so you start measuring. Hold your arm rigid, you  measure it off, so I can measure, yeah, Sam's head is that high. Wow, it's  only half size compared to this guy who's closer to me.

从计算机的角度来说，你大脑中的细胞就像硬件一样，有一些过程在进行中，而一组过程都与我们的信念系统有关。在我们认识到某一事物之前，它会通过我们的信念系统，然后进入我们信仰系统的实时版本，也就是所谓的梦想。我们有梦想的信念，我们的信念是：“该死，这些东西都是一样大小的。”顺便说一句，你可以用橘子，硬币，任何你知道它们大小相同的东西，做同样的事情。来自实际世界的信息与你的信念结合在一起的结果，你最终会得到这个结果。这里有人是会画画的艺术家吗？好的。那么，你一定知道这个错觉，它叫做大小不变。你真的会画画吗？嗯你会画画对吧？如果你真的会画画，你首先意识到的是你看不出发生了什么，所以你开始测量。坚持你的手臂僵硬，你测量它下来，所以我可以测量，是的，山姆的头是那么高。哇，和这个离我更近的家伙比起来只有一半大。

It doesn't look like  it to me, it looks like it's almost the same size because heads are the  same. Got it? Principle 24, the mind's eye is different than our sensory eye. We  do things according to the mind's eye, and most people who have ever lived on  this planet don't know that there are two different eyes, because they take the world  as it seems. They build up a common sense from the world as it seems.  This is why human beings generally cannot think. You can't think if you're doing this  stuff. Another term for beliefs is a "private universe". We each have one of our  very own.

在我看来它不像它，它看起来几乎是一样的大小，因为头部是一样的。明白了。原则24，大脑的眼睛和我们的感觉眼睛是不同的。我们用心灵的眼光来做事，而生活在这个星球上的大多数人都不知道有两只不同的眼睛，因为他们视世界为看上去的样子。从表面上看，他们从世界上建立了一种常识。这就是为什么人类一般不会思考。你不能想如果你在做这些事。信仰的另一个术语是“私人宇宙”。我们每个人都有自己的一个。

If you've ever argued with somebody you thought was reasonable up to that  point, what's happening is, your beliefs are conflicting with their beliefs. Our waking dreams are  private.

如果你曾经和你认为是合理的人争论过，那么现在发生的事情是，你的信念和他们的信仰是冲突的。我们清醒的梦是私人的。

I love this phrase. This is a new phrase, "alternate truths", Kellyanne Conway. That's  what's going on. You can see why being a scientist is tough. The scientist has  to get around all of this crap that our brain is throwing up. Okay, so,  a quick easy model is how randomness is, is a little bit of rainwater on  dirt, dislodges a few crumbs of dirt and a little gully happens, and the gully  is more efficient at routing water, so things start happening. Just where things started happening  originally, you get something like this. Completely random, it could have gone anyway. You make  a whole world out of it. Here's a world that's completely pink, if you've ever  been in the Grand Canyon, it is just almost overwhelming.

我喜欢这句话。这是一个新的短语，“另一个真理”，凯莉安·康维(Kellyanne Conway)。这就是发生的事。你可以理解为什么做科学家很难。科学家得绕开我们脑子里吐出来的这些垃圾。好的，一个简单的快速模型是这样的：随机性是这样的：在泥土上有一点雨水，把几块灰尘和一些沟壑移开，然后沟渠更有效地输送水，所以事情就开始发生了。“。就在事情开始发生的地方，你会得到这样的东西。完全是随机的，反正它也有可能消失。你用它创造了一个完整的世界。这是一个完全粉红的世界，如果你曾经去过大峡谷，它几乎是压倒性的。

If you look up, you  have to remember to look up, there's a little bit of blue sky up above.  The problem with human beings is we don't look up. We look out. Here's an  example. That's pretty washed out, but that's a pink plane, and our thoughts are like  ants crawling over it. We can think about things, we can make progress, we can  run into an obstacle, we can get around the obstacle, and so forth, but everything  we're doing here is pink except we don't know it's pink because we've never been  in anything else but pink. This is like a fish not knowing it's in water.  It's always been in water. Every once in a while, you might have a little  outlaw thought, a little blue thought, but you've been to school, you're going to Stanford,  you go to church, temple, synagogue, mosque, whatever it is, because our beliefs project out.  When we see something that isn't normal, normal is actually the same as crazy. Smash.  maybe you're out for a run, you're just waking up in the morning, you're taking  a shower, and all of a sudden, you get a, "Holy shit, holy shit, there's  a blue world, a blue world that's orthogonal to the one I'm in." Once you're  in that blue world, you realize, "Oh, there's probably a lot of them." Can you  see each one of these as a context? Can you see that what happened from  the Renaissance by Newton, to our modern age, was going from a pink plane to  a blue plain? This is what ARPA did with computing.

如果你向上看，你必须记得抬头，上面有一点蓝色的天空。人类的问题是我们不仰望。我们要小心。下面是一个例子。那是一架粉红色的飞机，我们的思想就像蚂蚁爬过它。我们可以思考，我们可以取得进展，我们可以遇到一个障碍，我们可以绕过障碍，等等，但是我们在这里所做的一切都是粉红色的，只是我们不知道它是粉色的，因为除了粉红色，我们从来没有过其他的东西。这就像一条鱼不知道它在水里。一直都在水里。每隔一段时间，你就会有一个不法之徒的想法，一个蓝色的想法，但是你去过学校，你要去斯坦福，你去教堂，庙宇，犹太教堂，清真寺，不管是什么，因为我们的信仰被抛出了。当我们看到一些不正常的东西时，正常和疯狂其实是一样的。粉碎。也许你出去跑步，早上醒来，洗个澡，突然间，你得到了一个，“天啊，天哪，有一个蓝色的世界，一个与我所处的世界正交的蓝色世界。”一旦你进入了那个蓝色的世界，你就会意识到，“哦，可能有很多这样的人。”你能把每一个都看作是背景吗？你能看到从牛顿文艺复兴到我们现代所发生的事情，是从粉红色的飞机走向蓝色的平原吗？这就是ARPA在计算方面所做的。

It went from mainframes, a  completely different way of thinking about things, to the world we have today, despite the  fact that nobody had thought of it at all.

它从大型机，一种完全不同的思考事物的方式，发展到我们今天的世界，尽管事实上根本没有人想到它。

It was considered literally crazy by  our colleagues in computing when we were doing it. Okay. Just leave the compass on  there.

当我们这样做的时候，我们的同事们认为这简直是疯了。好的。把指南针留在那里。

It's for you to remember that some people get to this really early. Einstein  was five, he was recovering from the measles, I think. His father brought him a  little compass for him to play with, and Einstein remembered later in life. He said,  "This made the most impression of me of anything in my childhood," because the way  he looked at it, "Oh, there must be something deeply hidden behind things." He didn't  take it as it came because he was worrying about, how does the needle know  where to go? There's nothing visible about it, and yet it is doing this, and  that changed Einstein's complete way of thinking about things. When a baby is born, when  we are born, we're not born into nothing. We're born into a culture. Most cultures  over the last hundred-plus, thousands of years were traditional cultures, hunting and gathering cultures. Traditional  cultures don't know that they are inside a particular outlook. Traditional cultures think they're in  reality. They react incredibly strongly to other people's versions of reality, to the point of  war. This is what are genes give rise to, and many people today including in  our country are born into this pretty natural way of looking at things. We had  to invent the idea of outlook. Well, here's another one.

你应该记住，有些人很早就到了。爱因斯坦五岁，他正在从麻疹中恢复，我想。他的父亲给他带来了一个小指南针供他玩，爱因斯坦记得后来的生活。他说，“这给我留下了最深刻的印象，在我的童年，”因为他看它的方式，“哦，一定有一个深刻的隐藏在背后的东西。”他不认为它是来的，因为他担心的是，针怎么知道去哪里呢？它什么都看不见，但它却在这样做，这改变了爱因斯坦对事物的完整思考方式。当婴儿出生时，当我们出生时，我们就不会一无所有。我们出生在一种文化中。在过去的一百多年里，大多数文化都是传统文化，狩猎和采集文化。传统文化不知道他们是在一个特定的观点。传统文化认为它们是现实的。他们对其他人对现实的看法有着极其强烈的反应，对战争的意义也是如此。这就是基因产生的原因，今天很多人，包括我们国家的人，都是以这种非常自然的方式看待事物的。我们不得不发明观点。这是另一个。

If you happen to be  born here, you can have the same baby and bring it up here, the baby  will grow into being French, French in its outlook, French in language, and so forth.  Here's a big idea. What happens when books got invented? A guy by the name  of Marshall McLuhan asked the question, "What are books? What is writing as an environment?"  If you thought of writing as being brought up in France, what would that actually  mean to the human race? It turns out, it's profound. Take a look at it  if you're interested. He also asked, "What is media as an environment?" For example, what  is this as an environment 24-7? Think about it. Not that the kids are being  told to shoot people, but the problem is, they're seeing shooting people as normal, because  what environments do is to take things and normalize them. They make them into part  of reality and make things thinkable. They don't say what to do, and of course  media that we have today is doing exactly the same thing, and most people don't  realize. Okay, so, unhook the last flap here. There's a little desktop here, tabletop. Look  at the picture there first and before you start experimenting, let me make an assertion  that the tops of the tables are exactly the same shapes.

如果你碰巧出生在这里，你可以生同样的孩子并在这里抚养它，孩子会成长为法语，语言等等。这是个好主意。当书被发明时会发生什么？一个叫马歇尔·麦克卢汉的人问了这个问题：“什么是书？作为一个环境，写作是什么？”如果你认为写作是在法国长大的，那对人类到底意味着什么呢？事实证明，它是深刻的。如果你感兴趣的话，看一看。他还问：“什么是媒体作为一个环境？”例如，作为一个24-7的环境，这是什么？好好想想。这并不是说孩子们被告知要开枪，但问题是，他们认为射击是正常的，因为环境所做的就是把事情处理好，并使他们正常化。它们使它们成为现实的一部分，并使事物成为可想象的。他们没有说该做什么，当然，我们今天拥有的媒体也在做同样的事情，而大多数人并没有意识到这一点。好的，把这里最后一个襟翼松开。这里有个小台式机，桌面。先看看这张图，在你开始实验之前，让我断言桌子的顶部形状是完全相同的。

I've been doing this  hundreds of times and I can't see it, but if I take my plastic thing  and move it over there ...

我已经做了几百次了，我看不见，但是如果我拿着我的塑料东西，把它移到那边去.

Students: That's crazy.

学生：太疯狂了。

Speaker 1: Yeah. No, it isn't crazy, we are crazy.

演讲者1：是的。不，这不是疯狂，我们是疯了。

If you remember nothing else from this  course, remember that the natural state of humanity is to be crazy, because crazy is  not having good models in our mind for what's going on out there. We just  draw the line at certain kinds of crazy, but we're actually crazy. This is a  really good one, isn't it? Happens to have been first done here at Stanford, this  guy is Roger Shepard, and his book is full of these. Good. Last couple of,  yeah, I think I'll get through. Anthropologists over the last 120 years or so studied  several thousand traditional cultures and wrote down properties of these cultures that were never absent.  If a single culture out of several thousand did not have a trait, then that  trait was removed. All of these traits are thought of as human universals, virtually all  of them are genetic. Here's a book. You know, books are actually useful.

如果你从这门课中什么也不记得，记住人类的自然状态是疯狂的，因为疯狂在我们的头脑中没有好的模式来描述正在发生的事情。我们只是在某种程度上的疯狂，但我们实际上是疯了。这个真的很好，不是吗？碰巧是在斯坦福大学，这个家伙是罗杰·谢泼德，他的书里充满了这些。好的最后几个，是的，我想我会挺过去的。在过去的120多年里，人类学家研究了几千种传统文化，并写下了这些文化的特性。如果几千人中的一种文化没有一个特征，那么这个特征就被删除了。所有这些特征都被认为是人类的共性，实际上它们都是遗传的。这是一本书。你知道，书其实是有用的。

It's another  good one to read.

这是另一本好读物。

Students: This is a great book.

学生们：这是一本很棒的书。

Speaker 1: Yeah.

演讲者1：是的。

I became very friendly with Sam when I noticed I could not mention a  book to him that he would not have read the next time I saw him.  That's how you know he's a good guy. Okay, so the basic idea is, genetics  drives culture. Genetics has the precursors, the desires, and culture fills in the parameters. You  can think of these, they're all category names. Once that list was made, people got  interested in things that were not in every culture. This is a partial list of  those. Agriculture had to be invented.

当我注意到我不能向他提起一本书时，我对他变得非常友好，因为下次我见到他时，他是不会看的。所以你才知道他是个好人。好吧，所以基本思想是，基因驱动文化。遗传学有先驱者，欲望，和文化填补参数。你可以想到这些，它们都是类别名称。一旦这份清单被列出来，人们就会对并非每一种文化都感兴趣的事物感兴趣。这是一份部分清单。农业必须发明。

It was a pretty easy invention, but it was  only invented about 12,000 years ago, out of several hundred thousand years of us being  on the planet.

这是一个相当容易的发明，但它是在大约12000年前发明的，它是我们在地球上几十万年前发明的。

Initially, it was a hard thing for hunting and gathering people to  think about. Like every animal, we have zillions of genes to help us cope with  things. We can deal with hardship, like every animal, incredibly, but the idea of progress  had to be invented.

最初，这是一个很难的事情，狩猎和收集人的思考。就像每一种动物一样，我们有成千上万的基因来帮助我们应对事物。我们可以像每一个动物一样，难以置信地处理困难，但是进步的想法必须被发明出来。

It's really an invention of the 18th century. The reason is  that, for almost all of human existence, people died in the same world that they  were born into. Almost nothing happened, and so what you had to do to get  from birth to death was to cope.

这真的是18世纪的发明。原因是，在人类几乎所有的存在中，人们都死在他们出生的同一个世界里。几乎什么都没发生，所以从出生到死亡，你必须做的就是应付。

It's only been recently that the idea of,  "No, we can shape the world to be better." That's a new idea. These are  all powerful ideas. Oral language versus writing and reading, the differences are profound. Stories, superstition,  religion and magic, versus the representation systems of science. News. Remember, news never introduces a  new category. What you hear about is, "Oh, it's this forest fire, it's that war,  it's this murder, it's this kind deed." This is why news can happen so quickly.  That's what our mind craves. What we hate is categories, because it can take us  a couple of years to learn the category. You never hear any news about calculus.  It takes a couple of years to learn it and there aren't enough people. Fast  thinking versus slow thinking. Differences over similarities. This is one of the reasons why most  programming languages go bad and the web browser went bad, whereas a modern way of  thinking about things is similarities over differences, emphasizes similarities.

直到最近才有这样的想法：“不，我们可以把世界塑造得更好。”这是个新主意。这些都是强有力的想法。口头语言与写作和阅读的区别是深刻的。故事，迷信，宗教和魔法，相对于科学的表现系统。新闻。记住，新闻从来没有引入一个新的类别。你听到的是，“哦，这是森林大火，是那场战争，这是一场谋杀，这是一种行为。”这就是为什么新闻发生得这么快的原因。这就是我们的思想所渴望的。我们讨厌的是类别，因为我们需要花几年的时间来学习这个类别。你从来没听过任何关于微积分的消息。它花了几年的时间来学习，而且没有足够的人。快速思考与缓慢思考。异同点而非相似之处。这就是为什么大多数编程语言都会变坏，Web浏览器会变坏的原因之一，而现代思考事物的方式是相似而不是差异，强调相似性。

It has many things to do  also with equal rights and democracy. Vendetta and revenge, those are the favorite movies, and  the favorite video games are revenge games, personal revenge games where the system has gone  and somebody has to break the law to put things right. We just love that  trope, but in fact, the whole legal system was set up in order to avoid  thousand-year feuds and vendettas. We can think of this side, we have things that human  beings want. A simple way of thinking about them is, every single one of them  on this side is a legal drug, and for people in this class who are  trying to make money by being entrepreneurs, just make a technological amplifier for any of  these things that we crave genetically. Look at the things that are there. Hunting and  gathering, social language, like the telephone. Stories, news, theater, all of those things. That's your  list. Just get this book. Right, Sam? Make something that will make people worse, and  they'll buy the hell out of it, because we don't have any natural ... All  of these things are in shortage in the world that human beings have been into  except for a couple hundred years ago. Over here we have things that human beings  need, and you can't really see, but these are terribly difficult to learn because they're  not particularly genetically prepared for. They had to be invented. Last shot here, 21st century,  going out of the 22nd century. Hey, we're not born into France or traditional society  anymore. We're born into a universe that is unbelievably large, a planet that most people  don't even realize we're on yet. Not just our social system of a few hundred  people that we know, but millions of social systems and billions of people. A technological  system that is starting to touch everybody in many many different ways. For instance, modern  medicine really dates from only World War II. That's a long time ago for you  folks, but it's within my lifetime.

它还有许多与平等权利和民主有关的事情。复仇和复仇，这些都是最受欢迎的电影，而最喜欢的电子游戏是复仇游戏，个人复仇游戏，在这个系统已经消失的地方，必须有人违法才能纠正一切。我们只是喜欢这种说法，但事实上，整个法律体系的建立是为了避免一千年的不和复仇。我们可以想到这一面，我们有人类想要的东西。一个简单的想法是，这一边的每一个人都是一种合法的药物，而对于这类试图通过企业家赚钱的人来说，只要为我们基因上渴望的任何东西制造一个技术放大器就行了。看看那里的东西。打猎和采集，社交语言，就像电话。故事，新闻，戏剧，所有这些。这是你的名单。把这本书拿来。对吧萨姆？制造一些会让人更糟的东西，他们会买下它，因为我们没有任何天然的.除了几百年前，世界上所有这些东西都是人类所缺乏的。在这里，我们有人类需要的东西，你看不见，但这些东西很难学习，因为它们没有特别的基因准备。它们必须被发明出来。最后一次拍摄，21世纪，走出22世纪。嘿，我们已经不是出生在法国或传统社会了。我们出生在一个大得令人难以置信的宇宙里，一个大多数人还没有意识到我们在上面的星球。不仅仅是我们所认识的几百人的社会制度，还有数百万的社会制度和数十亿的人。一个技术系统开始以许多不同的方式接触到每个人。例如，现代医学实际上只能追溯到第二次世界大战。对你们来说，这是很久以前的事了，但这是我有生之年的事。

I was born before World War II, and before  World War II, you simply did not get antibiotics when you had an infection.

我出生在第二次世界大战之前，当你感染的时候，你根本没有得到抗生素。

It  was that soon. Doctoring was almost quackery, so much of scientific medicine has happened in  the last 50 or 60 years. Then we have the system of our mind. There's  not just social, but psychological, cognitive, and so forth. We can sum up this world  that we're born into in this century as the systems we live in and the  systems we are. Think about that, the difference between that and what most people think  that they want. These are the systems we have to learn about and deal with.  These systems are not separate.

就这么快了。医生几乎是庸医，在过去的五六十年里，许多科学医学都发生了。那么我们就有了我们的思维系统。不仅仅是社交，还有心理，认知，等等。我们可以把我们出生在本世纪的这个世界概括为我们生活的系统和我们所处的系统。想想看，这和大多数人认为他们想要的不同。这些是我们必须学习和处理的系统。这些系统并不是分开的。

I've mentioned them separately, but they're all intertwined with each  other. They're all invisible. Okay.

我已经分别提到了它们，但它们都是相互交织在一起的。它们都是隐形的。好的。

I'll just leave you with this last slide. We found  out about all of these systems, they were invisible until a few hundreds years ago,  and some of them invisible until a few years ago. The human tragedy is in  two parts. Part of it is just finding out, something in our civilization doesn't automatically  transmit it to people born into the civilization. The educational system has to be changed  in order to reflect this stuff. The composite picture here is that part of our  brain, the genetic part of our brain, even overlaid with this stuff, still has these  reactions and ways of thinking about things or not thinking about things that go back  100,000 years.

我把最后一张幻灯片留给你。我们发现了所有这些系统，它们直到几百年前都是看不见的，有些直到几年前是看不见的。人类的悲剧分为两部分。它的一部分就是发现，我们文明中的某些东西并不会自动传递给出生在文明中的人。必须改变教育制度，以反映这种情况。这里的综合图片是我们大脑的一部分，我们大脑的遗传部分，甚至覆盖着这些物质，仍然有这些反应和思考事物的方式，或者不去思考1000年前的事情。

I think with things like television to look at, things like video games  to look at, things like Facebook to look at, if you're going to go out  and make a company that is going to appeal to people, try to do it  without appealing to the parts of their nature that they're helpless in front of, because  one of the things that those of us who helped invent the technologies of today  are quite worried about now is that the technology is so much easier to invent  than it is to change the educational system. What we've got is, the informational equivalent  of cave people with nuclear weapons. Now they're informational weapons, and in many ways I  think these weapons are more dangerous because by re-normalizing human attitudes and human beliefs could  very easily bring down our civilization and put us back into the Stone Age. The  talk on Tuesday may be a little thicker today, but the whole impetus behind the  ARPA research and inventions of these things, and particularly people like Englebart, was to try  to invent new tools and new media for humanity to get itself out of its  problems. Englebart, for example, said, "Almost everything important that has consequence in the adult world  is done by adults working together." This is why his system was collaborative. Here's an  interesting thing. Here's a Mac. Some people have Linux, some people have Windows on it.  Here's the interesting thing. Not a single one of the main operating systems today has  built into it the thing that Englebart showed in 1968, which is the intrinsic thing  to ability to share any content that you're looking at with anybody else, to the  point of allowing them to interact with it and to talk back and forth. Skype,  it doesn't do it. This is a thing that is at an operating system level.  It's not a trivial thing to do.

我想像看电视，看电子游戏，看Facebook这样的东西，如果你要出去创建一家吸引人们的公司，试着去做，而不去吸引他们在面前无助的部分，因为我们这些人中的一件事帮助发明今天的技术的人现在非常担心的是，这种技术比改变教育系统要容易得多。我们得到的是，拥有核武器的洞穴人的信息等价物。现在它们是信息武器，在很多方面，我认为这些武器更危险，因为通过重新规范人类的态度和信仰，可以很容易地摧毁我们的文明，让我们回到石器时代。周二的讨论可能会稍微复杂一些，但是ARPA研究和发明的全部动力，尤其是像恩格尔巴特这样的人，试图为人类发明新的工具和新的媒体来摆脱它的问题。例如，恩格尔巴特说：“在成人世界里，几乎所有重要的事情都是由成年人共同完成的。”这就是为什么他的系统是协作的。这是一件有趣的事。这是一台Mac。有些人有Linux，有些人有Windows。有趣的是。现在还没有一个主要的操作系统将恩格尔巴特在1968年展示的东西融入其中，这是一个内在的东西，它可以让你和其他人分享你所看到的任何内容，让他们能够与它进行交互和交流。Skype，它做不到。这是一件在操作系统级别上的事情。这不是一件小事。

It is possible to do but not a  single operating system used today does it, and so the ability to actually work collaboratively  on content has been held back by notions of operating systems that go back pre-1965.  All three operating systems we have today that are the main ones are old, old  ideas. They don't even get to where PARC was on the notion of how processes  can coordinate with each other. There are many, many other of these things. Because these  operating systems are rather similar to each other and because they're pervasive, unless you use  your reality kit, you're going to think that they're normal and therefore that's the way  things should be. Many people in computing have a misplaced notion of Darwinian process, like  most people. Most people think Darwinian processes optimize. That is absolutely not the truth. One  of my degrees is in molecular biology, and I can tell you any biologist would  say, they absolutely not optimize. The whole point of Darwinian processes is to fit into  some niche and some environment.

现在使用的操作系统是有可能做到的，但没有一种操作系统能够做到这一点，因此，实际上在内容上协同工作的能力受到了早在1965年以前的操作系统概念的限制。我们今天拥有的三种操作系统-主要的操作系统-都是老旧的想法。他们甚至没有到达Parc在流程如何相互协调的概念上的位置。还有很多，很多其他的事情。因为这些操作系统是非常相似的，因为它们是普遍存在的，除非你使用你的现实工具包，你会认为它们是正常的，所以事情应该是这样的。与大多数人一样，计算机领域的许多人对达尔文过程有着错误的看法。大多数人认为达尔文的过程是最优的。这绝对不是事实。我的一个学位是分子生物学，我可以告诉你，任何生物学家都会说，他们绝对不会优化。达尔文过程的全部意义在于适应某些生态位和某些环境。

If that environment isn't the right kind of environment, the  process of evolution is not going to give you something that's very interesting. That is  the way it works. As computing gets less and less interesting, its way of accepting  and rejecting things gets more and more mundane. This is why some of these early  systems, like Sam looked at Sketchpad and said, "Why aren't they doing it today?" Well,  because nobody even thinks about that that's important. Nobody even thinks of doing WYSIWYG on  web media.

如果这种环境不是正确的环境，进化的过程就不会给你带来一些非常有趣的东西。这就是它的工作方式。随着计算变得越来越不有趣，它接受和拒绝事物的方式变得越来越平淡无奇。这就是为什么一些早期的系统，比如Sam看着Sketchpad说：“为什么他们今天不这么做呢？”因为没人想到这很重要。甚至没有人想到在网络媒体上做“所见即所得”。

I just typed in some answers to CORA, and I was in a  regime that was pre-'70s.

我刚输入了科拉的一些答案，当时我在一个70年代以前的政权里。

I was typing into a little window, I couldn't see what  it was going to look like until I clicked the button. Come on, this is  bullshit, but nobody is protesting except old fogies like me, because I know it can  be better. You need to find out that it can be better. That is your  job. Your job is not to agree with me. Your job is to wake up,  find ways of criticizing the stuff that seems normal. That is the only way out  of the soup. You have to go against your genetic impulses to try and learn  the environment around you.

我在一个小窗口里打字，直到我按下按钮，我才知道它会是什么样子。拜托，这是胡扯，但除了像我这样的老笨蛋，没有人抗议，因为我知道这会更好。你得找出更好的办法。那是你的工作。你的工作就是不同意我的意见。你的工作就是醒过来，想办法批评那些看起来很正常的事情。这是汤的唯一出路。你必须违背你的遗传冲动去尝试去了解你周围的环境。

It's the most natural thing we have, but it's not going  to help, because the environment is weak, and if you learn the environment, you're going  to be weak.

这是我们拥有的最自然的东西，但它不会有帮助，因为环境是脆弱的，如果你学习环境，你就会变得软弱。

Speaker 3: All right. Thank you very much.


演讲者3：好的。非常感谢
