# How to Build a Product IV - Jan Koum

Sam: Today's speaker, we have Jan Koum. Jan is the founder of WhatsApp. Whatsapp, as we  mentioned in an earlier iteration of this, is the startup that did everything right. After  not trying to get jobs at Facebook, and not, for either Jan or Brian, they  put their heads down, they figured a product that people really wanted, and while everybody  else in Silicon Valley was going to conferences, doing PR, whatever else it is people  do other than making a product that people really love, WhatsApp just quietly built this  thing that was used by ... How many people by the time of the acquisition?
Jan Koum: 450.

Sam: 450 million people for a consumer app, and more than a billion now, and was  acquired by Facebook a couple of years ago, and Jan can tell that story, but  thank you very much for coming to talk with us.

Jan Koum: Sure. Thanks for having me. So, when someone asked to come and speak here, I  think I made some smart-ass comment how I'm going to speak about people actually building  a product and not going to class, or something like that. But as Sam mentioned,  we were just fortunate in a way that we stumbled into something that people really  wanted, and I'll explain in a second how we got there, but the credit really  goes to not necessarily us having some brilliant idea.

I think the credit goes to  also being in the right time, at the right place, and building a product that  people wanted, and just realizing that people wanted it. So just to kind of give  the history of how we got where we got, we actually ... Both me, and  my girlfriend, and Brian, we were at Yahoo for about ...

I was there for  9 years, he was there for 11 years, and that time was actually really, really  valuable for us to learn how to scale back on servers, what makes a good  product, what makes a bad product, and seeing the Yahoo as a company get really  successful, and them to start. We left in 2007, just coincidentally we both left around  the same time, like within a month difference, and we took some time off. We  took about a year off, so we left at 2007, we took all of 2008  off. He moved to New York with his girlfriend, I was just goofing off, and  I really kind of fell in love with my Nokia phone.

I had this candy  bar, I think it was 6610 Nokia phone that I jail-broke.

I installed a net-mon  software, which showed you which mobile cell you were connected to, and all these advanced  things you could do with the phone that you couldn't do when you took it  out of the box. So at the end of 2008, I went traveling.

I went  to Argentina, I went to Russia, to Ukraine, to Hungary, to Israel, to a bunch  of countries.

I was gone for like 2-3 months on and off, and what I  found really hard during that time was keeping in touch with my friends, especially in  Argentina.

I don't know if anybody here is from Argentina, or been to Argentina, like  ... There you go, so one person. What was your dialing code? Like it's so  complicated! I could never understand it. When we were in Argentina, just having people call  us, or me calling people was like ...

I went and got a local sim  card, but I couldn't figure out how people would call me, because of these weird,  complicated dialing codes and prefixes, and I was just like, ugh! So this is how  2008 ends, and January of 2009, my birthday was coming up in February, and I  figured I'll get myself an early birthday present, I'll go buy and iPhone.

I went  to the Apple store, bought an iPhone, and right around the same time as the  came out.

I think there was no SDK when iPhone first came out in 2007,  but I think they released at September of 2008. So I was literally 3-4 months  after iPhone came out ... Sorry, after iOS SDK came out, I got an iPhone  and I started tinkering with it.

I was also really board, and I had a  lot of free time, so I'm like, "Okay, well let's install this weird thing called  Xcode," luckily I had a Mac. Let's install Xcode, let's figure out what can be  done, let's build some simple app, and then you kind of realize, "Holy shit! It  has full internet connectivity, and it can do full TCP/IP stack, so it basically is  a little computer that can talk to your server." So I'm like, "Okay, cool. What  can we do with it?" The first thing that we built, which I don't know  how many of you know this is the history of WhatsApp, the first thing that  we build was actually this concept of a status. So the idea was, if you  ever used, and you all might be too young for this, if you ever used  something like AOL, AIM or ICQ, or IRC, or any of these products, you have  this concept of status, like Yahoo Messenger had this "away from keyboard", or "I'm busy",  or "I'm in at a meeting". So the first thing that you would do when  you used those messengers is you would like ... The first message you would send  was, "Hey, are you there?" That was like the first message you sent to start  a conversation with somebody on ICQ, or if you private messaged somebody on IRC, because  people would be away, and so they would use a status to indicate I'm not  near a computer, or I'm AFK, or whatever. So the idea was, "Well, let's take  this concept of status and just apply it to your phone, so before people call  you, they can check your status." Maybe you're busy, maybe you're in a meeting, maybe  you're traveling, whatever. So if you don't pick up, at least people know why you  don't pick up, and that was kind of like the WhatsApp 1.0 application, and what  we built was the app that hooked into your address book, so the other thing  that kind of worked in our favor was there were address book APIs on the  mobile phone. They didn't really exist on a desktop, right? If you think about desktop,  like Windows from 2000 to 2008-ish, people never really put address books on their desktops.  People always had address books on their mobile phones, and so even if API existed,  there was nothing to query, because the address book database was empty on all these  devices. Luckily, the one thing that Apple opened was their address book APIs, which was  great for us. What we did was ... Sorry, we basically went through the address  book, and we could figure out if the contact in your address book was another  WhatsApp user, and that's basically how the status worked. We would take your phone number,  and if it was an international phone number, we would try to normalize it to  the plus format so all the phone numbers in our system would start was a  plus in the full international format. We would be able to detect if the other  person is a person on the WhatsApp network, a user of our product, and the  idea was that before you start a phone call, or before you send a message,  you would check the status of this person from WhatsApp, and they would say, "Oh,  I'm available," and you would call them. That was the WhatsApp 1.0.

It failed horribly,  like, it was a disaster.

It was depressing. Nobody used it. People downloaded it, surprisingly  enough, and I think people downloaded it because there were like no apps back at  that time. There were maybe a thousand or two thousand apps in the whole App  Store, because it just went live. So we benefited from being early, but the idea  wasn't that great. People would download, and they would never use it. People just called  people like they normally would.

It was really hard to replace a native dialer, that's  kind of what we wanted to do. We wanted to replace the native dialing application.  We struggled for a little bit. We kept adding all these weird features, in retrospect.  Back then we though they were the best thing ever, like you could set your  status to automatically change at a certain time of day.

If you knew you were  always in a meeting from 2:00 to 4:00, you could automatically configure it to always  say that you were in a meeting from 2:00 to 4:00.

It kind of had  that functionality, and then something happened around the summer of 2009, Apple introduced Push notifications.  Back then, if you wanted the application to wake up, the only way to wake  it up was the user tapping on an application icon, and there was no way  to do anything in the background, which in retrospect was really backwards, because ...

I  don't know if any of you know about Nokia Symbian phones, but s60 and BlackBerry  had all this capability, even before iPhone came out, to do auto-start, to do background  multitasking, to do networking, to do all of this stuff. So iOS actually limited what  we can do, so we were struggling, and then Apple introduced Push notifications. We were  like, "Hallelujah!" We ended up hooking it up into Push notifications, I think this was  around the summer time, even before they were still in beta, because we had developer  access. We noticed that people were using the status as a way to kind of  communicate with each other. They would change the status to say, "I'm going to a  bar," and the change in status would broadcast, and go to all the other people  who used WhatsApp in their address book. So around the summer of 2009, we were  like, "Huh.

Interesting, maybe we should build messaging." And then it all kind of clicked,  because I always used SMS, and if you remember in the old Nokia phones, the  SMS was not threaded. So you would get a message, it would show up as  a phone number, and if you get any other messages from that person, it would  show up as just another entry in your list. Then iOS came out and introduced  threaded SMS and everybody went, "Wow." So we kind of said, "Okay, well we can  do full networking, we can do TCP/IP, we can connect a phone if your phone  is a client to a server on the backend. We already had all this code  to figure out if you're a WhatsApp user or not, we could take your phone  number, parse it, figure out all the international prefixes. We even figured out Argentina at  some point, which was not an easy thing to do, but we got there. So  we got to a state where we could actually have people send messages over WhatsApp,  and if you look at our application today, you see all these features. You see  group chat, you see ability to send media, to record voice messages, to do all  this stuff. We didn't have any of it. The only thing we had was one-on-one  messaging, that's it. Just think how antiquated that is, and that's what the launch was.  Around September, I think it was September-ish ... Maybe late August, early September ... Maybe  even early October, I actually don't remember, is when we launched messaging, and it took  off.

It was intuitive to us why it took off, because SMS was so expensive  back in those days, right? And especially international SMS. So if you had two people  who were living in two different countries, how did they communicate? Well, they could send  each other SMS, it was expensive. They could us Skype, but Skype mostly worked on  a desktop, so you had to synchronize the time when both of you are in  front of a computer, and people usually are not. Some of you have computers open,  but if you get a Skype call now, you're not going to answer it, right?  There was really no good way for people to communicate in real time. So that's  why SMS was so popular, because your phone was always with you.

It was always  in your pocket, it was always no matter where you went you had your phone  with you. When you sent an SMS, you never said, "Hey, are you there?" You  never did that, you just sent an SMS. The only thing sometimes you could say  is, "Hey, did you get my message?" Because SMS was so unreliable, especially internationally. That  was the other problem that we could solve by building on top of TCP/IP, is  we could add reliability in our protocol. So we rolled out messaging, we made it  super reliable, we added all these visual indicators. You knew if the message actually was  successfully delivered to a server, you knew if it was successfully delivered to the device  that you were sending it to, and it just took off. When Sam talked about,  "Well, we kind of went heads down, and we didn't go to conferences, and we  didn't do a whole lot of other stuff." It's just because we were lucky. We  stumbled into something that people really, really had a need for. Just think about SMS  back in 2006-2007, right? There was no iMessage, nothing else worked on your phone. SMS  was expensive, it was horribly limiting. You could only send 160 characters at a time,  and if you sent a longer message, it would break it into multiple chunks, and  sometimes the chunk of the bottom would arrive first. So you have to read the  message at the bottom and then read the message on top after that. Media was  horribly expensive, and it was not working well across platforms.

If I sent a video  recorded on Nokia phone to a BlackBerry user, I probably couldn't have watched it. Or  if you sent a video recorded on BlackBerry to an iPhone it probably wouldn't work  either. So we had all these limitations with SMS that we were trying to address  in our product, and obviously the biggest problem was cost. SMS was very expensive in  Europe and in many countries outside of North America, and we just kept going. Once  we figured out that there is a need for it, we were like, "Well, we  better hire." So we hired some of our old friends from Yahoo, who left Yahoo,  some of our ex-Yahoo friends. We hired a friend of mine who I actually meant  when I was working at Stamford, when I was doing IT at Graduate School of  Business in like '96, '97-ish, back when I was in high school. So he came,  and he helped work on the BlackBerry client, and so our goal was like, "Okay,  well we've got to build all these features, but we've also got to build all  these platforms," because we started out with iPhone, but the world back then was very  different. Nokia actually was majority smart phone platform back in the days. Not in North  America, but if you looked at the rest of the world, everybody was using Nokia  smart phones, and BlackBerry, and Android I think didn't even exist, or just barely existed  at the end of 2009 and early 2010. So, we had to build for Nokia,  and we had to find people who could actually build for Nokia, Symbian and s60,  and we had to find those people in Europe because nobody in Silicon Valley even  heard of Nokia. We found two really good engineers to help us build that. Funny  story about our Nokia client, it's actually built using Python. Not a lot of people  know that actually Nokia s60 had a Python runtime. So remember when Brian, my co-founder,  he started looking at Nokia because we knew that we had to do Nokia, so  he went away for a week. He comes back a week later, he's like, "You're  not going to believe this, you can use Python to build a client." I was  like, "No way! Get out of here." He was like, "No, no, no, no, no!  Seriously! You don't understand. You can run Python on this little, tiny phone." I was  like, "Okay, let's try and do it," and that's what we did. The Basic was  a whole backend. The communications, the protocol was all in Python, and the UI was  actually in C++. We started working on building multiple platforms, and we started working on  building features. So we launched BlackBerry, we launched Nokia s60, we launched Android, all within  a few months of each other in 2010, and then we started building features. We  had to build what people asked us to build. People wanted group chat. Everybody's like,  "This is great.

I love your product.

I want to have a group conversation with  my family, or three friends, or five coworkers, or ten people in a study group."  And we're like, "Okay, well ... How do we build group chat? Let's figure it  out." We sat down and sketched the user experience, then figured out how to make  the backend system work for group chat, and then people wanted ... Obviously we very  quickly added multimedia, and I think multimedia is what really took us to the next  level. Once we added the ability to send a picture, which today is like comical.  How could not have ability to send a picture through a messaging product over your  smart phone? Back then you couldn't. There was nothing that worked really well, or was  cheap or was reliable. So we added the ability to send a picture, we added  the ability to send videos, we at some point introduced voice messages, and then things  just took off. At that point, it was just scaling the backend, and this is  where it kind of ties into what I was talking about earlier, where me and  Brian worked at Yahoo. Because we spent so much time there, and because we were  there in early days, and we saw the company scale, we had all this experience  to scale the backend, and we had our own share of outages and our service  wasn't 100% perfect, but we would make sure that we would learn from an outage,  and make sure that we would add the right monitoring in place, and we would  have enough capacity always for holidays like Christmas and New Years where the traffic spiked.  But having that experience working at Yahoo, learning how to scale the backend systems, learning  how to tweak the operating systems and kernels, and networking stack, the ethernet driver if  you had to.

It all kind of tied together, so our experience at Yahoo, our  experience with difficult or challenging SMS protocol that we used as consumer, kind of all  combined with this perfect timing that happened in 2009, 2010 with smart phones coming online,  and people wanted to have this ability to communicate.

If you think about a smart  phone, it's ultimately ... Like the messaging is a killer app for a smart phone.  So we just basically stumbled into the killer app, because there is nothing else you  do more with a smart phone than communicate. Most of it is probably talking to  your friends and family, and your loved ones, either over iMessage or WhatsApp, or Skype,  or anything else. Yes, the guy from Argentina.

Speaker 1: Could you do it again?
Sam: Huh?
Speaker 1: Could you make another app again that takes off?
Sam: A messaging app, or just an app?
Speaker 1: Just any app.

Jan Koum: I couldn't.

I'm sure you can.

I already did it once, the chances of being  successful again are like zero. The odds are in your side, so you should go  and do something. That's why we're able to actually spend all of our time heads  down, building our product, because we had this amazing product market fit. We had this  amazing product that people wanted. They were like, "Gimme, gimme, gimme!" When we were rolling  out Nokia s40, which was just step below a Nokia s60, which was kind of  like a picture phone, people were emailing us, asking for like, "When is it going  to be done? When is it going to be done? When is it going to  be done?!" So there was a huge pent up demand for any platform before we  would launch it, and that's why we didn't have a need to go to the  conferences and do a lot of PR, or do anything like that, because we had  people who needed our product, and we had millions of people who were waiting for  us to build a new feature or a new platform, and that's why we were  able to just go heads down and build the product. That was kind of the  background that I wanted to give you on how we got started. We can do  a Q&A for the next 15-20 minutes, and ... Yeah.

Speaker 2: The specific thing I wanted to hear most about is how you dealt with the  launch of iMessage, and Facebook Messenger, and all of these other messaging platforms. WhatsApp was  clearly first, and then the world got scary quickly. How did you think about that?  What was it like inside of the company?
Jan Koum: So, how did we think about iMessenger and all these other platforms? Well, with iMessage  we ... When did they launch? I think 2011-ish? Something like that.

I think 2011,  at the developer conference. So the world in Silicon Valley is very different from the  world outside.

In Silicon Valley, if you look around, 90% of people of an iPhone.  Not only do they have an iPhone, they have the latest, greatest iPhone. Outside of  Silicon Valley, it's like 80-90% Android. So for us, having an iMessage launch was just  like a small blip on our radar.

Speaker 2: What about Facebook Messenger?
Jan Koum: So I think Facebook for a very long time didn't have a good messaging .  I remember they bought this company called Beluga, which ...

I think it was Beluga.  That was group messaging, so they were kind of focused on group messaging at first,  and then they shut it down and turned it into Facebook Messenger, but Facebook Messenger  was part of the Facebook app.

It wasn't really a dedicated app back in the  day, but ultimately if you look at the Facebook Messenger, the graph that the Facebook  Messenger is using is very different from the graph on your phone.

If you think  about people you add to your address book, and people who you add on Facebook,  there's going to be some overlap, but for the most part it's going to be  different. People who I add on Facebook are probably not people who I'm going to  message with a lot, and people who I put in my address book are people  who are probably a different graph in terms of how important they are to me,  and if I add you into my ... Basically if I exchange a number with  somebody, it means I give them the ability to WhatsApp me, SMS me, or call  me. There are probably a lot of people who I'm friends with on Facebook who,  if they called me, I would probably first go like, "Who is this? Oh yeah!  We met each other once and I added them." I'm probably not necessarily a typical  example.

I'm sure there are people who have different graphs on different networks.

I'm sure  there are people who use WhatsApp only for work, and they only have their coworkers  on the WhatsApp, or in their address book, and I'm sure that there are people  who only have a certain set of their contacts in one or the other. But  I think overall, this idea of like, "Well, if I add you to my phone,  I give you permission to interrupt my life," is what makes our network a little  different, because people have these connections that are stronger with people who they have on  each other's address book. With Facebook, I have people I went to high school with,  I have people who I went to nursery with, and it's great that I can  keep in touch with them on Facebook, but I wouldn't want them to call me  randomly, out of the blue at 7:00pm.

It would be just awkward, because I haven't  talked to them for years. So the graphs are different in that sense. So we  always had ... Kind of going back and generalizing it, we always had competition. From  like day one. There was actually a point in time where there was a new  messaging app popping up like every month, and every month there was an article in  TechCrunch how this awesome new messaging app is going to take down all other messaging  apps, and I don't know if they paid TechCrunch to write it or what, and  then we just read this, and we'll go like, "They have no users! How can  you write that story in TechCrunch?!" It just makes no sense, and obviously we didn't  want to say anything, because we don't want to draw attention to ourselves. We actually  on purpose tried to stay under the radar, but it was just kind of funny  to see this from the sidelines, all this kind of dog and pony show that  happened with all these apps.

I mean, there was PingMe, there was MessageMe, there was  GroupMe, there was Kik. They were like, "Hello!" There were like ten different messaging apps  at some point, which kept getting all this publicity, and we were like, "Good for  you. Have the publicity you want, we'll just stand under the radar, and not have  any attention drawn to us." So we always had competition, be it big guys like  iMessage or Facebook Messenger, be it little guys like Kik. We always had competition, we  always ... Even today we still have apps like Telegram out there, and LINE or  Kakao, but what we said, that our destiny is really in our hands. We can't  worry too much about competition, we have to worry about our product, and our users,  and if we spend a lot of time thinking about competition or looking at competition,  we're going to fail. Yeah.

Speaker 3: So trying to build on what you just talked about this, so with your graph  ...

I mean, I feel like this whole social graph, it is actually now changing?  At least among me and my friends.

I think I don't call people so much,  I don't really send them SMS.

I will probably add people mostly on this social  media, like online, Facebook, or I could on chat apps like WhatsApp, but I feel  like this whole social graph, it is changing slowly, because people call less and people  send SMS less. People like to do it more on these social media platforms. Do  you have a view on that? And do you think there's any opportunity beyond that?  Or do you think this has been true?
Jan Koum: Yeah, I think it's true. So the question was, the world is changing. People call  less, and now people add. The social networks all kind of merge into one now.  Yeah, you're right.

I think people call less these days, and people mostly message each  other.

I don't really know if we would do anything differently today, or even back  then.

I think for us, the focus has always been on, "Well, we want to  provide a utility, we want to provide an application that is purely only about communication."  So if you look at some other apps like WeChat, or LINE, or Kakao, they  do a lot of different things, right? You can order taxis through WeChat, and you  can follow people online. Like LINE has a whole feed concept, and we always wanted  to build something that is really, really efficient and utilitarian, and also fast and reliable.  I mean, not a lot of people can have the latest and greatest smart phone.  A lot of people have Android phones that are low end. A lot of people  have or used to have BlackBerry phones that didn't have a lot of horsepower, and  a lot of memory, and a lot of CPU. For us it was always about  reliability and efficiency of the app, and not trying to do all these different things  that a lot of different social networks and apps do.

Sam: Yeah.

Speaker 4: So how do think about Messenger right now? Because now Messenger integrated a lot of  features that WhatsApp had.

I am starting to use Messenger a lot more, and that  I think takes away from the air time of WhatsApp. Do you have a ton  of competition?
Jan Koum: No, I think in general there is still a lot of room for both apps  to grow.

I think Messenger is really strong in countries like North America, like the  United States for example. So I think we compliment each other geographically.

I think if  you look at countries like India, or Israel, or Hong Kong, or Germany, or Spain,  WhatsApp has a really strong foothold in those countries, and I think if you look  at something like Australia or North America, you're probably going to see Messenger do really  well. So a lot of it is also not necessarily split by a graph, but  also by a country you're in. Yeah?
Speaker 5: I appreciate the humility that you couldn't do it again with another app, but I'm  sure people ask you all the time for help or advice. How do you determine  if you hear an idea or look at an application that can do really well?  How do you think you know?
Jan Koum: It's very simple. The question is how od you determine if an app has a  potential or is a good idea.

It has to solve a really basic problem, and  it has to do it in a simple and efficient way.

I mean, going back  to what we built, we in some ways solved a problem, right? People had a  problem communicating when they were not in the same room, when they were in different  cities, or different countries, or in different time zones. So it's not that it wasn't  impossible, it's just it was hard and it was expensive, and we made it easier  and cheaper, and when you offer something to people that is easier and cheeper, people  of course will use it. So I think the number one thing to look at  for me, when I look at a product, does it solve a need? And does  it solve a need on a global scale.

If you solve a need for people  on Stamford campus, that's great, but can it scale to a billion or two billion  people.

If you solve a need for people only in Silicon Valley by providing them  chargers for their Teslas, great. How many people have Teslas in the world? It's got  to be a global ... Actually a lot of people have a Tesla, I don't  know, but it's got to be a global solution that applies to everybody in every  country potentially, right? That was kind of-
Speaker 5: That's something I see so many start-ups sort of get wrong as you said, in  Silicon Valley. Everyone's got the iPhone 7S or whatever we're on now. How did you  build that into the culture of the company? To think about your users all around  the world?
Jan Koum: I don't know. We got lucky with the people we hired. That was the other  thing that I didn't mention that I should've mentioned. We ended up with a really  incredible team that we mostly hired out of our personal network from ex-Yahoo, and from  friends of friends.

I think ourselves had a really good understanding.

I mean, me myself  being an immigrant, and growing up in another country, and going to all these other  countries, I understood that there was more to a smart phones than just iPhone. That  was the thing that everybody talked about and wrote about in 2008 and 2009. So  for me, especially as somebody who really liked Nokia phones before Nokia went out of  business, I was like, "We got to build for Nokia, because they're great phones, and  there's like a billion Nokia smart phones out there." So I think just me and  my girlfriend are having that perspective, probably distilled through the company, and people understood that,  "Hey, you know you don't want to just build for iPhones. You don't want to  just build for the latest and greatest. You have all these millions of phones out  there, billions of phones out there that you've got to build for because you want  those users to be using your product, and they also were asking us to do  that." Yeah.

Speaker 5: Can you talk about the business, as far as incorporation, equity and raising money?
Jan Koum: The business side, my favorite topic. Sure. So we incorporated on my birthday, on February  24th of 2009, and the reason I ... The thinking that was going ... So  let me back up. We were trying to submit an app into the Apple Store,  and I didn't want to do it under my own name. Like, I didn't want  the app to say Jan Koum, because I figured who would want to install an  app made some guy? So I figured would be official! We should have a company!  I'm like, "Okay, so go to Google. How do you start a company, right?" It's  just like, step 1! So I got friend of mine, he was an insurance broker.  He had his own company and he was like three blocks away from me in  Santa Clara, where I lived.

I went to his office, because I used to buy  insurance for my car and my house from him, and so I was like, "Dude,  how did you incorporate?" He was like, "Oh, it's easy. You take these articles of  incorporation." It's like one page with five things written in it, and you go to  San Francisco to the State Building, the Secretary of State or whatever, and he gives  them $100 and they stamp it and you're done! I'm like, "No way! It can't  be that easy." He's like, "Yeah, it's that easy." I'm like, "All right." So, we  had to submit an app, and they wanted us to show ... Apple Store wanted  us to actually send them a copy of the incorporation articles.

It was like, "Okay,  easy." I have nothing to do that day, I'm going to drive to San Francisco,  get lunch, got to this office, get a stamp, get a letter, great. Send it  to Apple, they look at the letter, they're like, "Yep, you're legit. You're a company,  you can no submit under the name WhatsApp." I'm like, "Cool." Submitted an app under  the name WhatsApp. So that was how we incorporated.

In terms of ...

It's easier  than it sounds, back then it was like a struggle for me, because I'd never  done it. How did we think about money, or the whole funding thing? So we  left Yahoo with some savings, because Yahoo did really well in the late '90s, early  2000s, and so we had stock, we had options, we had our issues. So I  was actually able to not only take year off, obviously not do anything extravagant, but  live off my savings for a year, and then I had enough money to where  ... While I was still tinkering around with an app, and we didn't have exuberant  costs ...

I actually remember when we started out, I was using my buddy's server,  this guy Chuck who also used to work at Yahoo. He used to run Yahoo  Sports, and so I used to sit next to the Yahoo Sports team, so we  became friends.

I was like, "Hey Chuck, can I use your server? I don't want  to pay $20 a month for a server." He was like, "Yeah, sure." So saving  $20 month on the server was a big deal for me, and so we would  run originally on his server, and I remember at some point as we launched messaging,  and saw all this growth, he was like, "Dude, you got to get your own  servers." And I'm like, "No, no, I'm fine.

I don't want to pay for my  own servers." He's like, "No, no, no. You got to get your own servers. You're  taking up all this CPU and bandwidth." I'm like, "No, no, no.

I'm fine, I'm  fine." So eventually, he kicked me off his server, which was great, because we switched  from Linux to FreeBSD, which a lot of them we had experience with at Yahoo.  So we were able to actually, for a long time live off our savings, and  since we had all this experience on how to run the company efficiently when it  comes to servers, and backend, and bandwidth, and everything. There was not a lot of  expense. The expense started when we had to go hire people, and the idea was  that, "Okay, well we're going to have to pay for more servers. We're going to  have to pay for bandwidth. We're going to have to pay for a , because  the sign up on WhatsApp, you have to verify your phone number." And we did  a small angel round ...

I can't really remember.

I think it was end of  2009, we did a small angel round, and then we basically kept our company without  losing too much money, because in early days, iPhone app was actually paid. People had  to pay $1 to download an iPhone app while everything else was free, like Android,  and BlackBerry and Nokia. So we had people paying for iPhone app, and that gave  us the ability to pay for the bill, for electricity, for bandwidth bills, for server  bills and all that stuff.

I think probably around 2011, 2010-2011, people started knocking on  our door. Like, we didn't even out to look for money, which is a great  situation to be in, because if you're going to go and raise, and you need  money, you're probably not going to get the terms you want. Which for us, kind  of worked in our favor, because all of these started coming to us, and they're  like, "You guys are doing great, we want to partner with you. We want to  give you money." And we're like, "Eh, we don't really need it," which makes them  want to invest even more. So we kind of did this dance where we're like,  "No, no. We don't really want your money. Come back in a few months." Eventually,  after all of these conversations, me and Brian sat down and we're like, "Okay, well  we're just wasting their time and our time. Should we just take funding, or should  we not?" And we decided that we should, because it's better to have money in  your bank account for your business than not, and that's the words of wisdom that  I got from Jeff , who you know, because Jeff was like: If you can  have money in your bank account, you should have money in your bank account, because  you never know if you need to buy a building, or if you need to  buy some office space, because you started growing too quickly, and you don't want to  negotiate and raise money when it's too late. You want to do it when you  don't need money. So listening to words of wisdom of Jeff , we were like,  "Okay, let's get some funding, and we partnered with Sequoia, and we got money from  Sequoia. Any other questions? Yeah.

Speaker 5: Can you sort of walk us through your internal psychology and confidence over the trajectory  of the company? Like at the beginning, did you identify that the market timing was  pretty spot on? Or were you just sort of following what your users were saying  to you?
Jan Koum: I think until we did messaging, when we were doing that link your status feature,  obviously it was rough, because we had no users, and nobody uses our products. So  you're sitting there, in your room, building a product and thinking like, "Well, nobody wants  it. Why am I doing this? What is the meaning of life?" And all of  that stuff, right? It's tough, right? When you're building a product that people don't really  want, you feel rejected. You feel like, "Why aren't you using it? It's great! I  put all my energy in it!" So, once we added messaging, it was 180 degrees  difference. All of sudden everybody wants our product, everybody thinks it's the coolest thing ever.  We get all these letters into our own inboxes, all these emails from people saying  how great your product is. "I'm able to keep in touch with my fiance.

I  got married because of your product." "Your product helped me save lives because the hikers  were lost, and the hikers were able to use WhatsApp share location to send ..."  It's just night and day, right? When people want your product, and they love your  product, the psychology inside a company is just different. People would come into work, and  they would be like, "We're building the best thing ever. People love the product, this  is great." So we didn't really have to do a lot of selling, even to  the candidates. People who came in to interview with us basically fell into two camps.  People who live in the Silicon Valley bubble, and never heard of WhatsApp, and they  would be like, "Why would I want to work for WhatsApp?" And people who fell  into like, ["Wow 00:38:29], there is a whole world out there," bubble, and they were  like, "You guys have millions of users. Like my cousin in Spain, or my friend  in Germany was telling me about your product, and everybody uses it!" Or people would  say, "I went to India, or I went to the Middle East and everybody uses  your product! It's amazing! How come nobody heard about you?" And we're like, "Well, that's  the purpose." So basically, we had these two types of people we would interview, and  obviously the people who had a Silicon Valley bubble didn't even want to come work  for us, which is not the end of the world, because there were plenty of  people who understood there was a whole big world out there, and they were happy  to build a product for hundreds of millions of users all over the world. Yeah.

Sam: .

Speaker 8: How was the fundraising experience, and you partner with Sequoia?
Jan Koum: Why did we partner with Sequoia? We had a few companies give us term sheets.  One of them even gave us a blank term sheet. They're like, "Fill out the  number you want." And we were like, "Well, if they're that irresponsible with other people's  money, maybe we shouldn't be partnering with them." Sequoia's just an amazing break, right? For  me, living in Silicon Valley since 1992, and reading articles and seeing news about all  these companies that went public like Netscape, and Cisco, and Google, and knowing that a  lot of them were backed by Sequoia just made it not a very difficult decision  to pick Sequoia. We also really people who worked there. A lot of it is  just personal chemistry. A lot of it is the seed company understanding how much to  be hands on or not. Like, Sequoia was actually really great about ... They knew  the numbers and knew we were growing. They didn't meddle, right? They didn't need to  come in and say, "You guys are doing this wrong, or doing that wrong." There  was no need for that, and I think we had that understanding upfront, where they  kind of made us a promise. They were like, "We're here to help you financially.  We're not here to help you with management, we're not here to help you write  code, we're not here to help you build features. We're here just to help you  grow and to help your financial, and if you need any help outside of that,  come knock on our door and we'll try to help." And they were really helpful  with stuff when we asked, like recruiting or anything like that. They would sometimes meet  with prospective candidates and tell them why they should join WhatsApp. So Sequoia was really  great.

It was a brand, and I remember actually, when we had multiple terms sheets,  me and Brain went to Jeff 's house, and we were talking to him.

It  was late in the evening, we were trying to just get advice on what we  should do, and he kind of like looked at all them, and we talked through  all the different term sheets, and then he said, "You know, once you're a Sequoia  company, you're a Sequoia company." It's like that branding is really strong, and it means  a lot.

Speaker 9: I have an important one.

Jan Koum: Yes, welcome. For you.

Speaker 9: How did you get your first few thousand users back in the day with set  the status?
Jan Koum: Oh, oh. How did we get our few thousand users? So there was no apps  back then, and iOS ... Well, it wasn't iOS back then, it was iPhone OS,  and the Apple Store had this category, What's New, and the trick was to submit  a new app like every few days so you would always show up on top  of What's New. You would make a small change to the name, because I think  back in the old days, the name difference triggered you as new app. So we  would basically have Status, and then it would say like, "Status for your smart phone,"  or "Status for your calls," or "Status for your iPhone," or, "Updated status." We would  basically tweak the name a little bit with every new version we'd submit, which always  kept us almost always at the top of the New category, and since there were  no apps, people would go to What's New category all the time to try to  download whatever people would build, because today you have thousands of apps, you have like  hundreds. Basically, by gaming the systema little bit, we're able to ...

I think the  loophole got closed really quickly, but luckily by that time we already had messaging. Yeah.

Speaker 10: How did you scout out your company? I mean, how do you scout out WhatsApp  into different countries?
Jan Koum: How did we scout into different countries?
Speaker 10: Yeah.

Jan Koum: We didn't have to scout. Well, we did have to a couple of things, I  take it back. There were two things that we had to do. One, we had  to build different platforms, because there were some countries where iPhones just didn't exist, and  everybody was using either Nokia, or BlackBerry, or a combination of two. The second thing  that we started doing early on is focusing on localization, right? So again, this kind  of goes back to Silicon Valley bubble where everybody in Silicon only speaks English, therefore  the rest of the world must speak English. Not quite. So we focused early on  on localization. We actually hired people internally into the company who were doing two things.  There were customer support representatives, so they would help people with problems, and write FAQs  and help debug issues. They were also all multilingual, so we would hire somebody who  was perfect in Spanish, and we would hire someone who is perfect in German, and  would hire someone who is perfect in Portuguese, and we would hire somebody who is  perfect in Italian. We would hire somebody who is perfect in all these languages where  our apps were starting to grow so we could build a really good, localized experience.  When you download WhatsApp in Brazil, it's not in English, it's in Portuguese.

I think  that is what helped us grow in all these countries. Yeah.

Speaker 11: How did you convince your first few employees, I know they came from your personal  network, but how did you convince them to join you?
Jan Koum: It wasn't hard. Most of them were unemployed. So let me see ... So Brian  joined ... Brian left Yahoo, and I think didn't really do anything for like ...  I think he left in '98. So he didn't really do anything for like ten  years. He was one of the early app engineers, so that was one. Chris, my  friend who I knew from Stamford, I think he was doing a start-up that wasn't  really going anywhere, and he was in LA, and he got married to this wonderful  girl whose parents are actually from here. So I think for her, it was an  advantage to move here to be closer to her parents. So I'm like, "Yeah, yeah!  You guys should move. You guys should move, here! Move back to Northern California!" So  it's a combination of her wanting to move to be closer to her parents, and  him not really doing anything and not having a full-time job also contributed. This guy  Eugene, who was one of our early hires, he was working at a company ...  I actually knew him through my social network, we aren't still friends. Like he would  always complain how he hated his job, and how they were trying to screw him  over by promising him stock options and never delivering. He hated it. So I'm like,  "Well, here's a good opportunity." We had, let's see ... Who else? We hired this  guy Michael who was in New York, wasn't really doing anything also. He was referral  through a friend of mine from Yahoo. So there was this guy Michael who I  used to work with at Yahoo, who was working at a start-up and we would  keep in touch, and at some point I was complaining to him how hard it  is to find good engineers that are smart and capable, and can get shit done,  and don't just sit there and theorize. He was like, "Oh, I know a guy,"  calls this guy Michael in New York. So, we randomly call this guy Michael in  New York, and I'm like, "Hey, Michael.

I got your name from other Michael. Do  you want to come and interview?" And I figured he would say, "No, I'm pretty  happy in New York," but he wasn't really doing much. He was like, "yeah, okay."  So he came in and interviewed. We had ... Let's see, we had one of  the guys, one of our engineers was in Russia.

It was this guy, Igor. He  wasn't really doing much in Russia, also.

It's not like they have Silicon Valley in  Russia. We were like this band of outcasts in some way. The group of people  who weren't really doing much, and got together and built a product, but there were  also people who were working full-time who actually had to try really hard to convince  to join. One of the guys, Rick, who helped us a lot, was a backend  as we were scaling the backend, he was working a Yahoo. So I think it  took us six months of meetings and dinners with me and Brian trying to convince  him, and we would meet him ... And we would do it in a very  subtle way. Not like, "Come join us!" We were like, "Oh, you know, we have  all these users, and we have all this ..." and we knew that he was  really, really technical, and he loves solving problems. We weren't saying like, "Come join us,  and we'll give you lots of money or options, or whatever." We were playing a  different angle. We were saying like, "Hi Rick, if you're watching this." We were like,  "Hey Rick, we're having all these technical problems," and we did, "and we just don't  know. There's this weird issue with FreeBSD 8, where it computes for kernel resources with  Erlang, and Erlang is trying to run on these 48 cores, and we don't know  how they're ... There's some contention in the kernel, if only we could figure it  out. We just need some help." And we knew that he loved doing that kind  of stuff, right? So with him we played a different angle, it took us a  few months to convince him, but eventually he joined, and he helped us fix a  lot of bottlenecks in our system. So, they're all different stories, but I think the  bulk of the initial core of people who joined, they were from our professional and  personal networks.

Sam: We are out of time, unfortunately.

Speaker 11: Oh, man! I think you're going
Sam: All right, we'll do one more question.

Speaker 11: Thank you.

Speaker 12: I think WhatsApp is center role model of being focus.

I want to understand your  decision making process when you get feedback from users. How you define it's an asset  to your product? How you define it's a key feature you need to improve, and  how you find out that the efficiency of communicating is a core feature you want  to focus on for so many years?
Jan Koum: How do we know what features to build on, and what features not to build?  And you're absolutely right, because in the early days, people would write in and say,  "We want usernames," or, "We want PINs," because people were so conditioned by all these  messaging apps that came before us, that you need to have a username or PIN.  So like, if you were using DBM, or if you were using ICQ, you had  some random PIN that you would have to exchange with people, or if you were  using Skype or Yahoo Messenger, you had to have a username. People didn't understand that  what we were building was this whole new idea of, you don't need any of  that stuff. You just sign up with your number, and it's connected to your phone  that has the same phone number, and you go. So in early days, a lot  of feedback we took from useful. They were like, "We want groups, we want multimedia,  we want to have additional privacy controls, we want to turn off our last seen."  Great, we built a lot of what people asked, but we also didn't build what  people asked because we didn't think it was the right fit for our product. Like  having the fundamental belief, and the gut feeling that what you're doing is right, and  having that vision of it's just going to work.

I'm going to build it using  phone numbers, I'm not going to have usernames, I'm not going to have PINs, because  it makes the product more complicated.

It makes the product to use, people forget their  usernames and PINs and all that stuff. Having that belief in yourself, and knowing that  what you're building is going to work is obviously also important. So that's kind of  how we would make decisions.

Sam: Okay, you go ahead, and then we'll after the 1:00pm class.

Jan Koum: Yeah.

Speaker 13: How do you feel about the security issue of future security issues of messenger app?
Jan Koum: What do I feel about security issues or future security issues? Well, for us, as  you know, we rolled out end-to-end encryption, and we weren't the first ones to do  it. Obviously there were apps before us that focused on security, but we were the  first ones to do it on such a global scale for everybody seamlessly, right? I  mean, there is no other app today that has more than a billion people that  has end-to-end encryption enabled by default into everything you do.

Individual chats, group chats, and  everything else. So, we didn't start out ... Again, this kind of goes back to  what we started with.

It was just a pure one-on-one messaging, right? There was no  group chat, there was no multimedia, there was no end-to-end encryption, there was no video  callings, there was no voice callings. There was none of that, but over years we  made a commitment to our users that we were going to add all those features,  and we were going to make them work, and make them work really well. So  obviously, we feel strongly that encryption is important, and we feel strongly about end-to-end encryption,  which is why we added it, and which is why we have it in our  application today.

Sam: Great. Thank you so much.
