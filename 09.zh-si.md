# How to Invent the Future I - Alan Kay

#如何创造未来

Sam: We have Allen K with us this week, he's going to do both lectures. Allen  K has forgotten more about how to invent the future than the rest of us  put together ...

山姆：这周我们有艾伦·K和我们在一起，他两次都要讲课。艾伦·K已经忘记了更多关于如何创造未来的东西，而不是我们其他人加在一起的.

Allen K: That would make very bad class, Sam. But yeah ...

艾伦K：那会是很糟糕的课程，山姆。但是的.。

Sam: I think Allen is the genuine world expert on this inventive with others, the 0  X alto, which we recently restored, with a group of incredible computer scientists, and I  think it is the person who has been the most thoughtful, probably of anyone I've  ever met about how you build organizations to do real innovations. So thank you very  much for coming, I am super excited to hear this.

萨姆：我认为艾伦是真正的世界专家，他和其他人一起发明了“0 X ALTO”，这是我们最近修复的，有一群令人难以置信的计算机科学家，我认为是这个人是我所见过的人中最有思想的，也许是我见过的任何人中的一个，你是如何建立组织来进行真正的创新的。所以非常感谢你的到来，我很高兴听到这个消息。

Allen K: Great Sam. Well I'm thoughtful about it because I got to watch masters do it,  I'm basically a research scientist but I was interested in the process done by far  better managers than me, who could deal with larger sets of ideas and I'll try  to give you a gist here. Basically, I think because people are here because they're,  they want to do start-ups and make money, I just want to point out that  if you want to make money, don't bother with a startup, create an industry. Because  then you get trillions instead of billions. So it's about a factor of a 1000  between doing invention over innovation.

艾伦K：伟大的山姆。嗯，我考虑过了，因为我要看大师们做这个，我基本上是一个研究科学家，但我对比我好得多的管理者所做的过程很感兴趣，他们能够处理更多的想法，我将在这里给你们一个要点。基本上，我认为因为人们在这里是因为他们，他们想创业并赚钱，我只想指出，如果你想赚钱，不要为创业费心，创建一个行业。因为你得到的是数万亿而不是数十亿。所以，在做发明而不是创新之间，大约是1000倍。

In other words, not going incrementally from the present. But  carving out a whole new set of ideas, it creates an entirely new context. We'll  see some of the ways to go about it and we'll also see some of  the barriers, let's see if this, this has a bad user interface because it has  the back button here to front button ... Let's see if that works. So, a  lot of what these two days are about are talking about the place that most  people naturally live, which is the present. But the problem with the present is that  it is so flittery and distracting, there is so much stuff going on, that it's  hard to think about anything but the present and if you're thinking about the present  your ideas are going to be derived from the present and therefore they're going to  be incremental and therefore you wind up doing innovation.

换句话说，不要从现在开始递增。但是创造出一套全新的想法，它创造了一个全新的环境。我们会看到一些方法去做它，我们也会看到一些障碍，让我们看看这是否有一个坏的用户界面，因为它有后退按钮在这里前面的按钮.让我们看看这是否行得通。所以，这两天的很多事情都是关于大多数人自然居住的地方，也就是现在。但现在的问题是，它是如此的浮躁和分散注意力，有如此多的事情在进行，以至于除了现在你很难想到任何东西，如果你在思考现在，你的想法将从现在而来，因此它们将是渐进的，因此你最终会进行创新。

It's not that you can't make  money that way. But, today I'm going to do my ... The opposite of my  usual order.

这并不是说你不能那样赚钱。但是今天我要做我的.。和我平时的命令相反。

I usually like to build a lot of context first but I thought  in the spirit of the Harvard Business School, and the equivalent at Stanford I'd start  off with things like results and process and methods first so you have a feeling  that I'm actually saying something that you might quote on quote "Apply". But the important  talk is really Thursday, I'm still struggling with making it the right size, so today  we're going to do that and I urge you to copy my email address.

我通常喜欢先建立大量的上下文，但我认为，本着哈佛商学院的精神，以及斯坦福大学的同等学历，我会首先从结果、过程和方法等方面着手，这样你就会感觉到，我实际上是在说一些你可能会引用的话-“应用”(Apply)。但重要的是星期四，我仍然在努力使它的大小合适，所以今天我们要这样做，我敦促你复制我的电子邮件地址。

I  love emails. We're not going to have the discussion we should have, here, I welcome  any questions. And by the way, while I'm talking I welcome questions at any time.  Don't be shy. Okay? And, here's why school pisses me off. Great man in our  field, Marvin Minsky observed that this is the best place ever to keep you from  ever thinking about anything for long enough. So you don't want to try and learn  in a classroom, it's terrible.

我喜欢电子邮件。我们不会进行我们应该进行的讨论，在这里，我欢迎任何问题。顺便说一句，在我说话的时候，我随时欢迎提问。别害羞。好吧这就是为什么学校让我生气的原因。马文·明斯基说，在我们这个领域里，这是最好的地方，可以让你永远不去想任何事情。所以你不想在教室里学习，这太糟糕了。

In face, I don't like to do classroom process. Partially  because of the time constraints, but also because it's oral. We might as well be  sitting around a campfire 100 000 years ago. And almost everything that's happened that's important  in the last, several thousands of years, has been basically literary informed. Okay? So, one  of my favorite Picasso sayings, and he meant a lot of different things by this,  "Part of it is the best you can ever do with any kind of representations  is make, kind of a map. Even when you're trying to make a map of  a map. You're making a lie compared to the thing you're trying to represent, but  if you do it right, people can gain some intuition about what the map is  about". That's what science is all about, this talk in 50 minutes has to be  a lie.

面对现实，我不喜欢做课堂过程。部分是因为时间的限制，也是因为它是口头的。我们还不如在10万年前围坐在篝火旁。几乎所有发生在过去几千年里重要的事情，基本上都是文学知识。好吧所以，我最喜欢毕加索的一句话之一，他的意思是很多不同的东西，“它的一部分是你能做的最好的任何一种表现是做，一种地图。即使你想用地图做地图。与你想要表达的东西相比，你是在撒谎，但如果你做得对，人们就会对地图的意义有一些直觉。“这就是科学的意义，50分钟后的演讲一定是个谎言。

It really is, I'm leaving out a lot of important things. And, but  I think the shadow of the talk or whatever is projected by the talk is  pretty close to the way things actually are for doing this very different process. And  a think that Picasso didn't say but he knew and he meant is art is  also the lie that tells the trust that wakes you up. So if something wakes  you up in the next two days, I will have done my job. And then,  the two days are really about another Picasso quote which is "Learn the rules like  a pro so you can break them like an artist." And not doing this is  probably the greatest sin of Silicon Valley since the 80s. Almost never, nobody has bothered  becoming a pro. Particularly in software and user interface design. And so when they break  the rules, they're breaking them like a dumb child does, by throwing rocks through windows.  And it's probably the most sickening thing to see about the field. So, another way  of thinking about the mantra is you have to learn everything and then find a  way of forgetting it so you can have your own ideas but, what you forget  is everything except the perfume, so when you have an idea then your nose will  pickup the right scent and you'll be able to make use of all the stuff  that you've learned after you've had the idea.

真的，我遗漏了很多重要的事情。而且，我认为谈话的阴影或任何由谈话所投射的东西，都非常接近于事情的发展方式，这是一个完全不同的过程。毕加索没有说，但他知道，他的意思是艺术也是一个谎言，告诉你唤醒你的信任。所以如果在接下来的两天里有什么事情吵醒你，我就会做好我的工作。然后，这两天真的是关于毕加索的另一句名言：“像专业人士一样学习规则，这样你就可以像艺术家一样打破规则。”不这样做可能是80年代以来硅谷最大的罪过。几乎从来没有人愿意成为专业人士。特别是在软件和用户界面设计方面。所以当他们违反规则的时候，他们就像一个愚蠢的孩子一样，把石头扔进窗户。这可能是这个领域里最令人恶心的事情了。所以，另一种思考咒语的方法是，你必须学会一切，然后想办法忘记它，这样你就可以有自己的想法了。但是，你忘记的是除了香水之外的所有东西，所以当你有了一个想法，你的鼻子就会闻到合适的气味，你就能利用你在有了这个想法之后学到的所有东西。

I was specifically asked to talk about  Xerox PARC because that was an example of making trillions instead of billions, and so  I thought, "What I'll do here is just show you a couple of results from  Xerox PARC" and I'll then try to give you some of what it took to  get those results. So Xerox PARC is known for this machine that happened, I gave  one to Sam. He got it working with the help of some really great people,  so this machine happened in 1973, which is 11 years before the Mac and it's  screen was more than twice the size of the Mac and ...

我被特别要求谈论施乐Parc，因为这是一个生产数万亿美元而不是数十亿美元的例子，所以我想，“我在这里要做的是向大家展示施乐Parc的几个结果”，然后我将尝试给你们一些获得这些结果所需的东西。所以施乐帕尔以这台机器而闻名，我给了山姆一台。他让它在一些真正伟大的人的帮助下工作，所以这台机器发生在1973年，也就是Mac的11年前，它的屏幕是Mac的两倍多。

It was more  like a Mac of 1988 or 1989. So it was about, maybe 15 or 16  years ahead of the commercial development and the commercial development actually was based on the  stuff that was done on this machine. So this is an example of the best  way to predict the future, is to invent it. There was nothing like this before,  once we did it people could see, "Oh yeah, there could be something like this,  because here it is".

更像是1988年或1989年的Mac。这大概比商业发展提前了15到16年，而商业发展实际上是基于在这台机器上所做的事情。所以这是预测未来最好的方法之一，就是发明它。以前没有这样的事情，一旦我们这样做了，人们就会看到，“哦，是的，可能会有这样的事情，因为它就在这里”。

In fact we made 2000 of these. So there was a  lot to look at. They had bitmap screens, they had pointing device, the famous Gui,  which you're still using today. Wizzy Wig means what you see is what you get,  desktop publishing and the whole media gig ... What does that say ... That's not  helping me ... Can anybody read that? Oh yeah, symmetrical reading and writing, meaning what  you almost never get on the web but that you did get in many of  the apps of the 1980s which is when you get a document the thing that  you read the document with also allows you to edit the document. So if you  think about the web, it's actually much more made for consumption than it is for  authoring. They are completely decoupled. Most of the authoring facilities are typing in tiny little  windows and then pushing a button to see what you did. So this is a  vast retrogression. What we call real-loop these days, we just called it object oriented programming  back then.

事实上，我们创造了2000这些。所以有很多东西要看。他们有位图屏幕，他们有指向设备，著名的GUI，你现在还在使用它。奇幻假发意味着你看到的是你得到的，桌面出版和整个媒体演出.上面写的是.。这帮不了我.。有人能读懂吗？哦，是的，对称的阅读和写作，意思是你几乎从来没有在网络上获得过，但是你确实在上世纪80年代的许多应用中获得了，也就是当你得到一个文档时，你阅读文档的东西也允许你编辑文档。因此，如果你考虑到网络，它实际上是为消费而制造的，而不是用于创作的。它们是完全解耦的。大多数创作工具都是在小窗口中输入，然后按下按钮看看你做了什么。这是一个巨大的倒退。现在我们称之为“实循环”，那时候我们就叫它面向对象的编程。

I made up that term. But, what's called object oriented programming today is  not what we had back then, and I don't think that I'll have time to  really talk about the profound differences. Suffice to say that what we did at PARC  became popular and everybody wanted it even if they only got the label. Comparison is,  you can go out and buy a set of designer jeans with the label Harvard  on them and for all I know it was Stanford on them. A laser printer,  main difference between this and what you have today is, it was, the first one  was a page a second. So most people have never printed with a page a  second printer. Post script, outline fonts and so forth. The ethernet, peer to peer and  client server, and 50% of the internet PARC did an internet before there was the  internet. And we're part of that community so we participated in the official internet. So  we think of that as eight and a half inventions, how long did it take?  Well 25 researchers for five years. Think about that. Two dozen people did all of  these things in about five years. Cost about 10 to 12 million bucks a year  in today's money, return is about 35 trillion, this is an old number.

那个词是我编的。但是，今天所谓的面向对象编程已经不是我们当时所拥有的了，我不认为我会有时间来真正地谈论那些深刻的差异。我只想说，我们在Parc所做的一切变得很受欢迎，每个人都想要它，即使他们只得到了标签。比较而言，你可以出去买一套名牌牛仔裤，上面贴着哈佛的标签，据我所知，这条牛仔裤是斯坦福的。一台激光打印机，它和你今天的主要区别是，第一台是每秒一页。因此，大多数人从未用第二台打印机打印过一页。后文、大纲字体等等。以太网、对等服务器和客户端服务器以及50%的InternetParc在互联网出现之前就已经使用了互联网。我们是那个社区的一部分，所以我们参与了官方的互联网。所以我们认为这是八个半的发明，花了多长时间？有25名研究人员工作了5年。想想看。二十几个人在大约五年的时间里做了所有这些事情。在今天的资金中，每年花费大约10到1200万美元，回报约为35万亿美元，这是一个旧的数字。

Its probably  more like 40, now. So that's pretty good return on investment, think about it.

现在可能更像40岁了。所以，这是相当不错的投资回报，想想看。

If  you like to do little spread-sheets and stuff. 15% is good, right Sam? Yeah. So,  it was an industry rather than an increment. People say, "Well, but Xerox didn't benefit  from this, they didn't make any money from this". Complete bullshit.

如果你喜欢做小的床单之类的。15%是好的，对吧萨姆？嗯因此，这是一个行业，而不是一个增值。人们说，“但是施乐并没有从中受益，他们没有从中赚到任何钱”。彻头彻尾的胡说八道。

It's made up by  companies who don't want to invest in research. Xerox made about a factor of 250  over their entire investment in PARC. So that's 25000% return right there. Xerox's bug was  that it didn't understand the rest of the stuff, but they certainly understood was a  laser printer was and they made billions from it. And in fact, if you look  at it, it was better for the world that they stone-walled us. Because, no single  company can handle an entire industry. So this made it possible. The Japanese had to  do printers slightly different than that. And this kind of heaven on earth lasted for  about 12 years, Xerox finally fired the guy who made it all happen. You'd think  he would have been rewarded, right? Because he made all this stuff happen. But in  fact, they hated him, and they hated him for the reason that most companies hate  people who are doing something different, because it makes middle management and upper management extremely  uncomfortable. The last thing they want to do is make trillions. What they want to  do is make a few millions in a comfortable way. And so, this leads to  an enormous problem that where the, the real job of upper management in the 20  and 21st century is to learn things. Because change is the constant thing that's going  on. What they try to do is to maximize whatever they had when they got  into the job and whatever the company was successful at. Think about it.

它是由那些不想投资于研究的公司组成的。施乐在Parc的全部投资中，赚了大约250倍。所以25000%的回报就在那里。施乐的错误是，它不理解其他的东西，但他们当然知道是激光打印机，他们从中赚了数十亿美元。事实上，如果你看的话，他们用石墙把我们围起来对世界更好。因为没有一家公司能处理整个行业。所以这使它成为可能。日本人不得不做的打印机略有不同。这样的天堂在地球上持续了大约12年，施乐最终解雇了这一切的始作俑者。你会觉得他会得到奖赏，对吧？因为这一切都是他造成的。但事实上，他们恨他，因为大多数公司讨厌做不同事情的人，因为这让中层管理人员和高层管理人员非常不舒服。他们最不想做的就是制造数万亿美元。他们想做的是以一种舒适的方式赚几百万美元。因此，这导致了一个巨大的问题，在20世纪和21世纪，高层管理人员的真正工作是学习东西。因为变化是经常发生的事情。他们试图做的是最大限度地利用他们进入工作岗位时所拥有的一切，以及公司的成功之处。好好想想。

If large  companies were actually rationale, there'd never be a small company. There'd be no startups because  large companies have vastly more resources for doing new things than any venture capitalist. Right  Sam? They've got gazillions of money. But because they refuse to get into new businesses,  and refuse to change the old businesses, you guys have a chance. So just pray  that they don't ever wake up. Now the interesting thing is that if you look  at that collection of inventions, you see every single one of them today. And what's  interesting is if I were to enlarge this a bit, I would show that there's  hardly been anything interesting invented since this funding stopped. So it's been a nuclear winter  of people cashing in on these inventions and extracting the wealth from them. But hardly  any efforts of any interesting kind to go beyond them. And last point here is  the lack of curiosity. Sam is a huge ...

如果大公司确实是合理的话，就不会有一家小公司了。没有创业公司，因为大公司比任何风险投资家都有更多的资源去做新的事情。对吧萨姆？他们有数以百万计的钱。但是因为他们拒绝进入新的业务，拒绝改变旧的业务，你们有机会。所以祈祷他们永远不会醒来。有趣的是，如果你看看这些发明的集合，你就会看到今天的每一个发明。有趣的是，如果我把它放大一点，我就会发现，自从资金停止以来，几乎没有什么有趣的东西被发明出来。因此，这是一个核冬天，人们利用这些发明赚钱并从中获取财富。但几乎没有任何有趣的努力去超越它们。最后一点是缺乏好奇心。萨姆是个巨大的.。

I bet Sam because he wanted  to know where'd all this stuff come from.

我打赌萨姆是因为他想知道这些东西是从哪里来的。

I've hardly ever been asked that question.  It's the most successful generation of wealth in computing history and almost nobody wants to  know. Sam did. And the difficult thing about today and Thursday is the world that  you grew up in, because I don't see anybody ...

我几乎从来没有被问过这个问题。这是计算史上最成功的财富创造，几乎没有人想知道。是山姆干的。今天和周四最难的是你长大的世界，因为我没看到任何人.

Is anybody here older than  35? Okay.

这里有35岁以上的人吗？好的。

I see a little more reflectivity back there. Yeah, so almost everybody in  the room grew up in a world that's unlike the world I'm going to just  tell you about now. So it's just ... Many many things were qualitatively different in  ways that are sometimes difficult to explain. So here's the book to read, this is  why lectures suck. This is a 500 page book done very carefully about the whole  story of RPA and Xerox PARC. Anybody who's really interested, read this book. This is  a tribute I wrote to this whole research community about, I don't know, 14-15 years  ago. And I'm ...

我在后面看到了一点反射率。是的，所以房间里的几乎每个人都是在一个不像我现在告诉你的世界里长大的。所以这只是.。许多事情在本质上是不同的，有时很难解释。这是我们要读的书，这就是为什么讲课很烂的原因。这是一本500页的书，非常仔细地讲述了RPA和Xerox Parc的整个故事。任何真正感兴趣的人，读这本书。这是我在14-15年前给整个研究团体写的一篇文章，我不知道。而我.。

I'll hand it out at the end of the class. The  main thing that's interesting about it perhaps is the bibliography which has a lot of  references on more detailed things you can read about how this particular community operated. Right?  And the important thing about Xerox PARC which is not emphasized enough is that PARC  was jut another one of the RPA research projects. So, there's eight years of research  before PARC happened and PARC only happened because of the Vietnam war. Nobody wanted to  do this stuff inside of a company, the company quarterly cycles and everything are really  antithetical to long range thinking, so this stuff was all funded by Cold War funds  in the public domain. So none of the IP was kept secret. But it was  done in a better rhythm so to get the 35 trillion, it actually required not  five years, but 12 to 14 years. We were the lucky researchers who got our  PhDs in this process, and we're the right age to go to PARC and finish  it off. Right? And as we'll see, I'm not going to dwell on it much  more, but the zeitgeist of doing this way of doing things go back to the  ... Specially the radar effort and MIT. And the air defense effort and then RPA  and then PARC. So there's a long continuity here of kind of, how do you  work on things that are ... That are doable but where you have to invent  several generations of technology to get to the thing that's doable. Most of these things  are not doable with the technology that's lying around, that is the problem with these  hard problems. Okay, so the general world, the normal world, the present, for most of  this period was either punch-card accounting machines or their replacement, after IBM said famously "There's  no room for more than five or six computers in the entire world", they wound  up doing the first mass produced computer, the 1401, the first computer I ever programmed.  To replace their punch-card machines before other computer companies did, so they did a sort  of Trump like reversal on their belief. And wound up owning the 60s and much  of the 70s. And most important thing ... This is a dumb sentence because you  don't know what these machines were like. So I realized after I put it in  there that, "Why did I even put this sentence in?" Right? But it, the way  I look at what's going on at any given time, whether it's today, 30 or  40 years ago is, whatever is going on right now is just crap. By definition.  If we know about it, except in the one tenth of one percent, or one  thousandth of one percent, it's gotten mundane. And part of it is just because of  the bell curve of normality in humans. Whatever it is, it gets converted to something  like normal, no matter how exciting it is. And so, when things are widely successful,  they tend to bring up the ... The mean of the bell curve a little  bit for everybody, raises all boats, but in fact there's also this regression to the  mean on almost all of these things, so living in the present ... Man, you're  out of, you're just out of it.

我会在课结束时发出去。最有趣的是它的参考书目，它对更详细的内容有很多参考，你可以读到这个特定的社区是如何运作的。对吗？施乐Parc的重要之处在于，Parc是RPA的另一个研究项目，这一点没有得到足够的重视。所以，在Parc发生之前已经有八年的研究了，Parc只是因为越南战争才发生的。没有人想在公司内部做这件事，公司的季度周期和所有的一切都与长远的想法相反，所以这些东西都是由冷战基金在公共领域提供的。所以所有的IP都没有被保密。但它是以更好的节奏完成的，为了得到35万亿美元，它实际上需要的不是5年，而是12到14年。我们是幸运的研究人员，在这个过程中获得了博士学位，而我们现在正是去Parc并完成它的合适年龄。对吗？正如我们将要看到的，我不会再多说下去了，但是用这种方式做事的时代精神可以追溯到…。特别是雷达和麻省理工学院。然后是防空力量，然后是爱国军，然后是派克。所以这里有很长的连续性，你是如何处理那些.这是可行的，但在那里，你必须发明几代技术，才能得到可行的东西。这些东西中的大多数都不能用周围的技术来完成，这就是这些难题的问题所在。好吧，一般的世界，正常的世界，现在，在这个时期的大部分时间里，要么是打卡记帐机，要么是它们的替代品，因为ibm曾说过“全世界没有超过五六台电脑的空间”，他们最终完成了第一台大规模生产的计算机，1401，我编写的第一台计算机。为了取代他们的打卡机比其他电脑公司，所以他们做了一种特朗普，就像逆转他们的信念。最后拥有了60年代和70年代的大部分时间。最重要的是.。这是一个愚蠢的句子，因为你不知道这些机器是什么样的。所以当我把它放进去后，我意识到，“我为什么要把这个句子放进去？”对吗？但是，我对任何特定时间发生的事情的看法，无论是今天，30年前还是40年前，现在发生的一切都是垃圾。根据定义。如果我们知道，除了十分之一，或者千分之一，它就变得平淡无奇了。部分原因是人类正常的钟形曲线。不管它是什么，它被转换成正常的东西，不管它是多么令人兴奋。所以，当事情成功的时候，他们倾向于.钟形曲线的平均值对每个人来说都有点高，所有的船都会上升，但事实上，几乎所有这些事情的平均值也都在回归，所以生活在现在。伙计，你不干了，你就不干了。

If you're trying to think about things from  what we have now. Now the ... There are two processes ... There's the bomb  project, and the radar project at MIT that had roughly the same process, roughly the  same difficult ... You have to realize the US is in World War Two for  only about two and a half years. Right? Pearl Harbor was December of 1941, and  so we had 42, 43, 44, 43 and a half years and a lot of  things got done. The most interesting thing is for the first time in history really,  a lot of really scientists and a lot of really good engineers started working together.  And cloning each other. So seven Nobel prizes came out of the building 20 thing  ... Because they were physicists who put on their engineering hats to make 185 different  kinds of radar systems and install them in every size of building and plane and  ... Boat, and World War Two was basically a war of supply. And it was  the ability to stave off the German submarines that actually won the war for us.  Most people don't think of it that way, but that's what happened. So, it the  zeitgeist I'm talking about, came out of this group and there's a couple of good  books about how these people went about ... Doing things. Maybe then number one thing  is what I ... Have on the right hand side.

如果你想从我们现在的情况来思考问题的话。现在.。有两个过程。有炸弹计划，麻省理工学院的雷达项目，有大致相同的过程，大致相同的困难.你必须意识到，美国在第二次世界大战中只有大约两年半的时间。对吗？珍珠港是1941年12月，所以我们有42，43，44，43年半的时间，很多事情都完成了。最有趣的是，在历史上第一次，很多真正的科学家和很多优秀的工程师开始一起工作。互相克隆。所以七个诺贝尔奖来自20楼.因为他们是物理学家，他们戴上他们的工程帽子，制造185种不同类型的雷达系统，并安装在建筑物和飞机的各个尺寸上。船和第二次世界大战基本上是一场补给战。而真正为我们赢得这场战争的是能够击退德国潜艇的能力。大多数人不这么想，但事实就是这样。所以，这是我所说的时代精神，来自这个团体，有几本关于这些人是如何进行的好书.做事。也许那时候最重要的是我.。在右手边。

Is said, "Forget about your  egos, and I really meant it, doesn't matter who you are, how smart you are,  how smart you think you are, there's only one that counts here, is making progress.  And we make progress through synergy". And they learned how to do this and they  pass it on generation after generation. Well the next round of this after World War  Two was the Cold War, and the air defense system that was done in the  50s, and again at MIT the first displays that you could interact with ... That  is essentially a stylus in the guy's hand, it was called the Light Gun. So  he's pointing at something on the screen and he's squeezing the trigger like he would  put a stylus down and he would push it down and the light gun can  tell ... A computer can tell what the light gun is looking at, and so  you can do all of the stuff that you used to today. To give you  an idea of what these guys did, I can't really see what this is, right?  It's just like ...

他说，“忘掉你的自我，我真的是认真的，不管你是谁，你有多聪明，你认为你有多聪明，这里只有一个在取得进步。我们通过协同取得进展。”他们学会了如何做到这一点，并一代地传下去。第二次世界大战之后的下一轮是冷战，和50年代完成的防空系统，在麻省理工学院，你可以与之互动的第一次展示。这实际上是一个手写笔在他的手中，它被称为光枪。所以他指着屏幕上的什么东西，他扣动扳机，就像他把笔放下，然后把它推下去，轻枪就能看出来.一台电脑可以分辨出轻机枪在看什么，所以你可以做你今天所有的事情。想让你知道这些人做了什么，我不知道这是什么，对吧？就像.。

It's obviously four floors of a building, this is a football  field, and if you notice the second floor there, it says computer A, and computer  B, each one of those computers had 50 000 vacuum tubes. Both running the same  programs at the same time and many other interesting things I don't have time to  talk about, but I'll just say that one of these computers started crashing, it took  three or four days to crash, and the reason is it was running diagnostics on  itself and every time there was an instruction failed, it would patch in a simulated  instruction based on what instructions were still working. So what would happen is the machine  would jut get slower and slower and more software like, more like a Turing machine.  Usually they could fix it before it came all the way down, meanwhile the other  one was still working. But even though I shouldn't be digressing, there's a fun thing  here that, there are 32 of these concrete bunkers made. So two interesting thing, what  happened to this stuff? Anybody know? Does this look like anything you've ever seen before?
Speaker 3: Space programs ?
Allen K: Nope, but that's ...

这显然是一栋大楼的四层楼，这是一个足球场，如果你注意到那里的二楼，上面写着计算机A和计算机B，每台电脑都有5万根真空管。同时运行相同的程序，还有很多我没有时间谈论的有趣的事情，但我只想说，其中一台计算机开始崩溃，它花了三四天时间才崩溃，原因是它在运行诊断，而每次指令出现故障时，它都会根据仍在运行的指令来修补一个模拟指令。所以会发生的是，机器会变得更慢，更像图灵机那样的软件。通常情况下，他们可以修复它之前，它来了所有的下降，同时，另一个还在工作。但是，即使我不应该离题，这里有一件有趣的事情，那就是，这些混凝土掩体中有32个是制造出来的。有两件有趣的事，这东西怎么了？有人知道吗？这看起来像你以前见过的东西吗？太空计划？艾伦·K：不，但那是.

Speaker 3: Airline radars, sorry.

航空雷达，对不起。

Allen K: Yeah! Yeah. This actually was the invention of our air traffic control system. That's what  it was designed to do, except it was designed to control traffic of both American  and Russian bombers. And in fact if many of the displays before they replaced them  with flat screen displays were this ... Basically the same big round things so this  whole system lasts until 1982, when the last one was finally decommissioned and 50 000  vacuum tubes were like incandescent light bulbs, they blow out. They're always blowing out. So  of course, they are redundant ones there. Where do we get the vacuum tubes from?  Think about it. All the way through this .  Huh?  No. No, this is vacuum ... There's not transistors in these machines. No transistors, these  are the ...  Absolutely. How did you know that?
Speaker 5: I've heard of it before.

艾伦K：耶！嗯这实际上是我们空中交通管制系统的发明。这就是它的设计目的，只不过它是为了控制美国和俄罗斯轰炸机的交通而设计的。事实上，如果在他们用平板显示器取代之前的许多显示器是这样的.基本上都是一样大的东西，所以整个系统一直持续到1982年，最后一个系统终于退役了，而5万根真空管就像白炽灯泡一样，它们被吹灭了。他们总是在吹气。当然，它们是多余的。我们从哪里得到真空管？好好想想。一路走过来。哈否不，这是真空.。这些机器里没有晶体管。没有晶体管这些是.。绝对一点儿没错你怎么知道的？演讲者5：我以前听说过。

Allen K: Yeah. That's good then, you remembered. That's good, yeah. For the last twelve or eighteen  years of this defense system, which was never used against the Russians ever, cause they  never tried to bomb us and, was actually obsolete very soon because of ICBMs, it  couldn't track them.

艾伦K：是的。那就太好了，你还记得。很好，是的。在过去的十二到十八年里，这个防御系统从来没有对俄罗斯人使用过，因为他们从来没有试图轰炸我们，而且由于洲际弹道导弹，它很快就过时了，它无法追踪到它们。

It was a whole other system for doing that. Yeah, but we  kept it going and there are reasons why it kept going. We bought ... While  we're still contending in the Russian for the Cold War, we're buying vacuum tubes from  them to ... And by the way people still keep buying vacuum tubes from the  Russians for getting old 50s guitar amp sounds. Those over driven sounds, and this guy  who was one of the inventors of artificial intelligence and the inventor of the programming  language Lisp, John McCarthy looked at one of these in the 50s and said, "Everyone  is going to have one in their home some day". Because he didn't give a  shit about the concrete bunkers and anything else like that, cause what he thought was,  "Yeah, this is like ... We get ... This is like an electric power generating  station". Nobody ever sees them, but they're out there, we have wires going into the  home for it's like where we get our water from, it's where we get our  gas from. So utilities, he thought, "Oh there will be an ... Be an information  utility and it will actually be a human right like the telephone to have one  of these things in your home that is connected to all the world's information". So  that was one of the earliest and most influential ideas. 1962, I'm going to show  you a system done on one of these super computers, this was done on the  test computer at Lincoln Labs for this whole sage system, so it's ... This computer  was close to the size of this entire building, with one guy on it at  three o'clock in the morning, so take a look at this. This is Ivan Sutherland.  So it doesn't even really have a display.

这是一个完全不同的系统。是的，但我们一直坚持下去，这是有原因的。我们买了.。当我们在俄罗斯为冷战而战的时候，我们正在从他们那里购买真空管.顺便说一句，人们还在继续从俄国人那里购买真空管，用来演奏50年代的吉他安培音乐。这些过度驱动的声音，这个人是人工智能的发明者之一，也是编程语言Lisp的发明者之一，John McCarthy在50年代看了其中一个，说：“总有一天，每个人的家里都会有这样的声音。”因为他一点都不关心混凝土掩体之类的东西，因为他的想法是，“是的，这就像.我们.这就像一个发电站”。从来没有人见过他们，但他们在外面，我们有电线进入家里，因为这就像我们从哪里得到我们的水，从那里我们得到我们的天然气。因此，他想，公共事业，“哦，将有一个.一个信息效用，实际上它将是一种人权，就像电话一样，在你的家里拥有一个与世界所有信息相连的东西”。这是最早也是最有影响力的想法之一。1962年，我将展示一个在超级计算机上完成的系统，这个系统是在林肯实验室的测试计算机上为整个SAGE系统做的，所以.这台电脑接近整栋大楼的大小，凌晨三点钟就有一个人在上面，所以看看这个。我是伊万·萨瑟兰。所以它甚至没有真正的显示器。

It's actually simulating a computer display here,  this is just in a cycloscope. So, what Ivan wants to do is to draw  flange and so he says "Okay, it's kind of like this, now, take these guys  and make them all mutually perpendicular, and ... Wow, Sketch Pad just solved that problem!".  So it's a dynamic problem solver in there, first window de-clipped, now he wants to  put a hole in the flange. So these are guidelines and the first thing he  does is said "Okay, I want to make these parallel" and see Sketch Pad keeps  them on the line there and lines them up and now he's using them as  guidelines to draw dash lines. You'll see here he misses ... Oh, okay. Okay, and  now he makes the guidelines invisible, they're still there. The constraint was co-linearity there. And  has a knob to continuously zoom. So this is the first computer graphics ever. And  he wants the rivets to go in and go along with that flange and so  again he, this is why the system was called Sketch Pad because you just casually  draw, it's going to use that as the center for the arc here. And again,  he's going to say, "Take these guys and make them mutually perpendicular" and here Sketch  Pad solves that problem, so you wind up with a symmetric object. And ... He  can ... Change things and he'll get another solution, he could have constrained the side  lengths to be ratios of each other. And the kind of problem solving this system  could do were included non-linear problems, so there was , a rivet, and what's cool  about this is that as a master of this, what we call a class and  object oriented programming, so this is not that rivet but an instance of that master  rivet. You might wonder, "Why is the display bouncing around like that?" Well it's putting  up every dot individually at about half the power of this super computer is being  used to just do that. So here's another instance of the rivet, here's another one,  here's another one. And he says, "Oops, I didn't want to have those crossbars there,  so I'll go back to the master rivet and make the crossbars invisible, they're still  there but invisible", and we see the instances. So this is object oriented programming. Maybe  nicer that you've seen it. Get rid of those guys. And now, that construction that  he made, he's made it into a master and so he can make instances of  it. Okay? Get the idea?
Speaker 6: No, I have a question.

它实际上是在模拟电脑显示器，这只是在一个环视镜中。所以，伊万想做的是画凸缘，然后他说：“好吧，就像这样，现在，带着这些家伙，让它们相互垂直，哇，Sketch Pad刚刚解决了这个问题！。。这是一个动态的问题解决器，第一个窗口去剪裁，现在他想在凸缘上放一个洞。这是指导方针，他做的第一件事是“好的，我想让这些平行的”，看到Sketch Pad将它们保持在线上，并将它们排列起来，现在他用它们作为绘制短线的指南。你会看到他错过了.。哦，好吧。好吧，现在他让指导方针看不见了，它们还在那里。那里的约束是共线性的。有个旋钮可以连续放大。这是有史以来第一次计算机图形学。他想让铆钉和凸缘一起进去，所以，这就是为什么这个系统叫做Sketch Pad，因为你只是随便画，它会用它作为弧线的中心。再一次，他会说，“带着这些家伙，让它们相互垂直”，在这里，Sketch Pad解决了这个问题，所以你得到了一个对称的对象。还有.。他可以.。改变事物，他会得到另一个解决方案，他可以限制边长成为彼此的比率。这个系统可以解决的问题包括非线性的问题，所以有一个铆钉，酷的是，作为一个大师，我们称之为面向类和面向对象的编程，所以这不是铆钉，而是主铆钉的一个实例。你可能会想，“为什么显示器会像那样来回跳动？”好吧，它把每一个点单独放置在这个超级计算机的一半功率上，就用来做这件事。这是铆钉的另一个例子，这是另一个。他说，“哎呀，我不想让那些横梁在那里，所以我会回到主铆钉上，让横梁看不见，它们仍然在那里，但它们是无形的。”我们看到了这些例子。这是面向对象的编程。也许你看到的更好。干掉那些家伙。现在，他做的那个建筑，他把它变成了一个大师，所以他可以用它来做例子。好吧明白了吗？演讲者6：不，我有个问题。

Allen K: Yes.

艾伦K：是的。

Speaker 6: What has gone wrong to have sort of ... Regressed from here?
Allen K: Well, anybody in this class ever seen Sketch Pad before? Okay, so, that's part of  the answer. Yeah. We'll pick that ...

演讲者6：有什么问题.从这里回归？艾伦·K：这个班有谁见过素描片吗？好吧，所以，这是答案的一部分。嗯我们来挑.。

It's sort of the larger question that we  have to ...

这是一个更大的问题，我们必须.

It's worthwhile bringing up the question rotating three of them. So this  is the most shocking thing I had ever seen when I went to graduate school  in 66. This system was only three years ... Old at that time, and I'd  been programming for five years and just, conventional programming and ... Seeing this, it blew  my mind. Because it was exactly different that everything I'd ever thought about computing. As  soon as I saw it, I realized, "Oh yeah, of course you can do that".  But I didn't think about that.

这是值得提出的问题，轮流三个他们。这是我在66年读研究生时所见过的最令人震惊的事情。这个系统只有三年.。在那个时候，我已经做了五年的编程了，只是，常规的编程和.看到这个，我大吃一惊。因为我曾经想过的关于计算的一切都是完全不同的。一看到它，我就意识到，“哦，是的，你当然能做到”。但我没想过。

Ivan did. Okay. So, Sketch Pad, interactive computer graphics,  and the way we recognize today for the first time, objects, masters and instances, the  programming was not done by the a kind of program today, but by problem solving  which I think you can imagine is much nicer. Like it will find a solution.  And, it creates automatic dynamics, so simulations. So, it's not just for drawing bridges. When  you draw the bridge in, it knows how to simulate the bridge and tell you  what distresses and strains are. So I said to Ivan, "Ivan, you did all of  this in one ..." this was his PhD thesis.

是伊万干的。好的。所以，Sketch Pad，交互式计算机图形学，以及我们今天第一次认识到的方式，对象，主人和实例，编程不是通过今天的一种程序完成的，而是通过解决问题-我认为你可以想象的-要好得多。好像会找到解决办法。而且，它创造了自动的动力学，所以模拟。所以，这不仅仅是为了拉桥。当你把桥拉进去时，它知道如何模拟这座桥，告诉你什么是痛苦和紧张。所以我对伊凡说，“伊凡，你是在一个.”这是他的博士论文。

I said, "You did all this  in one year by yourself, how could you possibly do it" and he said, "Well  I didn't know it was hard". He just went after what the problem is. And  if you read his thesis, and you should, cause you can see there are things  that are of absolute goodness still today.

我说，“你一个人在一年内完成了这一切，你怎么可能做到呢？”他说，“我不知道这很难。”他只是在追问问题所在。如果你读了他的论文，你应该读，因为你可以看到今天仍然有一些绝对美好的东西。

Its not just relatively good for being done  more than 50 years, it's absolutely good. And his thesis is every other page is  an apology because it doesn't do more. Because Ivan was working on the problem. He  wasn't working on what you could do, he was working on the problem. Yeah. So  Sketch Pad was a bomb shell in this research community.

做了50多年，这不仅是相对好的，而且绝对是好的。他的论文每隔一页都是道歉，因为它做的不多。因为伊凡在研究这个问题。他不是在研究你能做什么，而是在研究这个问题。嗯所以Sketch Pad是这个研究社区的炸弹壳。

It was about to happen,  cause right away you were looking at the future. You just had to believe that  a room ... A building sized computer was going to wind up on a laptop,  or even something at a desk. So the other ... The main player here back  then was a guy by the name of Lick, Lick Lyder, he got given some  money in 1962, by RPA before the Dee and when everybody asked him what are  you going to do, this is what he would say, "Computers are destined to become  interactive, intellectual amplifiers for everyone in the world universally network world wide". He would not  say anything more. Simply gave that money. And now here's some bullet points, I hate  bullet points. But, this is a perfect class I think to put bullet points in.  And I found 16 that will tell you just what you have to do, and  I've thought of a few since but 16 is more than enough. So the first  thing is just picking an idea that's worth dedicating your life if necessary to. So,  this stuff was human destiny, fixing big human problems, like we can't think very well.  We need to make things to help us to think, we need to make things  to help us cooperate. So these were save the world kind of ideas. And they  were done when the Russians were starting to test Hydrogen bombs and things did not  look so good. Forget about goals. The problem is that goals try to be much  more idiosyncratic to individual humans. So research wants to be a vision, so notice there  aren't any goals in the RPA dream. And that allowed Lick Lyder to fund 15  or 20 super smart people who thought they had ways of approaching the dream and  some of these people didn't ... Agree and some of them hated each other. And  Lick didn't give a shit. He just wanted smart people working on this dream. So  fund people not projects. RPA never decided and we'll see a slight modification of this,  but basically fund people not projects.

事情就要发生了，因为你现在就在看未来。你只要相信一个房间.。一台大楼大小的电脑最终会出现在笔记本电脑上，甚至会出现在桌子上的东西上。所以另一个.。当时这里的主要玩家是一个名叫Lick Lyder的家伙，他在1962年得到了一些钱，在Dee之前由RPA给了他，当每个人问他你要做什么时，他会这样说：“计算机注定要成为世界上每个人的交互式智能放大器。”他什么也不说了。只是给了那笔钱。现在有几个要点，我讨厌要点。但是，我认为这是一个完美的课程。我找到了16个，它可以告诉你必须做什么，我已经想到了一些，但是16已经足够了。所以，第一件事就是选择一个值得你毕生投入的想法，如果有必要的话。所以，这是人类的命运，解决重大的人类问题，就像我们不能很好地思考一样。我们需要制造东西来帮助我们思考，我们需要制造东西来帮助我们合作。所以这些都是拯救世界的想法。当俄罗斯人开始测试氢弹的时候，情况就不太好了。忘了目标吧。问题在于，目标对个体人来说是更加独特的。所以研究想要成为一个愿景，所以请注意，在RPA的梦想中没有任何目标。这使得Lick Lyder可以资助15到20位认为他们有办法实现梦想的超级聪明人，而有些人却没有.他们中的一些人互相憎恨。利克一点也不在乎。他只想让聪明人做这个梦。所以资助人们而不是项目。RPA从来没有做出决定，我们将看到这方面的轻微修改，但基本上是为人们而不是项目提供资金。

If you're going to do that, you better have  the very best people, so if you know MaCarthur grants are for individuals, but this  funding was funding groups. Like you fund a MaCarthur. Just five years, forget it. Nobody  in MaCarthur asks ... You never get a second MaCarthur grant. Here they would get  another grant if they'd done something good in five years, but basically idea of MaCarthur  is throw away. We've identified this person of extreme potential, let's just give them five  years of funding and we won't cry if they don't do anything.

如果你要这么做，你最好有最优秀的人，所以如果你知道麦克阿瑟的资助是针对个人的，但这是资助团体。就像你资助麦克阿瑟一样。就五年，算了吧。麦克阿瑟没有人要求.。你永远得不到第二笔麦克阿瑟赠款。在这里，如果他们在五年内做了一些好事，他们会得到另一笔赠款，但麦克阿瑟的想法基本上被抛弃了。我们已经确定了这个极具潜力的人，让我们给他们五年的资金，如果他们什么也不做，我们就不会哭。

It turns out  most MaCarthur people do do something because the people that attract attention are people who  are not working for money. They're doing it because they must. Dear people like artists  are people who do their art because they must. Community not a project. Have to  fund problem finding. This really drives funders crazy today. What I mean by that, most  of the time when you're working on hard problems, you don't know what the right  problem is. This is why visions are really good. Visions are detached.

事实证明，大多数麦克阿瑟人都会做一些事情，因为吸引注意力的人不是为了钱而工作的人。他们这么做是因为他们必须这么做。亲爱的人，像艺术家，是那些做自己的艺术的人，因为他们必须这样做。社区不是一个项目。必须为发现问题提供资金。这真让今天的资助者抓狂。我的意思是，大多数时候，当你在努力解决难题时，你不知道什么是正确的问题。这就是为什么视觉效果真的很好的原因。幻象被分离了。

If you pick  a problem too early you might be picking it out of the current context. And  therefore you're going to be hampered unless you're incredibly lucky. So RPA put a lot  of money into just people dicking around with stuff. Milestones not deadlines, baseball not golf.  Meaning, when you lose a stroke in golf you cry, when you strike out in  baseball you better not cry. Because you're going to do it a lot. And this  is what Lick Lyder said to them, he said "Look, if you're batting 350 in  baseball you're really doing well" and if you look at what we're funding if we  bat 350, we're going to change the world. That's what happened. Nobody cares about all  the stuff that didn't work. And people said, "Well what about the 65% failure?" And  they said well it's not failure in baseball, it's overhead. Hitting a ball is hard,  and when you're doing something really really hard, the times you don't do it well  is zest overhead for doing it the times you do well. And this is the  probably the biggest distinction that business people do not understand. Cause what they want is  actually tiny little uninteresting projects that are guaranteed for success. But sports is right in  front of us. Sports is a really ... Hard and most sports people are not  succeeding all the time. The thing, what's the thing ... The thing in ... Anybody  know baseball here? What's the thing in baseball that's called an error? Like what?  No, just fielding.

如果你发现一个问题太早，你可能是从当前的上下文中挑选出来的。因此，除非你非常幸运，否则你会受到阻碍。所以RPA花了很多钱给那些闲聊的人。里程碑而不是最后期限棒球不是高尔夫。意思是，当你在高尔夫中输掉一击时，你会哭，当你在棒球比赛中出局时，你最好不要哭。因为你会做很多事情。利克·莱德就是这样对他们说的，他说：“看，如果你在棒球比赛中击出350球，你的表现真的很好”，如果你看看我们的资助，如果我们打350，我们就会改变世界。事情就是这样的。没人在乎那些没用的东西。人们问，“那么65%的失败呢？”他们说，这不是棒球的失败，而是头顶的问题。击球很难，当你在做一些很难的事情时，当你做得不好的时候，你在头顶上做的时候你做得很好。这可能是商界人士不明白的最大区别。因为他们想要的实际上是微小的、无趣的项目，这些项目是成功的保证。但是体育就在我们面前。体育真的是.。艰苦的和大多数运动的人并不是一直都在成功。这件事，怎么回事.里面的东西.。有人知道这里的棒球吗？棒球里所谓的错误是什么？比如呢不，只是去外地。

Speaker 7: Oh, error.

演讲者7：哦，错了。

Allen K: Yeah, what's an error in baseball? Not catching a fly ball. How good are the  average fielders? They're 98.5% effective. So really good ones are like 1% error, so an  error in technical stuff is designed to build a computer system and failing to build  it. Like anybody should be able ... Or deciding to build a software system and  failing to build it. You just should be able to knock that off. But you're  in this other range when you're trying to do design. And it's really two different  things. So here's a memo Lick wrote.

艾伦·K：是的，棒球有什么错误？不接飞球。一般的野手有多好？有效率为98.5%。所以真正好的错误就像1%的错误，所以技术上的错误被设计用来建立一个计算机系统，而不能建立它。就像任何人都应该能够.。或者决定建立一个软件系统，却没有建立它。你应该能把它停下来。但当你想做设计的时候你在另一个范围内。实际上是两件不同的事情。这是Lick写的一份备忘录。

In 63, shortly after he got this initial  money from RPA to members and affiliates of the intergalactic computing network. And they asked  him, "Why did you call it that" and he said, "Well engineers always give you  the minimum and I want to network that spans the entire planet and so I'm  asking for an intergalactic one". And when they scale it down, we'll still get the  ... So that's where the internet came from. Literally. The original name of the internet  was the intergalactic computing, and nobody knew how to do it back then. Packet, packet  switching had not been invented in 63. And here's a nice line in that memo,  if we succeed in making an intergalactic then our main problem will be learning to  communicate with aliens and he meant this in the biggest possible way and I don't  have time to really explain it, it's really interesting. People who are interested should write  me an email. Didn't mean just other people, he meant other software. Other computers. He  meant, what does it mean to communicate when you scale things up? So this guy  was a big thinker. Number nine, you can't think inside the belt way. That's of  course referring to Washington DC, but this is a general principal. And they asked him  why and he said "well because there's too much noise, there's too much politics, there's  too much bullshit and nobody does research in Washington DC". So the last thing we  want to do as RPA funders is to try and think while we're there. Our  job is to get money out of the government and pass it along. So a  solution to that was say "Hey, let's not be here for longer than two years".  And so every two years Lick set up the process to get his successor, happened  that Ivan Sutherland got drafted into the army at just the right time. And so  they grabbed him. So at age 26 Ivan ran this whole show and man was  he good. So he was a second lieutenant, chairing meetings with generals and one of  the most famous things recalled of that, some generals going on and on at some  point Ivan said "General, you have just two minutes to make your point if you  have one". That's about the simplest way of describing Ivan. Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts,  those are the four that made this happen. Taylor is special because he also is  the guy who setup PARC. An he was a student of Lick Lyder. Lick Lyder  was intuitively wonderful. Taylor was a student of what was wonderful about Lick Lyder, he  could explain everything that Lick Lyder could do and why it worked. So here's a  couple of things I'm not going to go on about, but basically the idea here  is, it isn't like, let's look around and see what is available and what we  can do with it. The idea was, stick with the vision and just make every  frigging thing that's necessary. Doesn't matter what it is.

在63年，不久之后，他从RPA获得了最初的资金给星系间计算网络的成员和附属机构。他们问他，“你为什么这么称呼它”，他说，“工程师总是给你最低限度的，我想建立一个跨越整个星球的网络，所以我想要一个星际的。”当他们缩小规模的时候，我们还是会得到.这就是互联网的来源。从字面上说。互联网最初的名字是星际计算，当时没有人知道怎么做。分组，分组交换还没有在63年被发明出来。在备忘录中有一句很好的台词，如果我们成功地制造了一个星际星系，那么我们的主要问题将是学会与外星人沟通，他的意思是，这是以最大可能的方式实现的，我没有时间去真正解释，这真的很有趣。有兴趣的人应该给我写封电子邮件。不只是其他人，他指的是其他软件。其他电脑。他的意思是，当你把事情放大的时候，沟通意味着什么？所以这家伙是个大思想家。第九，你不能在腰带里思考。这当然是指华盛顿特区，但这是一个普遍的原则。他们问他为什么，他说：“好吧，因为有太多的噪音，太多的政治，太多的胡说八道，没有人在华盛顿特区进行研究”。因此，作为RPA的资助者，我们最不想做的就是在那里的时候尝试思考。我们的工作是把钱从政府中拿出来，然后把钱传递出去。所以解决这个问题的办法是“嘿，让我们在这里呆不超过两年”。于是，每隔两年，利克就建立起接班人的程序，伊万·萨瑟兰(Ivan Sutherland)在合适的时机应征入伍。所以他们抓住了他。所以，在26岁的时候，伊凡主持了整个节目，而他是个好人。因此，他是一名少尉，主持与将军们的会议，其中一件最著名的事情是，一些将领在某一时刻不停地说：“将军，如果你有一个，你只有两分钟的时间来说明你的观点。”这是描述伊凡最简单的方式。鲍勃·泰勒和拉里·罗伯茨，这是促成这一切的四个因素。泰勒很特别，因为他也是设计帕里克的人。他是利克·莱德的学生。舔莱德直觉上很棒。泰勒是利克·莱德的一个学生，他可以解释莱克·莱德所能做的一切，以及为什么成功。这里有几件事我不打算继续，但基本上这里的想法不是，让我们四处看看，看看有什么可用的，我们能用它做些什么。我的想法是，坚持愿景，把每件必须做的事都做好。不管是什么。

If we have to make a  new kind of integrated circuit we'll do it. All of these things were done. So  it's very much like these other cultures where nobody worried about whether you had a  half centimeter radar in building 20 at MIT, they just did it. And here's one  that is really a bug today. And if you don't have the chops, yeah you  shouldn't make your tools. You shouldn't make your own operating system, you shouldn't make your  own programming language because that's not what you're trying to do.

如果我们必须制造一种新的集成电路，我们就去做。所有这些事情都已经做好了。就像其他文化一样，没有人担心麻省理工学院的20楼里有没有半厘米的雷达，他们就是这么做的。这里有一个今天真的是个bug。如果你没有排骨，是的，你不应该做你的工具。你不应该制造你自己的操作系统，你不应该制作你自己的编程语言，因为这不是你想要做的。

If you do have  the chops, and you better not do this unless you have the chops, then you  have to make your own hardware and software and operating system and programming languages. Otherwise,  you're working in the past on some vendor's bad idea of what computing is about.  So part of what Picasso said. You have to get really much much better than  most people want to today. And here's another reversal, today people buy hardware and put  software on it basically to make the hardware look good. The RPA community and PARC  did exactly the opposite, started off with the software, using super computers to simulate the  thing and when you got the software the way you wanted it, then you designed  a computer that would optimize and make more efficient what you're doing on a super  computer. That was what Sketch Pad was. Nobody thought that the next graphic systems were  going to be done on a computer the size of this building. Okay? And then  make a bunch of them. So almost every project in the RPA project, they actually  made enough of them so they could be used as tools. They weren't just demos.  And so part of this invention process had to require a kind of limited engineering,  PARC for instance had a thing where whatever you did, you had to make 100  of them. Made an ethernet, it had to run 100 machines.

如果你有排骨，你最好不要这样做，除非你有排骨，那么你必须制作自己的硬件和软件，操作系统和编程语言。否则，您将在过去研究某个供应商对计算是什么的错误想法。这是毕加索所说的一部分。你必须变得比今天大多数人想要的要好得多。这是另一个逆转，今天人们购买硬件，并把软件放在它基本上是为了使硬件看起来很好。RPA社区和Parc做的正好相反，从软件开始，用超级计算机来模拟，当你以你想要的方式得到软件时，你设计了一台计算机来优化和提高你在超级计算机上所做的事情的效率。这就是Sketch Pad的风格。没有人认为下一个图形系统将在这座大楼大小的计算机上完成。好吧然后做一堆。因此，RPA项目中的几乎每一个项目，实际上都有足够的数量，这样就可以作为工具使用。他们不只是演示。所以这个发明过程的一部分需要一种有限的工程，比如Parc有一个东西，不管你做了什么，你都必须制造100个。制造了一个以太网，它必须运行100台机器。

If you made a  time sharing system it had to run 100 users.

如果您制作了一个分时系统，它必须运行100个用户。

If you made personal computer you  had to be able to build 100 of them. Learn how to argue. This is  what you learned as a graduate student there. Argue for clarity, not to win.

如果你制造了个人电脑，你必须能够制造出100台这样的电脑。学会如何争论。这是你在那里读研究生时学到的。主张清晰，而不是为了赢。

It's  the biggest bug today. People are always contending with each other, trying to be winners  and losers, and that's one of the problems with Washington, they've forgotten what their job  is. No. What we have to do is understand the complicated things. Here's a big-ee,  every researcher at PARC was a second or third generation Phd that RPA had created.  Right? Eight years, so it wasn't just the stuff in the past.

这是今天最大的问题。人们总是互相竞争，试图成为赢家和输家，这是华盛顿的问题之一，他们已经忘记了他们的工作是什么。否我们要做的是理解复杂的事情。这是一位大人物，帕里克的每一位研究员都是RPA创造的第二代或第三代博士。对吗？八年了，所以这不只是过去的事。

I'll show you  a couple more of those while we're getting close to ... But it was creating  the next generation. Again, this is baseball. Baseball you don't, you have to have form,  you have to develop talent going all the way down to little league. And they  did. And the other thing is a little difficult to ... Some of you will  understand this readily. That the reward of doing this stuff wasn't the reward of making  it happen, because a lot of times it didn't happen.

在我们接近.但它正在创造下一代。再说一遍，这是棒球。棒球你不需要，你必须有形式，你必须培养人才，一直到小联盟。他们做到了。另一件事有点难.你们中的一些人很快就会明白这一点。做这件事的回报不是让它发生的回报，因为很多时候它没有发生。

It was the reward of  actually being funded to work on what the actual problems were.

这是实际获得资金来解决实际问题的回报。

I can't emphasize this  too much. Working on what the problems actually are rather than something that's going to  get a paper, something that's going to make you money ... But taking big human  problems could be something like drinkable water for the 70% of the planet that doesn't  have it. Doesn't matter. There is no other goal.

我怎么强调都不过分。研究问题实际上是什么，而不是什么东西会得到一份文件，一些能让你赚钱的东西.但是，对于地球上没有饮用水的70%的国家来说，人类面临的大问题可能就像饮用水一样。不重要。没有其他目标。

If you pick one of those  things that's a great one, worth putting a life into. Okay. So, background was partially  tinkering, a lot of people came from new york. Down where the World Trade Center  was. Before the World Trade Center there was about a mile across Manhattan island that  was nothing but electronic surplus stores. Mow a few lawns, put a dime into the  subway and you could go down there and buy almost anything to mess around with.  And that group got used to ... Everybody was broke. So, but you could build  your own ... Like there was a kit to build your own oscilloscope. And if  you wanted an oscilloscope and you were broke, you could get one of these on  time for 30 or 40 bucks and build it. And ...

如果你选择了其中的一件，那是一件很棒的事情，值得你投入一生。好的。所以，背景是部分修补，许多人来自纽约。就在世贸中心。在世界贸易中心(WorldTradeCenter)之前，在曼哈顿岛上大约有一英里远的地方，只不过是电子剩余的商店。修剪几片草坪，把一角钱放进地铁，你就可以去那里买任何东西。那群人习惯了.。每个人都破产了。所以，但是你可以建立你自己的.。就像有一套工具可以建造你自己的示波器。如果你想要一个示波器，而你已经破产了，你可以花30或40美元准时买到一个示波器，然后建造它。还有.。

I'm going to just  put ... These are just washed out anyway, so I'm just going to go past.  Okay so Morris law, this is the original thing in Morris' paper, doubling every year,  he picked MOS silicon which is too slow to make things out of but we  get faster if you made it smaller, here's doubling every two years and what happened,  the prediction was 30 years and so what happened was very in line with doubling  every tow years to every eighteen months. And there is physics behind this, this wasn't  just an engineering aspiration. And so if you believe this, you had something really worthwhile.  I'm going to skip past Englebart here ...

我要把.。反正这些都被冲掉了，所以我要过去了。好的，莫里斯定律，这是莫里斯论文中最初的东西，每年加倍，他选择了MOS硅，太慢了，不能用它来制造东西，但是如果你让它变小，我们会变得更快，这里每两年翻一番，发生了什么，预测是30年，所以发生的事情非常符合每两年翻一倍，每18个月一次。这背后有物理学，这不仅仅是一个工程上的愿望。所以，如果你相信这一点，你就会发现一些很有价值的东西。我要跳过这里的恩格尔巴特.。

I think you should see a little  of this though. Cause at the same time the mouse was invented, this was done  at Rand and how did the Rand people go about it? Well, at midnight they  would go through people's waste paper baskets to see how they worked. What were they  throwing away? And people were .. What people were doing when they were working was  making all kinds of diagrams, little flow charts and all of this stuff, so they  said, okay well let's invent the first tablet ...

不过，我想你应该看看这个。因为在老鼠发明的同时，这是在兰德做的，兰德人是怎么做的呢？午夜的时候，他们会翻看人们的废纸篮子，看看他们是如何工作的。他们扔掉了什么？人们是.。人们在工作时所做的是制作各种图表、小流程图和所有这些东西，所以他们说，好吧，让我们发明第一个平板电脑.

Is good as most of the  tablets you've ever used today. The hallmark of these people is they generally did it  good enough and heres ...

和你今天使用过的大多数药片一样好。这些人的特点是他们做得很好，这里.

Video : You start to edit the flow diagram. First we erase a then move the connector  all the way so that we may draw a box in its place. The printing  in the box is being used as commentary only in this case. The box is  slightly too large so we may change its size. Then draw a flow from the  connector to the box. Attach a decision element to the box and draw a flow  from it to scan. We then erase the flow ...

视频：你开始编辑流程图。首先，我们删除一个，然后移动连接器所有的方式，以便我们可以画一个盒子在它的位置。只有在这种情况下，方框中的打印才被用作评论。这个盒子有点太大了，所以我们可以改变它的尺寸。然后从连接器到盒绘制一个流。将决策元素附加到框中，并从中抽取一个流进行扫描。然后我们抹去水流.。

Allen K: Okay so this is about 1968 or so, big room sized main-frame with one guy.  But this system really, what you could ask your question more even about this, this  system was one of the best systems I've ever used and every ...

艾伦K：好吧，这大约是1968年左右，一个人的大房间大小的主框架。但是这个系统真的，你可以问你更多的问题，这个系统是我使用过的最好的系统之一，而且每一个.

It felt  so intimate, it was so different from the mouse. You know, I was one of  the things that we, that we actually looked at.

它感觉如此亲密，它与老鼠是如此不同。你知道，我是我们真正观察过的事情之一。

I guess I do have to  show the next ... The next thing here. Just so you think that the VR  wasn't something done recently, but the second thing Ivan did after he came back, the  thing when he came back from RPA was to do this.

我想我得展示下一个.。接下来的事。所以你认为虚拟现实不是最近做的事情，但是伊凡回来后做的第二件事，他从卢旺达爱国军回来的时候就是这样做的。

I worked on this  when I was a graduate student. You could grab things, you had a thing in  your hand. Grab things and move them around and ...

我还是个研究生的时候就做过这件事。你可以拿东西，你手里有东西。把东西拿来搬去.

It's a little exciting because  instead of the thing that you used today in VR it had two CRTs with  1500 watts right about your ears crackling away. So that's a very exciting thing to  do, and of course one of hardest things was to do good head positioning back  then, there are many ways of doing ... One of the things they did here,  I won't explain what it is, but it was hooked to a crane. So as  you walked around this big room at MIT a crane would ... Follow ... Would  automatically follow you with the positioning thing over your head to find out what ...  what this was about. And oh man.

这有点令人兴奋，因为与你今天在虚拟现实中使用的东西不同，它有两个1500瓦的CRT，就在你的耳朵发出劈啪作响的声音。所以这是一件非常令人兴奋的事情，当然，最困难的事情之一是做好当时的头部定位，有很多种方法.他们在这里做的事情之一，我不会解释它是什么，但它是挂在起重机上的。所以当你在麻省理工学院的这间大房间里走来走去的时候.跟着.。会自动跟着你头顶上的定位装置找出.这是怎么回事。还有哦伙计。

I'm getting killed because I should stop right  now. But, I really have two more things to do.

我要被杀了因为我现在应该停下来。但是，我真的还有两件事要做。

If you could give me  two more minutes I will ... First one here is, this is something you have  to think about. Let time go one way and progress go the other way. Yay,  boo, yay, boo.

如果你能再给我两分钟我会.。首先，这是你必须考虑的问题。让时间走一条路，让进步走另一条路。是的，是的。

It goes up it goes down. This is the way that people  tend to measure things. Problem is, they never put in a threshold. Put in a  threshold then the only things above the threshold count, like these are reading scores, they  ... Nothing counts. Reading scores never get above threshold. So it doesn't matter whether they  go up or down. And what is actually needed changes over time. You need more  and if you're measuring to a baseline, which people usually do, one of the ways  of improving things or making it look like you're not doing such a bad job  is to lower the baseline. For example Apple completely lowered the baseline on what constitutes  reasonable user interface for Iphones and Ipads.

它上升了，下降了。这就是人们测量事物的方式。问题是，他们从来没有设定过门槛。加一个门槛，那么唯一高于阈值的东西，像这些是阅读分数，他们.什么都不重要。阅读成绩永远不会超过门槛。所以不管它们是上升还是下降。什么是真正需要的随着时间的推移而改变。你需要更多，如果你测量到一个基线，人们通常会这样做，改善事物或使它看起来你做得不那么糟糕的方法之一就是降低基线。例如，苹果完全降低了iPhone和iPad的合理用户界面的基准。

Interfaces on the systems before hand had an  undo and these don't. And I can think of 15 more things. Think about it.  So what they did, is they decided, "Well we're just, we're just not going to  work on all of those problems anymore. We're going to condition the unsophisticated public to  do work at the level of a two year old or a 92 year old.  And we're just going to eliminate everything in between". And the public has bought it.  Because you don't want to count noses when you're looking for quality. People can be  talked into anything. So what you have to do on this stuff, is you have  to pick something that is absolutely above that line. We call that the Boot Mcrae  sweet spot. He's the guy who did man powered flight. And once you have achieved  that, it opens up a whole region that you can explore, and that's what we  did at PARC. A moonshot was set space travel back 50 years. Everybody uses this  metaphor "We need a moonshot". No we don't need a moonshot. You don't do space  travel with chemical rocketry. And what's interesting about the people who like ... Jeff Bezos  and yeah , they don't get it. MV equals MV. Every child who read science  fiction in the 50s knew this. What that means is, either have to carry a  shit load of reaction mass with you if you're doing chemicals because you can't get  the velocity high enough, so you have to out out a lot of mass and  if you do that, you have to lift that mass. So you wind up with  45 story building rockets just to get into orbit. That is nuts. Anyway, I will  not go on that ... So, but the thing that was a tragedy was that  there are very good proposals for how to get that high exhaust velocity using various  forms of atomic power and it was something that the public was not interested in.  The moonshot was not about space travel. Okay, so, I'll skip past this. Because I  want to end with, oh yeah here's the ... So this tablet computer I thought  up in 1968, it had two initial forms. One was the familiar tablet, and the  other was what Ivan's head display was inevitable with Morris law. And then Nicolas Nigriponie  had this idea of wearing a watch and communicating with the rest of the world.  Okay. So here's the last little segment and then I'll let you go. Wayne Gretzky,  you know who Wayne Gretzky is.

在手动之前，系统上的接口有一个撤销，而这些没有。我还能想到更多的15件事。好好想想。所以他们做了什么，他们决定，“好吧，我们只是，我们不再去解决所有这些问题了。我们要让那些不成熟的公众去做两岁或九十二岁的工作。我们只是要在这两者之间消除一切。”公众已经买下了它。因为你不想在追求质量的时候数鼻子。人们可以被说服做任何事。所以你要做的是，你必须选择绝对高于这条线的东西。我们称它为Boot McRae甜点。他就是那个给人提供动力飞行的人。一旦你做到了这一点，它就开辟了一个你可以探索的整个区域，这就是我们在Parc所做的。50年前的太空旅行中就有一次登月。每个人都用这个比喻“我们需要一个月光”。不需要月影。你不使用化学火箭进行太空旅行。有趣的是那些喜欢的人.。杰夫·贝佐斯和是的，他们不明白。MV等于MV。每一个50年代读科幻小说的孩子都知道这一点。这意味着，如果你做的是化学物质，你必须携带大量的反应质量，因为速度不能达到足够高，所以你必须排出大量的质量，如果你这样做的话，你必须提升这个质量。所以你得到45层楼高的火箭只是为了进入轨道。真是疯了。不管怎么说，我不会再那么做了.所以，但悲剧的是，对于如何利用各种形式的原子能来获得高排放速度，有很多很好的建议，这是公众不感兴趣的事情。月球不是关于太空旅行的。好吧，所以，我跳过这个。因为我想结束，哦，是的，这是.我在1968年发明的这台平板电脑有两种初始形式。一个是熟悉的平板电脑，另一个是伊万的头部展示不可避免的莫里斯定律。然后尼古拉斯·尼格里庞妮想到了戴着手表和世界其他地方交流的想法。好的。这是最后一个小片段，然后我就放你走。韦恩·格雷茨基你知道韦恩·格雷茨基是谁。

I'll bet, famous hockey , and he was just  a little guy. He tried to avoid fights. They asked him why he took so  many shots on goal, he said, "Well you miss 100% of the shots you don't  take". So he wasn't trying to be careful. He scored more goals than anybody in  history by 1000. So, the fact that his percentage of misses was also high was  irrelevant. And they asked him why he was better than anybody else, and he said  "Well, a good hockey player goes to where the puck is, a bright one goes  to where the puck is going to be" and he didn't mean tracking the puck.  He meant getting into a place where somebody could pass him the puck where he  could make a goal. So what he did, was he looked at the entire configuration,  saw where the future was going to be and went to that place in the  ... So you can make a game to invent the future out of this. So,  you start off with cosmic goodness intuition, like for me the tablet one was good.  You identify a favorable exponential, like Morris law. You take the cosmic intuition out 30  years and you ask "Can we say, wouldn't it be ridiculous if we didn't have  this" and 30 years out, 30 years way, well of course we'll have one. That's  what that exponential means. And bring it back to the 10-15 year point, at that  point you can just pay money because that's also what Morris law and what Turing  means, is if you pay a lot of money now you can make the commodity  computer of 10-15 years in the future, that's what the Alto was.

我敢打赌，著名的曲棍球，他只是个小个子。他尽量避免打架。他们问他为什么在球门上射门这么多，他说：“好吧，你错过了100%的投篮，你没有射门。”所以他不是想小心。他进的球比历史上任何人都多。因此，他的失误率也很高，这是无关紧要的。他们问他为什么他比任何人都优秀，他说：“好吧，一个优秀的曲棍球运动员会去冰球所在的地方，一个明亮的曲棍球会跑到冰球将要出现的地方。”而他并不是有意去追踪冰球。他的意思是进入一个有人可以把球传给他的地方，在那里他可以进球。所以他做了什么，他看了整个配置，看到了未来的未来，然后去了那个地方，在.所以你可以做一个游戏来创造未来。所以，你从宇宙善良的直觉开始，就像对我来说，平板电脑是好的。你确定了一个指数，就像莫里斯定律。你拿出30年的宇宙直觉，你会问：“我们能不能说，如果我们没有这个，那岂不是荒谬吗？”30年后，我们当然会有这样的直觉。这就是指数的意思。把它带回到10到15年的时间点，那时你就可以付钱了，因为这也是莫里斯定律和图灵的意思，如果你现在花了很多钱，你就可以在未来10到15年的时间里制造出一台商品电脑，这就是阿尔托。

It was about  50 times faster than what you got out of time sharing terminal. And make a  bunch of them. And you intertwine it with the ... So run the software and  then you can do two kinds of computing in the future. One kind of computing  is zillions of experiments to get a user interface that would be universal for ...  right now 5 billion people, and deal with millions of people that you've never, who  are doing applications you've never seen before. And the other thing you can do, the  thing on the right there is Microsoft Word as it was at Xerox PARC in  1974, if you optimized the code, you could get what the applications are going to  be ten years out. So those are the two things you can do by doing  this super computer thing. And it costs money, in today's dollars those Altos cost about  125k a piece. And we made 2000 of them. Think about that. You've got to  be a funder who's serious, XEROX went batshit when we did it. They really went  batshit when we wanted to cash them in.

它比你从分时终端得到的速度快50倍。做一堆。你把它和.所以，运行软件，然后你可以做两种计算在未来。一种计算是无数的实验，以获得一个用户界面将是通用的.现在有50亿人，和你从未见过的数以百万计的人打交道，他们在做你从未见过的应用程序。你能做的另一件事是，右边是微软Word，就像1974年在施乐Parc公司做的那样，如果你优化了代码，你就能得到10年后的应用程序。所以，这是两件事，你可以做这个超级计算机的事情。这需要钱，以今天的美元计算，ALTOS的价格约为125，000美元。我们用它们做了2000件。想想看。你必须是个认真的赞助者，施乐公司在我们做这件事的时候，他是个混蛋。当我们想把他们兑现的时候，他们真的疯了。

I'll just leave you this, since I'm  over time now.

我把这个留给你，因为我已经过了一段时间。

I'll leave you this as ... One of the ways of escaping  the present, have glimmer of an idea, take it so far out that you don't  have to worry about how you're going to get there, and then you just bring  it back. So instead of innovating out from the present, what you want to do  is invent the future from the future. Go out and live in the future and  bring the future back. Thank you.


我把这个留给你作为.。逃避现在的方法之一，有一线想法，把它带到如此远的地方，你不必担心你将如何到达那里，然后你就把它带回来。所以，你要做的不是从现在开始创新，而是从未来创造未来。走出去，活在未来，把未来带回来。谢谢。
