# Startup Mechanics - Kirsty Nathoo

#启动机制-KirstidNathoo

Steven: Before we start, I wanted to introduce our speaker today. Kristy Nathoo is the CFO  and a partner at Y Combinator. She has basically worked virtually with every company that  has gone through YC. From incorporations to fundraising to hiring to exists. Kristy's pretty much  seen it all. Today she'll talk to you about start-up mechanics.

史蒂文：在我们开始之前，我今天想介绍一下我们的演讲者。KristyNathoo是Y Combinator的首席财务官和合伙人。她基本上已经和每一家通过YC考试的公司合作过。从公司到募捐再到雇佣到存在。克里斯蒂几乎都看到了。今天她会跟你谈谈启动机制。

Kristy Nathoo: Thank you. Hi everyone. Thanks for coming in to listen to this. As Steven said,  this lecture is about start-up mechanics, which is going to cover some of the basic  issues that most start-ups will face as they go through the early days of becoming  a real company.

克里斯蒂：谢谢你。大家好。谢谢你来听这个。正如史蒂文所说，这节课是关于启动机制的，它将涵盖大多数初创企业在成长为真正公司的初期将面临的一些基本问题。

I'm really only talking about the basics here. There's a lot of  complexity and there's a lot of other things that happen. But this will give you  some ideas of the things you should know about and some of the resources out  there that there is to help you with those.

我在这里只谈一些基本的问题。这里有很多复杂的事情，还有很多其他的事情正在发生。但是这会给你一些关于你应该知道的事情的想法，以及一些可以帮助你解决这些问题的资源。

I know that we are standing  here in California at the moment, but a lot of this stuff will apply to  any start-ups, no matter where they are in the world.

我知道我们现在站在加州，但是很多这些东西都适用于任何一家初创公司，不管他们在哪里。

I'll talk a little bit  throughout the session about the things that are US specific and things that are specific  to the rest of the world. This is definitely not the glamorous part of being  a start-up founder. You'll hear from all sorts of people throughout the rest of this  course about all the glamorous things and all the other things. These are nuts and  bolts that, if you take of in the early days, you stick with the simple  stranded basic processes, you don't try to reinvent new voting structures or anything like that,  it will be enough. On the flip side, if you don't do some of these  basics, then the company down the road will come into some problems that will cost  a lot of time, effort and money to get solved.

在整个会议期间，我将谈论一些美国特有的事情和世界其他地区特有的事情。这绝对不是创业公司创始人的魅力所在。在这门课的其余时间里，你会从各种各样的人那里听到所有迷人的事情和其他的事情。这些都是一些具体的细节，如果你在早期的时候，坚持简单的基本程序，你就不会试图重新创造新的投票结构或诸如此类的东西，这就足够了。另一方面，如果你不做一些基本的工作，那么公司就会遇到一些问题，需要花费大量的时间、精力和金钱来解决。

I'll bring up a few  stories as we go through of situations where that's happened. These are the topics that  we're going to cover today. We're going to go through the lifecycle of a company.  Again, start in the early days of forming, going through raising some money, hiring some  people, giving out shares. The first step in this is the formation of the company.  Formation creates a separate legal entity. What that means is the entity that will pay  its own taxes, be responsible for its own assets, for its own liabilities, sign its  own contracts, sue and be sued.

在我们讲述发生这种情况的时候，我会讲几个故事。这些都是我们今天要讨论的话题。我们要经历一家公司的生命周期。再一次，从成立初期开始，通过筹集一些资金，雇佣一些人，发放股票。这其中的第一步是公司的成立。成立一个独立的法律实体。这意味着实体将自己纳税，对自己的资产负责，对自己的负债负责，签署自己的合同，起诉和被起诉。

It's all independent of the owners, so you as  a founder would be independent of the company.

这一切都是独立于业主，所以你作为一个创始人将独立于公司。

In the US this kind of company  is called a C corp, a corporation. There are other structures that are out there  for entities to form, but in the case of start-ups, who are expecting to be  successful and to grow and to raise money and to eventually IPO, then a C  corp is the way to go.

在美国，这种公司被称为C公司，一家公司。还有其他一些机构可以由实体组成，但对于初创企业来说，它们期望成功、成长、筹集资金，并最终上市，那么C公司就是出路所在。

Investors can only really invest in C corps. There's  a lot of other things that come in if you decide to go down some  other route. You may hear some advice from people who aren't necessarily in the start-up  world to start with a LLC or something like that, which might work in the  short term, but then as you become more successful, more in need of raising money,  you will have to convert to a C corp.

投资者只能真正地投资于C军。如果你决定走其他路线的话，还有很多其他的事情要做。你可能会听到一些人的建议，这些人不一定是在创业世界里才从有限责任公司开始的，这在短期内可能会奏效，但当你变得更加成功，更需要筹集资金时，你将不得不转换为C公司。

It probably make sense, if you  are thinking about doing a start-up in that situation to start with the C corp.  Terminology gets a little bit loose here and I'm as guilty as everyone. But through  the whole of this session, when we're generally talking about this, basically the words company,  C corp, corporation, entity, start-up, all mean the same thing. They all mean this separate  legal entity that is a C corp. The hardest part in formation though, is deciding  actually when to incorporate this company. Because obviously with the separate legal entity comes a  lot of admin and various other processes that have to happen around that.

如果你想在这种情况下创业，从C公司开始，这可能是有意义的。术语在这里有点松散，我和每个人一样有罪。但是在整个过程中，当我们讨论这个问题的时候，基本上，公司，C公司，实体，创业，都意味着同样的事情。它们都是指这个独立的法律实体，即C公司。不过，在组建过程中，最困难的部分是决定何时合并这家公司。因为很明显，有了独立的法律实体，就会有很多管理和其他各种程序围绕着它发生。

It's one  of those situation where you don't want to do it too soon, but you also  don't want to do it too late. Too soon would probably be, if you're still  throwing around ideas, you're still thinking about this as a side project, you're not sure  if you're going to be doing this for a long time, you don't know if  you're going to be working with the co-founders. All of those I would suggest that  you don't incorporate at this point. However, the flip side of that is, if you're  at the stage where you are creating significant demands of IP that you want to  make sure it's clearly owned, particularly if there's more than one of you creating the  IP, then that would be a situation where you would want to incorporate. Another situation  is if you've built a product that you're now ready to start charging for, so  you can create a separate entity that takes the money in for the products that  you're charging, you want the separate bank account, you want a company bank account and  a personal account, you don't want to intermingle those dollars. Actually Stripe has a product  called Stripe Atlas, which basically helps founders to form a company to the point where  they can get a bank account to make them start accepting payments through Stripe. The  other reason why you would want to incorporate is just to protect you as individuals.  Because again, as I was saying, a separate entity means that all of the liabilities  and anything else that happens there, would be on a company rather than you as  an individual.

这是一种情况，你不想做得太快，但你也不想做得太晚。可能太早了，如果你还在胡思乱想，你仍然把这当作一个附带项目，你不确定你是否会这么做很长时间，你不知道你是否会和联合创始人一起工作。所有这些，我建议你不要在这一点上合并。然而，另一方面，如果您正处于创建大量IP需求的阶段，您希望确保它是明确拥有的，特别是如果您有不止一个创建IP，那么这将是一种您希望合并的情况。另一种情况是，如果你已经建立了一个你现在就可以开始收费的产品，那么你可以创建一个独立的实体，为你收取的产品收取资金，你想要独立的银行账户，你想要一个公司的银行账户和一个个人账户，你不想把这些钱混为一谈。实际上，Stripe有一个名为Stripe Atlas的产品，它基本上可以帮助创始人组建一家公司，这样他们就可以获得一个银行账户，让他们开始接受通过Stripe支付的款项。你想加入的另一个原因是为了保护你作为个人。因为，就像我刚才说的，一个单独的实体意味着所有的负债和发生在那里的任何事情，都将由公司承担，而不是你作为个人。

If you get into the situation where that might come important, again, it's  a good idea to incorporate. All right, at YC we strongly believe that the US  is the best place to incorporate a company, regardless of where the founders come from  or where they are when they're actually incorporating. The reason for this is that the  vast majority of the capital that's available to start-ups is here in the US. Generally,  US investors struggle to invest in non-US companies. There are some exceptions and it is  possible, but generally it causes problems. When you are going through the process of incorporation,  you don't actually have to be physically in the US whilst you are incorporating. Then  in the US you can incorporate your company in any of the 50 states. You  don't have to, again, be physically located in that state. You don't have to be  planning to do any business in that state. Actually, for start-ups and for a lot  of companies actually, the state that most start-ups will incorporate in is Delaware. The reason  being is that Delaware lawyers highly developed, pretty much all lawyers who are working on  corporate law in the US know Delaware law.

如果你陷入这种情况，这可能是重要的，再一次，这是一个好主意，合并。好吧，在YC，我们坚信美国是最好的合并公司的地方，不管创始人是从哪里来的，或者他们实际上是在哪里合并的。这样做的原因是，绝大多数可供初创企业使用的资本都在美国。一般来说，美国投资者很难投资于非美国公司。有一些例外，这是可能的，但一般情况下，它会引起问题。当你进入公司的过程中，你实际上并不需要在美国的身体，而你正在融入。然后在美国，你可以在50个州中的任何一个州成立你的公司。你不需要，再一次，身体上的位置，在那个状态。你不必计划在那个州做任何生意。实际上，对于初创企业和许多公司来说，大多数初创企业将加入的州是特拉华州。原因是特拉华州的律师高度发达，几乎所有在美国从事公司法工作的律师都知道特拉华州的法律。

Investors expect to see Delaware companies, Delaware  law allows companies the most flexibility in terms of issuing shares and various other things.  Also has the best privacy protections for you as owners.

投资者希望看到特拉华州的公司，特拉华州的法律允许公司在发行股票和其他各种事情上具有最大的灵活性。也有最好的隐私保护为您作为业主。

It makes a lot of  sense to incorporate in Delaware, because again, this is one of this situations where there's  not point in trying to do something different. Just go with the head on this.  Again, you can incorporate in Delaware as non-US citizens, you can incorporate in Delaware when  you are not physically in the US. There's no problems there. All right, let's move  on to actually how we incorporate.

在特拉华州合并是很有意义的，因为同样，这是一种没有意义尝试做不同事情的情况之一。把头放在上面就行了。同样，你可以在特拉华州注册为非美国公民，当你不在美国时，你也可以加入特拉华州。那里没有问题。好吧，让我们继续讨论我们是如何结合的。

It's a two step process. The first part is  simply faxing a couple of forms into Delaware to say, "I would like to create  an entity." It takes about 24 hours for them to process and to get the  entity formed. Once that entity is being formed, then the second step in the process  is to adopt by laws for the company, which talk about how the company is  going to be governed. Create a board, appoint directors to that board, appoint offices, to  assign IP to the company, so you as individuals then anything you start creating is  owned by the company. Also to give out shares in the company, so to assign  ownership in the company. The final couple of those, so assigning IP and buying shares.  I'm going to talk about a little bit more detailed. The other three are very  legal and complex.

这是一个两步的过程。第一部分是将几个表单传真到特拉华州，说：“我想创建一个实体。”他们需要大约24小时的时间来处理和建立实体。一旦该实体成立，那么第二步是通过法律为公司，其中讨论公司将如何治理。成立一个董事会，任命董事会的董事，指定办公室，分配知识产权给公司，这样你作为个人，那么你开始创建的任何东西都是公司所有。也是为了分配公司的股份，所以要转让公司的所有权。最后一对，所以分配IP和购买股票。我要讲的更详细一点。另外三个是非常合法和复杂的。

I won't go into those here. Suffice is to say that there  is a couple of different options that you can use to do this. The first  one is to just use a lawyer. A lot of companies will just hire a  lawyer to do this. That's a great option, especially if you want to do something  a little bit non standard in some way or you need some kind of high  touch service there.

我不会进入这些的。只要说有几个不同的选项可以用来做这件事就够了。第一个就是请律师。很多公司都会雇个律师来做这件事。这是一个很好的选择，特别是如果你想在某种程度上做一些不标准的事情，或者你需要某种高触摸服务。

It usually costs in the region of three to five thousand dollars  plus filing fees to incorporate a company with a lawyer. There's loads of lawyers here  in the valley and most of those for start-ups will actually deffer their fees until  you raise money. Often those fees can be pushed back and you don't have to  pay those immediately. However, what doesn't work with lawyers is if you have a friend  or a cousin who lives in Alabama and is a real estate property lawyer and  having them doing the incorporation documents, because they didn't understand how start-ups work, they don't  understand what the standard things are that start-up documents include. Things could go wrong. An  example os this is we had a company that came to us in YC that  we founded and they came to us as LLC formed in Connecticut. The reason why  they've done that is because the founder's friends who were lawyers in Connecticut told them  to do that. When we said we were going to invest they decided that they  were going to convert this, at that point, to a Delaware C corp. They used  their Connecticut lawyers to do this. Which is great. However, three founding rounders later when  the company was raising huge amounts of money, a new law firm that they'd hired  here in the valley actually discovered that that conversion had been done wrong by the  Connecticut lawyers. Therefore, it was not valid. They'd made a very simple mistake, but as  a result it wasn't valid. They had to put the founding round on hold and  they had to sort this out before they could raise the money.

通常情况下，在3到5000美元的范围内注册一家律师公司，再加上备案费。山谷里有很多律师，而大多数初创公司的律师实际上都会在你筹到钱之前支付律师费。通常情况下，这些费用可以被推回，你不必立即支付这些费用。然而，如果你有一个朋友或表弟住在阿拉巴马州，是一名房地产律师，让他们做公司文件，因为他们不知道初创公司是如何运作的，他们不知道启动文件包括哪些标准内容，这对律师来说是行不通的。事情可能会出错。举个例子，我们有一家在YC成立的公司，他们是在康涅狄格州成立的。他们这么做的原因是康涅狄格州的律师朋友告诉他们这样做。当我们说我们要投资的时候，他们决定把这个转变成特拉华C公司。他们利用康涅狄格州的律师来做这件事。这太棒了。然而，后来，当该公司筹集巨额资金时，三位创始律师发现康涅狄格州的律师们做错了转变。他们在硅谷雇佣了一家新的律师事务所。因此，它是无效的。他们犯了一个非常简单的错误，但结果是无效的。他们不得不搁置创始阶段，在筹集资金之前必须解决这个问题。

It took them  six months, it involved four different law firms and it cost them half a million  dollars. The moral of the story is use valid lawyers if you're going to do  this. Start with a Delaware C corp. Another option that's really great, especially for young  start-ups when they're forming is Clerky. Clerky is a YC company and they have a  platform that allows you to create all of this formation documents using a very simple  interface, where you just plug in a bunch of details and all the forms get  populated with those information, so everything's internally consistent. They allow everything to be e-signed on  their platform and then they store it all for you. This is a really great  option if you're just going with the basics. You just want to get it done.  It costs a few hundred dollars. Again, plus filing fees.

他们花了六个月的时间，涉及了四家不同的律师事务所，花费了50万美元。这个故事的寓意是，如果你要这么做，就请有效的律师。从特拉华C公司开始。另一个非常好的选择，特别是对于年轻的创业公司来说，当他们正在组建的时候，这是一个很好的选择。办事员是一家YC公司，他们有一个平台，允许你使用一个非常简单的界面创建所有的格式文档，你只需插入大量的细节，所有的表单都会被这些信息填充，所以一切都是内部一致的。他们允许所有的东西都在他们的平台上进行电子签名，然后他们为你储存所有的东西。这是一个非常好的选择，如果你只是与基础。你只想把它做完。它要几百美元。再加上备案费。

It's a much more straight  forward process. When we have companies who come to us at YC who we agreed  to fund who haven't been incorporated yet, that's where we send them. We tell them  to go and incorporate on Clerky. Okay. Part of the incorporation process then is assigning  equity. This is a really important process, because one of the things that happens is  it actually creates a conversation between the founders.

这是一个更直截了当的过程。当我们有公司来到我们的YC，我们同意提供资金，但尚未成立，这是我们的地方，他们。我们告诉他们去和职员合并。好的。因此，公司成立过程的一部分是分配股权。这是一个非常重要的过程，因为发生的事情之一是它实际上在创始人之间创造了一种对话。

It's really important that you do have  that discussion amongst the founders to understand how this is going to work. This can  often out issues early around ... There's one founder expecting to work on this part-time,  there's one founder expecting to work on this full-time.

非常重要的是，你必须在创始人之间进行讨论，以了解这将是如何运作的。这常常会提前解决问题.。有一位创始人希望在这个兼职上工作，有一位创始人希望在这个全职上工作。

It can just try and pull  out some issues that might potentially become big problems down the road. Of course, the  shares that you own in the company as a founder, if a company is successful,  it's likely to be the most significant source of wealth creation for you.

它可以试着抽出一些问题，这些问题可能会成为未来的大问题。当然，作为公司的创始人，你所持有的股份，如果一家公司是成功的，它很可能是你创造财富的最重要的来源。

It's important  that you do actually get this right and let all founders feel it's fair. Fairness  is a really important idea here, because you're gong to be working with the co-founders  for a long time. You're going to be working in a very stressful environment and  if you have an example, a situation where this co-founder who has 90% of shares  and another founder who has 10% pf the shares, but they're both pouring everything they  have into this company to make it a success. Resentment can build up.

重要的是，你一定要把这件事做好，让所有的创始人都觉得这是公平的。公平是一个非常重要的想法，因为你要和联合创始人一起工作很长一段时间。你将在一个压力很大的环境中工作，如果你有一个例子，这位共同创始人拥有90%的股份，另一位创始人拥有10%的股份，但他们都在倾注他们所有的一切来使公司取得成功。怨恨会累积起来。

In a  stressful situation the resentment can bubble up and become worse and worse.

在压力很大的情况下，怨恨会冒出来，变得越来越糟。

It's the number  one reason we find co-founders break up, because they just can't get to the point  where this makes sense to them anymore. Actually in a lot of these situations as  well, when a co-founder disputes happens around this, so much effort and time is poured  into it that actually the company struggles to survive.

这是我们发现联合创始人分手的首要原因，因为他们无法达到对他们来说有意义的地步。事实上，在很多这样的情况下，当联合创始人围绕这件事发生争执时，大量的努力和时间被投入到其中，以至于公司实际上难以生存。

It struggles to turn itself around,  after the founders have figured this out, one of them is departed, and it's all  being somewhat acrimonious. Have those conversations up front make sure you understand, make sure everybody  feels it's fair.

当创建者们想明白这一点后，他们中的一个已经离开了，这一切都有点尖刻。把这些对话摆在前面，确保你能理解，确保每个人都觉得这是公平的。

In general, we think that equity should be more or less split  evenly, amongst co-founders.

总的来说，我们认为股权应该在共同创始人之间大致平均分配。

I'm talking about more or less, it doesn't have to be exact.  But often founders will push back on this. Some of the examples that they, or  some of the reasons that they will give to us for saying, "No, I should  have 70% of the equity and my co-founder should have 30% of the equity.

我说的差不多，不一定要准确。但创始人往往会回击这一点。他们举了一些例子，或者他们会给我们一些理由说：“不，我应该拥有70%的股权，而我的联合创始人应该拥有30%的股权。

It's  because I thought of the idea." Or "I built the prototype." Or "I closed the  first 20K in sales." Or "I started three months before my co-founder." Our response to  this is everything is ahead of you. This is the early days of the company  and if you've worked on it for three months, you've probably got five, 10, 15  years of this company ahead of you, if it's going to be a success. Think  about forwards, not backwards. All the effort is in front of you. You're going to  be iterating on the product, the prototype is probably going to bear no resemblance to  the final product that becomes successful.

这是因为我想到了这个主意。“或者“我建造了原型”或者“我结束了第一个20K的销售。”或者“我比我的联合创始人早了三个月”我们对此的反应是，一切都在你面前。这是公司的早期，如果你已经在公司工作了三个月，你可能会有5年，10年，15年的时间，如果你想要成功的话。想想向前，而不是向后。所有的努力都在你面前。你要对产品进行迭代，原型可能与最终成功的产品毫无相似之处。

It's all ahead of you. The time commitment, again,  it's 10 years, 15 years.

一切都在你眼前。时间承诺，再一次，是10年，15年。

It's a long time. Three months is just a drop  in the ocean. The only one that may be is somewhat more of an argument  to have slightly more, I'm not talking about significantly more, is you might want to  have one co-founder who has slightly more shares, just to prevent founder dead lock in  situations. To be honest, if you're at a point, where the founders are having to  vote their shares to make decisions, then there's probably something more fundamentally broken in the  relationship, that this is not going to solve that.

已经很长时间了。三个月只是沧海一粟。唯一可能更多的论点是稍微多一点，我不是在说更多，而是你可能希望有一个联合创始人，他拥有更多的股份，只是为了防止创始人在情况下死死锁住了。老实说，如果你到了一个阶段，创始人必须投票才能做出决定，那么这段关系中可能会有一些更根本的破坏，这并不能解决这个问题。

In conclusion, when you're thinking about  allocating equity, think about everything that's ahead of you, not everything that you've just done.  You discussed it, you all decide it's fair. You've all got more or less even  stocks splits. You do actually have to do some paperwork to make this actually happen.  Again, this is a kind of thing that can cause problems. Again, another company that  we invested in came to us already incorporated, they already had all of their shares  and everything else all set up. But for various reasons, they actually had to incorporate  a new company and merge the old company into the new company. They basically swapped  their shares in the new company for shares in the old company. Carried on, did  well, raised some money. Then raised another round of money with again, new lawyers. New  lawyers always go through all the paperwork for the fine tooth comb. The new lawyers  discovered that actually in the original company they had never papered their share purchases. They  didn't actually legally own the shares, which meant that then when they swapped them for  the new shares in the new company, that in turn the new shares in the  new company, because they hadn't actually done a two way transaction. They had given one  thing in return for something else. Everything they've done since as shareholders were invalid. They  didn't have part of the company. Again, cue, lots of lawyers, lots of time, lots  of money.

总之，当你考虑分配股权时，想想你面前的一切，而不是你刚刚做的每一件事。你们讨论过了，你们都认为这是公平的。大家或多或少都有股票分拆。你确实需要做一些文书工作才能真正实现这一点。再说一次，这是一种会引起问题的东西。再一次，我们投资的另一家公司已经成立了，他们已经拥有了他们所有的股份，其他的一切都已经建立起来了。但由于种种原因，他们实际上不得不成立一家新公司，并将旧公司合并为新公司。他们基本上把新公司的股份换成了旧公司的股份。继续，做得很好，筹到了一些钱。然后又和新的律师们一起筹集了新一轮的钱。新来的律师总是把所有的文件都看完。新的律师发现，实际上在原来的公司，他们从来没有掩饰自己的股票购买。他们实际上并没有合法持有这些股票，这意味着当他们把新公司的新股换成新公司的新股时，这反过来又是新公司的新股，因为他们并没有进行双向交易。他们用一件东西换了别的东西。他们作为股东所做的一切都是无效的。他们没有公司的一部分。再一次，提示，很多律师，很多时间，很多钱。

It's just not what needs to be focused on by the company. The  way that you buy shares as founders is on a stock purchase agreements. As I  say, you exchange it usually for cash.

但这并不是公司需要关注的问题。你作为创始人购买股票的方式是在股票购买协议上。就像我说的，你通常把它换成现金。

In the case of formation, you usually pay  a few dollars to buy your shares. The money gets deposited from your individual bank  account into the company bank account. Sometimes it's in return for IP, but that gets  a little bit more complex. Once you bought your shares, you have ownership of the  company. This is how you record the ownership. You use a cap table. This is  a really basic cap table.

在组建的情况下，你通常花几美元买你的股票。这些钱会从你的个人银行账户存入公司的银行账户。有时它是以IP作为回报，但这会变得更加复杂。一旦你买了你的股票，你就拥有了公司的所有权。这就是你记录所有权的方式。你用帽子桌。这是一张非常基本的帽子桌。

It will get more complex as the company goes on.  You'll issue shares to employees. You'll issue shares to investors. Basically, the key points of  this are that you are recording how many shares each of the people on the  cap table own.

随着公司的发展，情况会变得更加复杂。你会向员工发行股票。你会向投资者发行股票。基本上，这其中的关键点是，你记录了每个人在表上拥有多少份股份。

In this case, currently the founders. What their ownership is.

在这种情况下，目前的创始人。他们的所有权是什么。

In this  example we have three founders. They each have the same number of shares. They each  have the same ownership of the company. We'll come back to this cap table, because  we're going to build on it as we go through here. One of the key  parts of the stock purchase agreement that you will sign as founders, is that there  are actually some restrictions on these shares. You own them as of the day you  buy them. But actually if a founder was going to leave, then a company has  the right to take some of those shares back over time. As time progresses, the  number of shares that the company has the right to repurchase reduced. That's called vesting.  The opposite way around, vesting is earning the right to permanent ownership of the shares  over time. Here, for start-ups again, it makes sense to use the standard template, the  standard process. Generally, that is four year vesting with a one year cliff. What that  means is if you look at this graph over here, we've got time along the  bottom and we've got the percentage of your shares that are vested on the Y  axis. The cliff happens at one year. Between day one and day 365 all of  your shares are subject to the repurchase option. Then on day 365 25% of them  are immediately released. That's where the cliff comes in. After that, each month of the  year, 1/48 of your shares will vest. They are gradually being released. By the end  of the four years, 100% of the shares are vested. Basically, depending on where you  are on the time period of this, if you were to leave the company, you  would able to calculate how many shares you would keep as a founder, and how  many shares would be repurchased by the company. The documents are written in such a  way that the shares that get repurchased by the company are purchased at the price  that was originally paid for them. There's no gain or anything built into that. The  reason why we have vesting is ... There's actually a number of different reasons. The  first one is because it provides protection to any remaining founders.

在这个例子中，我们有三个创始人。他们各有相同的股份。他们对公司拥有相同的所有权。我们会回到这张盖帽桌，因为我们要在它的基础上通过这里。你将作为创始人签署的股票购买协议的关键部分之一是，实际上对这些股票有一些限制。在你买的那一天你就拥有了它们。但实际上，如果一位创始人打算离开，那么一家公司有权在一段时间内收回其中的一些股份。随着时间的推移，公司有权回购的股份数量减少。这就是所谓的归属。反过来，归属是赚取永久所有权的股份随着时间的推移。在这里，对于初创企业来说，使用标准模板(标准流程)是有意义的.一般情况下，这是四年与一个一年的悬崖归属。这意味着，如果你看这里的图表，我们有时间在底部，我们得到你的股票的百分比，在Y轴上。悬崖发生在一年。在第一天到第365天之间，您的所有股票都将接受回购期权。然后在第一天365，25%的人被立即释放。那就是悬崖进来的地方。在那之后，一年中的每一个月，你的1/48的股票将归属。他们正逐渐被释放。到四年结束时，100%的股份都归给了。基本上，取决于你在这段时间里所处的位置，如果你要离开公司，你就可以计算出你作为创立者会持有多少股份，以及公司会回购多少股。文件的书写方式使公司回购的股份按最初支付的价格购买。这里面没有任何好处或任何东西。我们之所以有归属是因为.。其实有很多不同的原因。第一个原因是，它为任何剩余的创始人提供了保护。

If you think of  an example, where you're working on a company with three ... There's three of you  in total. You and two co-founders. Let's assume that one of your co-founders, and you  don't have vesting, let's assume one of your co-founders leaves in six months, but the  remaining two founders carry on working on this company, put a huge amount of effort  in, build up a successful company over the next five to 10 years. Meanwhile, the  ex founder is sitting on a beach, drinking cocktails, doing all these things that people  have time to do. How do you feel? You are not going to feel massively  happy that this person has the same amounts of value and you're creating all this  value for them. Then think about, if your company gets acquired. Let's say your company  is acquired for 500 million dollars. Without vesting, that ex co-founder will get the same  amounts of money as the two remaining founders. Which again, is not going to make  you feel that great. Protect for the most situations.

如果你想到一个例子，你在一家有三家公司的公司工作.你们一共有三个人。你和两个联合创始人。让我们假设你的联合创始人之一，而你没有归属，让我们假设你的联合创始人之一在六个月后离开，但剩下的两位创始人继续在这家公司工作，付出巨大的努力，在未来的五到十年内建立一家成功的公司。与此同时，这位前创始人正坐在海滩上，喝着鸡尾酒，做着人们有时间做的所有事情。你感觉怎么样呢？你不会为这个人拥有同样数量的价值而感到巨大的快乐，而你正在为他们创造所有这些价值。然后想想，如果你的公司被收购。假设你的公司是以5亿美元收购的。如果没有归属，这位前联合创始人将获得与其余两位创始人相同的资金。这也不会让你感觉那么好。保护大多数情况。

If they're happy investing and that  founder had left after six months, then they would have no shares in there and  the remaining founders who put in all the effort of the next five to 10  years would've seen all the value creation. Somewhat linked to that is the concept of  having skin in the game. This creates an incentive to actually work hard on a  company, because you need to be there for a long time to actually keep all  your shares. This is something again, that investors care deeply about. Because they don't want  in a bunch of money into a company, when really they're investing in the founders,  because they're the people who are going to actually make this happen. The founders turn  around after a month and say, "We're out. We're going to get some new people  in to run the company." It protects the investors as well. Finally, the final reason  is that it sets an example to future employees. As we'll see in a little  while, you would expect the employees to have vesting.

如果他们乐于投资，而这位创始人在六个月后就离开了，那么他们就没有股票了，剩下的那些在未来5到10年里投入全部精力的创始人就会看到所有的价值创造。与此相关的是游戏中有皮肤的概念。这就产生了一种激励你在一家公司努力工作的动机，因为你需要在那里呆很长一段时间才能真正保留你所有的股份。这也是投资者非常关心的问题。因为他们不想把一大笔钱投入一家公司，当他们真正地投资于创始人的时候，因为他们才是真正实现这一目标的人。创建者们在一个月后转过身来，说：“我们出去了，我们要找一些新的人来管理公司。”它也保护投资者。最后，最后的原因是它为未来的员工树立了榜样。我们一会儿就会看到，你会希望员工们得到归属。

It's very fair to say to  your employees, "You must have vesting, but I don't as a founder." It's just a  good way to be ... We all have the same situation here. Okay. Final point  of vesting and this is an important one when you come around to do your  paperwork. There is one piece of paper as part of the incorporation process called an  83B election. Basically I'm not going to go into huge amount of details. Basically if  you don't sign it, then you're taxed on the increase in value of your shares  every time your shares vest.

这是非常公平地对你的员工说，“你一定有权利，但我不是作为一个创始人。”这只是一个很好的方式.。我们在这里的情况都是一样的。好的。最后一点的归属，这是一个重要的问题，当你来做你的文书工作。作为组建过程的一部分，有一张纸叫做83B选举。基本上，我不会说太多的细节。基本上，如果你不签字的话，那么每次你的股票归属时，你的股票价值的增长都会被征税。

If you think about that graph, after the first year  and then every month over the next three years. This can create huge personal tax  liabilities.

如果你想一想这个图表，在第一年之后，在接下来的三年里，每个月。这会造成巨大的个人税负。

It also creates company tax liabilities. This is a bad thing. The way to  solve this is to file your 83B election. Basically then, you don't have this taxation  over the vesting period.

它还产生了公司的税收责任。这是件坏事。解决这一问题的方法是提交你的83B选举。基本上，在转归期内，你并没有这项税项。

It's the one thing in incorporation that cannot be fixed, if  you don't do it. You have to file it with the IRS within 30 days  and it's best to retain proof of mailing. So that you can actually show that  you did that.

如果你不去做的话，这是一件不能解决的事情。你必须在30天内将其提交国税局，最好保留邮寄证明。这样你就能证明你做到了。

If you get down the line in an acquisition or when you're  doing a funding round, it will get asked for. That proof will get asked for  that you signed it. We have seen deals fall apart over this. Both funding rounds  and acquisition deals, because the investor or the acquirer has been spooked by the potential  liabilities on the company. They just don't want to go there. They walk away from  the deal. The way to solve this is follow the instructions. Either when you're dealing  with lawyers or when you're dealing with Clerky, they will give you instructions about how  to complete the form. The will give you instruction about where to send it, how  to do it. Just follow those instructions and all will be fine. All right. Let's  move on to fundraising. You've now got a company that can actually raise some money.  This is probably something that you'll hear a lot about over the course of the  rest of this course.

如果你在一次收购中走到了这一步，或者你正在进行一轮融资，它就会被要求。那份证明会被要求证明是你签的。我们看到交易因此而分崩离析。无论是融资回合还是收购交易，都是因为投资者或收购方被公司的潜在负债吓到了。他们只是不想去那里。他们放弃了交易。解决这一问题的方法是遵循说明。无论是与律师打交道，还是与办事员打交道，他们都会给你如何填写表格的指导。它会给你指示如何发送它，如何发送它。只要遵照这些指示，一切都会好起来的。好的我们继续筹款吧。你现在有了一家公司，它实际上可以筹集到一些资金。这可能是您在本课程的其余课程中会听到的很多内容。

I'm not going to talk here about the strategy around pricing  or valuation or how you talk to investors.

我不会在这里谈论有关定价或估值的策略，也不会谈论你如何与投资者交谈。

I'm talking more about the nuts and  bolts that happen behind the scenes.

我说的是幕后的细节。

In very simple terms, you can either raise money  on a priced round, or you can raise money on a non-priced round, which are  always known as convertible rounds.

用非常简单的术语来说，你可以通过一个定价的回合来筹集资金，或者你可以通过一个非定价的回合来筹集资金，这就是所谓的可转换轮。

In a priced round, the shares are sold for specific  price at the time of that round.

在一轮定价中，股票在那一轮的时候以特定的价格出售。

In an unpriced or convertible round, they investor  gives money now, but the shares are given in the future. The ordering for this,  usually in the US, usually in the valley is that start-ups will first raise money  on a unpriced round, they'll raise a little bit of money. And then a couple  of years later, they'll hopefully raise money on a priced round. The rest of the  world hasn't quite caught up to this idea of unpriced rounds. Generally, we see when  companies are coming to us from around the world, they actually raise money immediately on  priced rounds. Let's go through an example of a priced round. You can see how  this works. As I say, the valuation of the round sets the price that the  investor will pay to buy a share. Let's work through this with an example. Let's  assume we have the same company as before. Our founders have nine million shares and  they've done really well. They're going to raise two million dollars at an eight million  dollar valuation.

在未定价或可兑换的一轮中，投资者现在就给钱，但股票是未来的。对此，通常在美国，通常是在山谷的订单是，初创企业将首先筹集资金在一个未定价的轮，他们将筹集一点钱。几年后，他们有望通过定价来筹集资金。世界上的其他国家还没有完全赶上这种“无价格轮”的想法。一般来说，我们看到当公司从世界各地来找我们的时候，他们会立即在定价轮上筹集资金。让我们来看看一个标价圆的例子。你可以看到这是怎么回事。正如我所说，这一轮的估值决定了投资者购买股票的价格。让我们用一个例子来解决这个问题。假设我们有和以前一样的公司。我们的创始人拥有900万股票，他们做得很好。他们将以800万美元的估值筹集200万美元。

I say eight million dollar valuation is pre-money, is the terminology. That basically  means before the investor puts any money in, the valuation of the company is eight  million. The way that you calculate the price for the shares that the investor will  buy, is you just divide the eight million valuation by the pre-money shares, so the  nine million shares. Which gives a price of 89 cents. Then they will be able  to buy 2.25 million shares for that two million dollars. The post-money valuation at this  point is 10 million dollars, because it was the eight million dollar valuation before the  investor put money in. Now there's two million dollars sitting in the bank account as  well.

我说八百万美元的估值是预钱，是术语.这基本上意味着，在投资者投入资金之前，该公司的估值为800万英镑。你计算投资者将要购买的股票的价格的方法是，你只需将八百万股估值除以货币前的股票，那么九百万股。价格是89美分。然后，他们将能够购买225万股，以这200万美元。目前的估值为1000万美元，因为这是投资者投入资金前的800万美元估值。现在银行账户里也有两百万美元。

It's increased the value of the company up by two million. The post money  is 10 million. You'll hear those terminologies just to get them straight in your mind.  Now this is what the cap table looks like. We still have our three founders.  They still own three million shares each. We've known created a new class of shares  which have been sold to the investor. Now the investor owns 20% of the company.  Each of the founders have been reduced from 33% of the company to 26$ of  the company. This makes it all sound very simple. Actually it's not. There's various other  complexities in here that I'm not going to talk about. There's a lot of documents  that are involved in here with a lot of things that need to be negotiated.  If company is doing a priced round, then you would need to use a lawyer,  you'd need to hire a lawyer to help you with all of that. They'll be  able to talk you through the whole process. Moving on to the unpriced rounds and  for most companies who raise money now here at Bay area is they will use  an instrument called a SAFE, which stands for Simple Agreement For Future Equity. The simple  is really important, because it actually is simple.

它使公司的价值增加了两百万。邮费是一千万。你会听到那些术语只是为了让它们直接进入你的脑海。这就是帽桌的样子。我们还有三位创始人。他们仍然各持有300万股票。我们知道，我们创造了一个新的类别的股票，已经出售给了投资者。现在，投资者拥有该公司20%的股份。每一位创始人都从公司的33%降到了26美元。这一切听起来都很简单。其实不是。这里还有各种各样的复杂问题，我不打算谈。这里有很多需要协商的文件。如果公司正在做一个定价轮，那么你需要聘请一名律师，你需要聘请一名律师来帮助你这一切。他们就能跟你谈完整个过程了。接下来是未定价的几轮融资，对于现在湾区筹集资金的大多数公司来说，他们将使用一种名为“保险箱”的工具，这代表着未来股权的简单协议。简单是很重要的，因为它实际上很简单。

It's only a few pages long, so  it's easy to understand. We also have these documents on the Y Combinator website and  really great primer that explains a lot more about them. You can look at that  for some more details. Basically what it's saying is the investor is giving the company  money now, in return for the right to receive shares in a future round. The  investor is giving money now. They don't want to receive shares in the future round  at the price of the future round. Because when they invest now, they're probably investing  it in a much riskier stage.

它只有几页长，所以很容易理解。我们也有这些文件在Y组合网站和真正伟大的入门解释了更多关于他们。你可以看看这个来了解更多的细节。基本上，它的意思是投资者现在给公司钱，以换取在未来一轮中获得股票的权利。投资者现在正在给钱。他们不想以未来一轮的价格在未来一轮中获得股票。因为当他们现在投资的时候，他们可能会把它投资在一个风险更高的阶段。

It's a much earlier start-up. They want some kind  of bonus or deal to reflect that. The way that that's built in is the  SAFE includes what's called a valuation cap. What this cap does is it sets a  valuation up abound for the calculation of working out a price for the shares. Again,  as an example, we'll use our same company. Nine million shares for the founders, but  this time in April of this year they raise 400,000 dollars on SAFEs with a  four million dollar cap. Then, fast forward some time, we're going to the future. December  2017, they'd raise a two million dollar round as an eight million pre money valuation.  This time there's actually two calculations that needs to happen. Because there's the SAFE conversion  price, and there's the priced round price. You can see here, the SAFE conversion price  uses the four million dollar cap, as the valuation, whereas the round price uses the  eight million dollar valuation. Even though, all these shares are being actually given at the  same time. As a result, the SAFE holder here has a price for share of  half of series A investors, the priced round investors. That means that actually for their  money, because they came in early, they're getting twice as many shares as somebody who  was putting in the same amount of money in the priced round. That's how they  get their bonus in all of this. Again, the cap table, but the time we  get to the December priced round, the cap table looks like this. Now we always  have the SAFE investor on there, on the cap table. They own the same shares,  the same class of shares. Yes, question.

这是一个更早的启动。他们想要某种形式的奖金或交易来反映这一点。内置的方式是保险箱，包括所谓的估值上限。这个上限所做的是，它为计算股票的价格提供了大量的估值。同样，作为一个例子，我们将使用我们的同一家公司。创始人拥有900万股票，但今年4月，他们在保险柜上筹集了40万美元，上限为400万美元。然后，快进一段时间，我们就会走向未来。2017年12月，他们将筹集200万美元，作为800万美元的会前估值。这一次需要进行两次计算。因为有安全的转换价格，还有价格的圆周价。你可以在这里看到，安全转换价格使用400万美元的上限作为估值，而圆价格使用800万美元的估值。尽管如此，所有这些股票实际上都是同时发行的。其结果是，这里的安全持有者对A类投资者的一半股份有了一个价格，那就是定价较高的圆投资者。这意味着，实际上他们的钱，因为他们来得早，他们得到的股票是一个人的两倍，谁投入了同样数额的钱，在定价的一轮。他们就是这样得到奖金的。再说一遍，帽子桌，但当我们到12月的价格轮，帽子桌看起来像这样。现在，我们总是有安全的投资者在那里，在帽桌上。他们拥有相同的股份，同样的股份。是的，问题。

Audience: Does the discount on the SAFE only kick in if the money raised is below  the cap?
Kristy Nathoo: Most SAFEs are on a cap. There's a separate kind of SAFE that has a  discount. Are you asking, does the cap kick in if the valuation of the round  is lower than the cap?
Audience: Both of those aren't applied in the same SAFE usually?
Kristy Nathoo: Generally not. Generally you wouldn't have cap under the discount, because that's cherry picking for  the investor. You would try very hard to avoid that situation.

观众：当筹到的钱低于上限时，保险箱的折扣才会生效吗？克里斯蒂·纳苏：大多数保险柜都戴着帽子。有一种单独的保险箱有折扣。你是在问，如果这一轮的估值低于上限，那么这个上限会不会生效？观众：通常情况下，这两种方法都不适用于同一个保险箱？克丽丝蒂·纳苏：一般不会。一般来说，你不会有低于折扣的上限，因为这是投资者的选择。你会尽力避免这种情况的。

In the situation where  you had a four million dollar cap, but your round was at three million dollars,  for instance, everybody would just convert to the three million dollar round. Okay. Again, we  have the founders are now earning less of a company, because they've sold of the  company to their investors.

当你有一个四百万美元的上限，而你的一轮是三百万美元的时候，每个人都会转换成三百万美元的一轮。好的。再说一遍，我们的创始人现在的公司收入减少了，因为他们已经把公司卖给了他们的投资者。

Audience: Could you talk a little bit about why SAFErs prefer sometimes for the priced round?
Kristy Nathoo: Yeah. The benefits of a SAFE over priced round is that's a lot simpler. You  can just sign one SAFE, immediately and get the money.

观众：你能谈谈为什么保险柜有时更喜欢定价轮吗？克里斯蒂·纳苏：是的。一个安全的价格过高的圆周率的好处是，这是一个简单得多。你只要签一个保险箱，马上拿到钱。

It doesn't require lawyers.

不需要律师。

I'll  come into a few more details, but basically it's simple. That's the important thing. Let's  talk about dilution and we'll talk a little bit more about that. The idea is  is that at the early stage of your company, if you think about your company  as a pie, where the size of the pie is the value of the company.  In the early days, you have a massive slice of a very small pie. Then  as the company grows, the size of the pie grows, but your slice becomes smaller,  because you're giving away or you're selling parts of the company. But the important thing  here is that actually your wealth in all of this is the area of your  pie, the area of your slice rather. The thing to bear in mind is that  dilution is inevitable.

我会再讲几个细节，但基本上很简单。这才是最重要的。让我们来谈谈稀释问题，然后再多谈一些。我们的想法是，在公司的早期阶段，如果你把你的公司看作一个馅饼，那么饼的大小就是公司的价值。在早期，你有一大块非常小的馅饼。然后，随着公司的发展，馅饼的大小也会增加，但你的份量会变小，因为你是在送礼，或者是在出售公司的部分业务。但重要的是，实际上，你的财富是你的饼的面积，而不是你的那一片。要记住的是，稀释是不可避免的。

It's going to happen, but the important thing is is that you're  still creating wealth for yourself and for your investors, because that's how they make money  as well.

这是会发生的，但重要的是，你仍然在为自己和投资者创造财富，因为他们也是这样赚钱的。

It's just very important to actually consider dilution as you're going through. One  thing that we see founders make mistake early on is that they sell too much  of the company early on, to bear a low valuation. Really in the early days  of the company, you're still trying to figure out what product you're building. You're still  trying to figure out what you're going to do. What do you need to spend  the money on? Mostly money when you spend money when you raise is on hiring.  But if you're at that stage, you probably don't want to hire. Why raise more  money than you need, if you can wait six months or a year and raise  it to higher valuation? Just something to bear in mind as a way to not  sell too much of the company in the early days.

这是非常重要的是，真正考虑稀释，因为你正在经历。我们看到，创始人很早就犯了一个错误，那就是他们很早就卖掉了公司太多的股份，无法承受较低的估值。实际上，在公司成立初期，你还在努力弄清楚你在生产什么样的产品。你还在努力弄清楚你要做什么。你要把钱花在什么上？当你筹集到钱的时候，大部分钱都花在招聘上。但如果你在那个阶段，你可能不想雇佣。如果你可以等待六个月或一年，并将其提高到更高的估值水平，那为什么要筹集比你需要的更多的资金呢？只是要记住一些东西，这样才能在早期不把公司的股份卖得太多。

In terms of the logistics,  as I was saying, price round is complex and SAFE is simple. Again, with SAFEs  you can use Clerky. They have a fundraising product as well. They have the standard  YC templates built into their system. You can just plug in the investor details, plug  in the amount of money, send it off to your investor to be signed. They  get the bank wire details as well, so they can send the money to the  company. Which is also an important point. You do actually want the money back from  the investors.

就物流而言，正如我刚才所说，轮价是复杂的，安全是简单的。再说一遍，有保险箱你可以用文员。他们也有筹款产品。他们的系统中有标准的YC模板。你只需插入投资者的详细信息，插入金额，发送给你的投资者签署。他们也能得到银行的电汇信息，这样他们就可以把钱寄给公司了。这也是很重要的一点。你确实想从投资者那里拿回钱。

It's very easy to say, "Oh yeah, we've got investors in. That's great."  Our first question is have you got money in the bank? The founders say, "Oh  no, because" some excuse. You've got to keep working on your investors until the money  is in the bank. The other that's slightly, just a minor point here is that  because you're selling equity in the company, the company will need to complete a board  consent for part of this, even with the SAFE. That's a legal document with a  specific form.

很容易说，“哦，是的，我们有投资者，那太好了。”我们的第一个问题是你银行里有钱吗？创始人说，“哦，不，因为”一些借口。你必须继续为你的投资者工作，直到钱在银行里为止。另一个小问题是，由于你在出售公司的股权，公司需要获得董事会的部分同意，即使是在外管局的情况下也是如此。这是一份带有特定形式的法律文件。

It's not enough just for the founders to email it each other and  say, "We're doing this right." Again, Clerky will help you with that. Or if you're  using lawyers to do any of this, they'll help you with this as well.

仅仅是创始人发电子邮件说，“我们做得对”是不够的。再一次，办事员会帮你的。或者如果你用律师来做这件事，他们也会帮你的。

It's  just something to bear in mind. All right. Now, you've raised some money. What are  you going to do with that money? Probably you're going to spend most of that  money on hiring. Again, hiring is a complex area.

这只是需要记住的事情。好的现在，你已经筹到了一些钱。你打算拿那笔钱做什么？可能你会把大部分钱花在招聘上。再一次，招聘是一个复杂的领域。

It's governed by lots of laws  and regulations.

它受许多法律法规的制约。

I'm not a specialist. Don't suspect you as founders to be specialists. The  important thing is that you understand the basics and that you understand that there are  people out there who can help you with all of this. Okay. The first part  if this is deciding if you're going to hire somebody. What role they're going to  be? In the US, again, you can somebody either as a contractor or as an  employee. They have slightly different characteristics and slightly different results in terms of how you  pay them.

我不是专家。不要怀疑你是创建者是专家。最重要的是你理解了基本知识，你也明白有很多人可以帮助你完成这一切。好的。第一部分，如果这是决定你是否要雇用某人。他们将扮演什么角色？再一次，在美国，你可以是承包商，也可以是雇员。他们有稍微不同的特点和略有不同的结果在你如何支付他们。

In both cases, a contractor and an employee will assign the IP that  they create to the company. A contractor will sign a consulting agreement, an employee will  sign an IP assignment agreement. But then for the contractor, there's some requirements for them.  Generally, they set their own work hours, they work on a specific project with an  end goal that's very defined. They use their own equipment. They're not really involved in  any day to day running of the company. An example of this would be you  hire a designer to design your website.

在这两种情况下，承包商和雇员都会将他们创建的IP分配给公司。承包商将签署咨询协议，员工将签署IP转让协议。但对承包商来说，他们有一些要求。一般来说，他们设定自己的工作时间，他们在一个特定的项目上工作，最终目标是非常明确的。他们使用自己的设备。他们并没有真正参与公司的日常运营。这方面的一个例子是你雇用了一个设计师来设计你的网站。

It's a month long project, and they deliver  you a website and you say, "Great. This is just what we need." Off they  go to their next project. On the other hand employees will attempt to use company  equipment, so the company generally will provide them with a laptop. They will usually be  working company hours, and in the company location. Of course, with start-ups that gets a  little bit gray. There's more supervision. They have less autonomy over their decisions about how  they actually build or how they do their work. And importantly, for the US for  an employee to work in the US, they need to have work authorization. Whereas a  contractor, you could hire to work remotely and they wouldn't' need work authorization. For contractors,  if you decide that you are hiring a contractor, then you would agree on a  contract how you would actually pay them. Usually, that's either time or milestone based. Milestone  based would be, in our example of a web designer, maybe you proved 25% of  the fees upfront and you provide the other 75% of the fees when the designed  provides the final design for the website.

这是一个月的项目，他们给你一个网站，你说，“太好了，这正是我们所需要的。”他们去做下一个项目。另一方面，员工会尝试使用公司的设备，所以公司通常会为他们提供笔记本电脑。他们通常是在公司工作时间，并在公司的位置。当然，初创公司会变得有点灰暗。有更多的监督。他们对自己如何实际构建或如何完成工作的决定没有多少自主权。更重要的是，对于在美国工作的员工来说，他们需要获得工作授权。而承包商，你可以雇用远程工作，他们将不需要工作授权。对于承包商来说，如果你决定雇用一个承包商，那么你就会同意一份合同，你将如何实际支付他们。通常，这要么是基于时间的，要么是基于里程碑的。里程碑将是，在我们的一个网页设计师的例子，也许你证明了25%的费用前期和你提供的其他75%的费用，当设计提供最终设计的网站。

It's really straight forward for the company to  pay them, because they don't have to worry about any taxes being withheld, or anything  else like that. You just pay the contractor. At the end of the year, the  company will create a form that's called a form 1099, which you send to the  contractor, so that they can include the income in their personal tax returns. Also, the  company sends one to the IRS. Obviously that's the US regulation, so if you have  a company that's not in the US, then you wouldn't need to file a 1099.  Generally, if you're working with the contractor who's not in the US, you wouldn't need  to file a 1099 either, but things get a little bit more complex there. Take  advice. On the flip side, paying employees is more complex for the company. The company  pays their employees but they have to withhold ... The company withholds tax on employees  behalf and pays it over to various agencies, so IRS to state agencies and sometimes  to city agencies as well. There's a lot of calculations in there, it gets very  complex very fast.

对公司来说，支付这些税款是非常直接的，因为他们不需要担心任何预扣的税收，或者诸如此类的事情。你只要付钱给承包商就行了。在年底，公司将创建一个名为1099的表单，你把它发送给承包商，这样他们就可以将收入包括在他们的个人纳税申报表中。此外，该公司还向国税局发送了一份。显然，这是美国的规定，所以如果你有一家不在美国的公司，那么你就不需要提交1099。一般来说，如果你和不在美国的承包商一起工作，你也不需要提交1099，但事情会变得更复杂一些。听听建议。另一方面，给员工付工资对公司来说更为复杂。公司付给员工工资，但他们不得不扣留.该公司代为雇员缴税，并支付给各机构，因此国税局向州机构，有时也向城市机构。里面有很多计算，很快就会变得非常复杂。

If you have employees all over in different states, it's more of  a headache for the company. But the IRS prefer it because they get their tax  every time the employee gets paid. What happens at the end of the year is  the company provides a form W-2 to each of the employees. Then the employee uses  that to show how much tax has already been withheld on their behalf and how  much income they have. This is a situation where you should absolutely not be the  person calculating all of this. You should use a payroll service provider.

如果你在不同的州都有员工，那对公司来说就更让人头疼了。但国税局更喜欢这样做，因为他们每次拿到工资都要交税。年底发生的事情是，公司向每位员工提供一份W-2表格。然后，雇员用它来显示已经为他们扣缴了多少税款，以及他们有多少收入。在这种情况下，你绝对不应该是计算这一切的人。您应该使用薪资服务提供商。

It's totally worth  the money, it's not very expensive. They basically take all of this hassle away from  you. The company that a lot of YC start-ups use, who is a YC company  themselves is Gusto. They just deal with all of this for you.

这是完全值得的钱，它不是很贵。他们基本上把所有的麻烦都从你身上拿走了。很多YC初创公司使用的公司，谁是YC公司本身就是古斯托。他们只是为你处理这一切。

It just makes  life a lot easier. The other thing to bear in mind is that under California  law in particular, but other laws as well, employees are required to be paid minimum  wage. You can't have somebody working for you for free and expecting them to be  producing work for the company. Do just bear in mind that when you are hiring  people, you do need to pay them. The other part of a start-up employees compensation  package is made up of equity. Usually, this is again, the part that is the  way that they possibly create more wealth for themselves.

这只会让生活更轻松。另外要记住的是，特别是根据加州的法律，但其他法律也要求雇员获得最低工资。你不可能有一个人免费为你工作，并期望他们为公司工作。请记住，当你雇用员工时，你确实需要给他们报酬。新成立的雇员补偿计划的另一部分是由股权构成的.通常，这也是他们为自己创造更多财富的方式。

It's really important that start-up founders  do give their employees equity, because it helps to incentivize everybody to work towards the  same thing, which is creating a successful company. Often in the early days, for employees,  they are being paid below market rate. Still above minimum wage, but below market rate.  Giving them stock in the company is a way to compensate them for that reduction  in cash that they're potentially seeing.

真正重要的是，初创公司的创始人应该给予员工权益，因为这有助于激励每个人朝着同样的目标努力，这就是创建一家成功的公司。通常在早期，对雇员来说，他们的工资低于市场利率。仍然高于最低工资，但低于市场利率。给他们在公司的股票是补偿他们的现金减少，他们可能看到。

It increases their upside.

这增加了他们的优势。

It's really important that you  are generous with shares. Particularly in the early days, because the people who are going  to be employee number one, two, three are going to be with you for a  long time. They're going to be working really hard in the same way that the  founders are. They're going to be setting how the company goes forward. They're going to  be doing a lot of stuff.

非常重要的是，你要慷慨地持有股票。尤其是在早期，因为第一、第二、第三位的员工将会和你在一起很长一段时间。他们会像创始人一样努力工作。他们将决定公司的发展方向。他们会做很多事情。

It's important that they are motivated in the same  way. There's a rule of thumb, you can think about giving maybe 10% of the  company to the first 10 employees, but obviously on a sliding scale. Employee one gets  more than employee two, who gets more than employee three, etc. The reason why it's  not that much of a gamble to be generous, is that all of these will  have vesting. All of these employees will have vesting on their shares.

重要的是，他们有同样的动机。这是一条经验法则，你可以考虑把公司10%的股份给前10名员工，但很明显，这是一个滑动的比例。第一雇员比第二雇员得到更多，而第三雇员得到更多，等等。慷慨并不是一场赌博，因为所有这些都是有意义的。所有这些雇员都将继承他们的股份。

If something doesn't  actually work out and you have to fire the employee, which when you are hiring  people, generally start-ups make a lot of mistakes and they have to fire a lot  of people. You're not going to be too burnt by that, because the vesting means  that the company has the right to repurchase their shares. The way that companies usually  structure this, they create a stock plan, which is again another bunch of legal documents  which need to be signed and kept. They, again, can be done on Clerky or  you can use a lawyer to do those for you. You can either issue shares  or you can issue options from that stock plan. Usually what you tend to find  is that employees are issued options which means that they have the option to pay  to buy shares in the future. But the price is set now. What this means  that is good for the employees is they don't have to pay cash immediately. They  can actually exercise their options in the future, when the company is looking like a  successful or even in conjunction with an acquisition or something. They don't' even end up  anywhere in an active pocket. There are some tax consequences to that, which is too  much detail to get into now. There's a lot of resources online about options, about  how to issue options, about the pros and cons of them.

如果有些事情没有真正解决，你必须解雇雇员，在你雇用员工的时候，创业公司通常会犯很多错误，他们不得不解雇很多人。你不会因此而太焦虑不安，因为转归意味着公司有权回购他们的股份。按照公司通常的结构，他们制定了一份股票计划，这又是一堆需要签署和保存的法律文件。再一次，他们可以在办事员身上完成，或者你可以请律师为你做这些。您可以发行股票，也可以根据该股票计划发行期权。通常情况下，你会发现员工被授予期权，这意味着他们可以选择在未来购买股票。但价格现在定了。这意味着对员工有利的是，他们不必立即支付现金。当公司看起来是成功的，甚至是与收购或其他事情结合在一起的时候，他们实际上可以在未来行使他们的选择。他们甚至不会在一个活跃的口袋里的任何地方结束。这有一些税收后果，这是太多的细节，现在无法进入。网上有很多关于期权的资源，关于如何发放期权，关于期权的利弊。

If you're interested, there's  lots out there. Finally, the other thing on this is it's really important to communicate  to your employees what they're getting in terms of equity. First of all, you need  to be clear to yourself what they're getting. Which means that you need to understand  the number of shares they're getting and what that represents in terms of percentage of  the company. Because if you only give them one and not the other, it gets  very confusing. Because you can say, "You have X percent of the company." But what  does that mean? X percent of what? Whereas, if you say, "You have a 100,000  shares." Well, what does that mean? Is that a lot of the company or is  that a small amount of the company? Clear in your head and then be clear  with the employee about what's going on. All right. Final topic is just a couple  of reminders about things that you have to do to be a legitimate company.

如果你有兴趣的话，外面有很多。最后，这件事上的另一件事是，向你的员工传达他们在公平方面得到的信息是非常重要的。首先，你需要弄清楚他们得到了什么。这意味着你需要了解他们得到的股份数量，以及他们在公司中所占的比例是多少。因为如果你只给他们一个，而不是另一个，这会让他们很困惑。因为你可以说，“你拥有公司的X%的股份。”但这意味着什么？什么的X%？然而，如果你说，“你有10万股。”那是什么意思？那是公司的很多钱还是公司的一小部分？头脑清醒，然后跟员工说清楚到底发生了什么。好的最后的主题只是一些提醒，你必须做的事情，才能成为一个合法的公司。

It's  important that you keep all of these documents that we're talking about in a safe  place. You're going to need them at stressful times. You're going to need them during  acquisitions. You're going to need them during fundraising due diligence. You're going to need them  so many times, that if you don't have them all stored, in signed format, it's  just going to make your life really hard. Keep all your documents in a safe  place. Just assign one of the co-founders to be responsible for this. You should make  sure you know your key metrics in the company, which again is going to be  covered in a lot more detail throughout the course. But it's the kind of thing  that, again, you just want to have off the top of your head immediately. Also,  you should make sure that the money that you're spending, that the investors have given  to you is being spent sensibly. Spend money on things that will increase the chances  of the company being a success. These investors have trusted you with their money to  try to multiply their money. They haven't given you their money to go off to  Vegas, which happened to one of our companies a few years ago, where one of  the founders took quite a lot of company money, went to Vegas, had a great  time, according to Facebook and the founders and investors found out, and that founder got  fired. Actually he could have faced criminal charges as well. They decided not to press  charges. Just bear in mind, that this is the company's money and what it should  be used for. Okay.

重要的是你要把我们谈论的所有这些文件都保存在一个安全的地方。在压力大的时候你会需要他们的。在收购过程中你会需要它们。在募款时你会需要他们的尽职调查。你会有很多次需要它们，如果你不把它们都储存起来，以签名的格式，那只会让你的生活变得很艰难。把你所有的文件放在一个安全的地方。只要指派一位联合创始人负责这件事就行了。您应该确保您知道您在公司的关键指标，这将在整个课程中涵盖更多的细节。但这是一种东西，再次，你只是想要从你的头顶立即。另外，你应该确保你所花的钱，投资者给你的钱是明智的。把钱花在那些能增加公司成功机会的事情上。这些投资者相信你，用他们的钱来增加他们的钱。他们没有给你钱去拉斯维加斯，几年前我们的一家公司发生了这件事，其中一位创始人拿了很多公司的钱，去了拉斯维加斯，玩得很开心，据Facebook的创始人和投资者发现，那个创始人被解雇了。实际上他也可能面临刑事指控。他们决定不起诉。记住，这是公司的钱，也是用来做什么的。好的。

In conclusion, that was a really fast run through of some  of the basics. Don't expect you to be experts in any of this. Don't expect  you to have all of this figured out.

总之，这是一个非常快的过程中的一些基础。别指望你是这方面的专家。别指望你把这一切都弄清楚了。

It's just important that you know that  there are some things that you need to do. These items up here are the  really key take aways for this to just bear in mind as you go forward  with your companies. Okay.

重要的是你要知道有一些事情你需要去做。这些项目是真正的关键好的。

I think we have couple of minutes for questions, if there  are any.

如果有问题的话，我想我们还有几分钟的时间。

Audience: For the employee shares, what's generous for the first five employees? You said the word  generous.

观众：对于员工来说，对于前五名员工来说，什么是慷慨的？你说了慷慨这个词。

Kristy Nathoo: It depends, because it depends on the kind of hires that you're giving.

Kristy Nathoo：这取决于，因为这取决于你给的是什么样的员工。

If your  first hire is going to be a software engineer, that's going to be very different  if your first hire is a community manager. For the first 10 is usually somewhere  around 10%, maybe for the first five you want to be somewhere around seven to  eight mark.

如果你的第一份工作是软件工程师，那么如果你的第一份工作是社区经理的话，那就完全不同了。对于前10位，通常是在10%左右，也许在前5位，你想要在7到8位左右的位置。

It really varies and part of this is you have to think ahead.  You don't want to be giving employee number one 30% of the company, and employee  number two 20% of the company, because you're going to run out of company to  give them.

它真的是不同的，其中的一部分是你必须提前思考。你不想给公司30%的员工，给公司20%的员工，因为你会用光公司给他们。

It's part of planning ahead for your hiring needs.

这是为你的招聘需求预先计划的一部分。

Audience: How much transparency should there be inside the company of the cap table? How should  that change as you grow ?
Kristy Nathoo: In the early days, when it's just the founders, there should be a 100% transparency.  Everybody should know everything. Generally, as the company grows, it becomes slightly less. You wouldn't  show a line by line cap table to your employees, for instance. But obviously there's  transparency of saying, "You have this number of shares and the total number of shares  is this" is going to give them the information that they need. Because they really  only care about themselves. They don't care ... Actually, that's not true, is it? That's  true that they care about themselves, they don't care ... They shouldn't care about what  the person next to them getting. You wouldn't share that information.

观众：帽子桌的内部应该有多大的透明度？随着你的成长，这种情况应该如何改变？KristyNathoo：在早期，当仅仅是创始人的时候，应该有100%的透明度。每个人都应该知道一切。一般来说，随着公司的发展，它会变得更少。例如，您不会向员工显示逐行上限表。但是很明显，说“你有这个数量的股票，而股票的总数是这个”的话是透明的，它会给他们提供他们所需要的信息。因为他们真的只关心自己。他们不在乎.。实际上，那不是真的，对吧？这是真的，他们关心自己，他们不在乎.他们不应该关心身边的人得到了什么。你不会分享这些信息的。

Audience: For organizations that may have a faster path to profitability and a longer path to  exit, is it still best practice to give out equity, instead of doing things like  profit sharing?
Kristy Nathoo: If you're looking at a start-up, the general start-up idea of growth and most of  the value is created by equity.

听众：对于那些可能有更快的盈利能力和更长的退出路径的组织来说，还是最好的做法是分配股权，而不是像利润分享这样的事情？Kristy Nathoo：如果你看的是一家初创企业，一般的创业理念是增长，而大部分的价值都是由股权创造的。

It's a good idea to generally compensate people through  equity.

通过公平来补偿人们是个好主意。

If you're looking at more of something that's more of a lifestyle business, which  can be a great business for two or three founders who don't take outside money  and create a business that's very profitable from the start, then yes. Maybe doing some  kind of profit share or some kind of very generous bonus scheme or something like  that is a better answer. Usually that's not the case for start-ups. Usually, they're not  profitable for a long time.

如果你在寻找更多关于生活方式的业务，这对两到三位创始人来说可能是一项伟大的业务，他们从一开始就不接受外部资金，创造一项非常有利可图的业务，那么是的。也许做一些利润分享或某种非常慷慨的奖金计划或类似的事情是一个更好的答案。通常，创业公司的情况并非如此。通常，他们在很长一段时间内都不会盈利。

Audience: How do these different things differ if you have more of a non for profit  or social good face company that's main necessarily becoming the biggest ?
Kristy Nathoo: Non profits are very different. Because there isn't this idea of owning shares and things,  so that's a whole different idea. There's also rules around how much you can pay  employees in non profits. On a social good companies, it depends on what sort of  a company it is. Again, you need to decide in a way of what your  mentality.

观众：如果你拥有更多的非营利公司或社会公益公司，那么这些不同的东西有什么不同呢？Kristy Nathoo：非营利组织是非常不同的。因为没有拥有股票和东西的想法，所以这是一个完全不同的想法。在非营利组织中，你可以向员工支付多少工资，这也是有规则的。对于一个社会好的公司，这取决于它是什么样的公司。再一次，你需要以一种方式来决定你的心态。

Is your mentality still to be like a start-up even though you're going to  do some something that gives back. You can still have a start-up mentality in that.  You'd probably still want to go down that path of having equity and having that  conversation in that way. You can still fundraise as well as a social good kind  of company.

即使你要做一些回馈的事情，你的心态仍然像个创业家。你仍然可以有一种创业的心态。你可能仍然希望走上公平的道路，并以这种方式进行对话。你仍然可以筹集资金，也可以是一家社会公益公司。

It's a little bit harder, but you can still do it.

虽然有点难，但你还是可以做到的。

Audience: Let's say you granted those 10% to your first 10 employees and you are going  through another round of funding. Do you dilute only co-founders or also those first employees?
Kristy Nathoo: No. Generally ... This gets a little bit complex, but the simple answer is that  subsequent round of fundraising will dilute all existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holding,  it's a little bit more complex than that, but that's the general-  Yeah. You need to make that employees will know that you might be giving them  shares now that represent one percent of the company. But by the time they get  to an exit, it might represent 0.01 percent of the company. But in that respect,  they probably been given more later on and this idea of the pie being much  bigger. Even one percent of the company that's worth zero is still worth much less  than 0.1 percent of a company that's worth a 100 million dollars.

观众：假设你把这10%给了你的前10名员工，而你正在经历另一轮的融资。你是只稀释联合创始人，还是稀释那些第一批员工？克丽丝蒂·纳苏：不。一般来说.。这有点复杂，但简单的答案是，接下来的一轮融资将稀释所有现有股东持有的股份比例，这比这要复杂一些，但这是一般的-是的。你需要让员工知道，现在你可能会给他们代表公司1%的股份。但是当他们离开的时候，它可能代表了公司的0.01%。但在这方面，他们可能会在更晚的时候得到更多的东西，而这个馅饼更大的想法。即使是价值为零的公司的百分之一的价值仍然远远低于价值一亿美元的公司的百分之零点一。

Audience: Just differences between preferred shares and the common shares?
Kristy Nathoo: The investors get preferred shares and as the title suggests, they have some preferences.

观众：只是优先股和普通股的区别？KristyNathoo：投资者获得优先股，正如标题所示，他们有一些偏好。

I'm  not a lawyer, I'm a finance person.

我不是律师，我是金融家。

I can do this in a very top  level explanation. Basically they have a bunch of rights that common holders don't have. They  have things like liquidation preferences, which means that when the company exists, they're first in  line to get their proceeds to get the amount of money that they invested back,  before anybody else does. For example, if investors invested two million dollars into a company  and then it got sold, but the cash was ... Sorry, they invested two million  dollars into a company and they own 20%. But the cash that came out of  an exit further down the road was only two million dollars. They would see all  their money, before any of the common holders i.e. The founders would see their. That's  one. There's various other different protections that they have in there. That's probably the key  one, that's the financial basis. But then there's voting rights, there's right to refusal. There's  lots of different things, that's why it's a much more complex negotiation, because you have  to negotiate all of these rights within there.

我可以在最高级的解释中做到这一点。基本上，他们有很多共同持有者没有的权利。他们有清算偏好之类的东西，这意味着当公司存在的时候，他们会首先得到他们的收益，在其他人之前得到他们投资的资金。例如，如果投资者向一家公司投资200万美元，然后它就被出售了，但现金是.对不起，他们向一家公司投资了200万美元，他们拥有20%的股份。但从更远的出口流出的现金只有200万美元。他们会看到他们所有的钱，在任何一个共同的持有者，即创始人看到他们的。那是一个。他们还有其他不同的保护措施。这可能是关键，那是财政基础。但也有投票权，有拒绝的权利。有很多不同的东西，这就是为什么这是一个更复杂的谈判，因为你必须谈判所有这些权利在那里。

Audience: Is there any specific company that you see it's really successful on the , you  don't have to say the company, but do you think there's a specific motto that  you think worked really well for company .

观众：有没有你看到的公司真的很成功，你不需要说公司，但你是否认为有一个具体的座右铭，你认为对公司很好。

Kristy Nathoo: That's a great question.

Kristy Nathoo：这是一个很好的问题。

I think the companies that do this well are the ones  that are transparent. The ones that sit down with their employees and really talk through  what these things mean and what options are and how vesting works? Here's a scenario  where some companies will have ...

我认为做得好的公司是透明的。那些和他们的员工坐下来，真正谈论这些事情意味着什么，有什么选择，以及归属是如何运作的人呢？这是一些公司会有.

If a company exits for this much money, what  does this mean to you? Whereas, if a company exits for this much money, how  will you see. They've done all of these calculations and they really make sure that  employees understand.

如果一家公司为了这么多钱退出，这对你意味着什么？然而，如果一家公司为了这么多钱而离开，你会怎么看。他们做了所有这些计算，他们真的确保员工理解。

I think that's a really good practice to have. What that needs first  is the founder's need to understand this, which is actually surprisingly not common. Often I  have a lot of conversations with founders where they don't understand this stuff. They can't  even explain it to their own employees. Understanding it yourself and being very clear with  employees is definitely ... And being organized as well.

我觉得这是个很好的练习。首先需要的是创始人理解这一点的需要，这其实并不常见。我经常和创始人交谈，他们不了解这些东西。他们甚至无法向自己的员工解释。你自己明白，对员工很清楚，这绝对是.也很有条理。

Audience: 10% to the first 10 employees-
Kristy Nathoo: This is all just a rule of thumb.

观众：10%给前10名员工-克里斯蒂·纳托：这都是一条经验法则。

Audience: Sure.

观众：当然。

Kristy Nathoo: Everyone's fixating on this
Audience: My next question, the next rule of thumb is, after dilution, roughly how much of  the company do you think on average those first employees would end up owning at  an acquisition?
Kristy Nathoo: It really varies, because it depends when in the lifecycle of the company it gets  acquired.

Kristy Nathoo：每个人都盯着这个观众：我的下一个问题，下一个经验法则是，在稀释之后，你认为公司的第一批员工平均在收购时会拥有多少股份？KristyNathoo：它真的是不同的，因为它取决于在公司的生命周期中它被收购的时间。

It depends how many fundraising rounds there's been.

这取决于有多少次筹款活动。

It depends how many more employees  have been after them. There's a lot of different variables there. The first money that  company's raised will be the most dilutive.

这取决于还有多少员工在跟踪他们。有很多不同的变量。该公司筹集的第一笔资金将是最具稀释性的。

If an employee comes in and there's already  been three rounds of money, then they're probably not going to be diluted as much,  as if there were the first employee and they have to go through all of  that dilution.

如果一名员工进来，已经有了三轮资金，那么他们可能不会被稀释得那么多，就像第一位员工一样，他们必须经历所有的稀释。

It's hard to give a number.

很难给出数字。

Audience: Could you throw some light on how shares in Facebook were diluted?
Kristy Nathoo: No.

观众：你能说明一下Facebook的股票是如何被稀释的吗？克丽丝蒂·纳苏：不。

I don't know any of the details. Sorry.

我不知道任何细节。抱歉的

Audience: Do safe notes usually convert to preferred shares or to common equity?
Kristy Nathoo: SAFEs, not safe notes. They convert usually into preferred shares, because again the investors want  all of the rights and privileges that come with those preferred shares. There are some  circumstances where they might convert into a combination of preferred and common, but that's less  usual.

观众：安全票据通常转换为优先股还是普通股？Kristy Nathoo：保险箱，不是保险箱。他们通常转换为优先股，因为再次，投资者想要所有的权利和特权，与这些优先股。在某些情况下，它们可能会转换为首选和常见的组合，但这并不常见。

Audience: Have you seen any different types of vesting schedules for companies that are on a  longer term timeline, where the cliff might be longer than a year and a total  time might be more than four years?
Kristy Nathoo: I sometimes see companies push it out to five years. Also, sometimes companies don't have  the cliff at all. They just do monthly vesting over the period. But that is  a harder sell for the five year. The longer the time line, it's the harder  sell for the employees. You've got to be mindful of that. On the flip side,  what usually happens is if you've had an employee who's been with you for four  years, then they've been fairly diluted, because there's going to be funding round, there's going  to be subsequent employees. You would actually give them a new stock rounds on top  of the one they already have, which would then have new vesting from the date  that you granted it for them. Then they'll have another four year period there. That's  how you get through the long time period. Okay, last question.

观众：你有没有见过对处于较长期时间表的公司的任何不同类型的转归时间表，其中悬崖可能超过一年，总时间可能超过四年？KristyNathoo：我有时看到公司把它推到五年。而且，有时公司根本就没有悬崖。他们只是在这段时间内每月交割。但在这五年里，这是一个很难卖出的买卖。时间越长，员工的销售就越难。你得记住这一点。另一方面，通常的情况是，如果你有一个已经跟你在一起四年的员工，那么他们就会被相当的稀释，因为会有资金支持，也会有后续的员工。实际上，你会在他们已经拥有的股票的基础上给他们一轮新的股票，然后从你批准给他们的日期开始进行新的归属。那他们在那里还有四年的时间。这就是你度过这段长时间的方法。好的，最后一个问题。

Audience: Have you seen any situations where somebody can trade a common share for a preferred  share or the other way around? Is that common?
Kristy Nathoo: There wouldn't really be a case where you would trade common shares for preferred shares.  There is a mechanic in the fundraising, in the priced round documents that allows preferred  shares to be converted into common in various different circumstances. That's usually around exits and  calculation of proceeds and things like that. Are you trying to get at founder's preferred  shares?  Okay. All right.

观众：你有没有见过有人可以用普通股换优先股，或者换股换普通股的情况？这很普遍吗？KristyNathoo：你不会真的用普通股换优先股。在融资中有一个技师，在定价的圆周性文件中，允许优先股在各种不同的情况下转换为共同的股票。这通常是关于出口和收益的计算之类的。你想得到创始人的优先股吗？好的。好的

I think we ran out of time. Thank you very much for  listening, everyone. Enjoy the rest of the course.


我想我们没时间了。非常感谢大家的倾听。好好享受剩下的课程。
