# Startup Mechanics - Kirsty Nathoo

Steven: Before we start, I wanted to introduce our speaker today. Kristy Nathoo is the CFO  and a partner at Y Combinator. She has basically worked virtually with every company that  has gone through YC. From incorporations to fundraising to hiring to exists. Kristy's pretty much  seen it all. Today she'll talk to you about start-up mechanics.
Kristy Nathoo: Thank you. Hi everyone. Thanks for coming in to listen to this. As Steven said,  this lecture is about start-up mechanics, which is going to cover some of the basic  issues that most start-ups will face as they go through the early days of becoming  a real company. I'm really only talking about the basics here. There's a lot of  complexity and there's a lot of other things that happen. But this will give you  some ideas of the things you should know about and some of the resources out  there that there is to help you with those. I know that we are standing  here in California at the moment, but a lot of this stuff will apply to  any start-ups, no matter where they are in the world. I'll talk a little bit  throughout the session about the things that are US specific and things that are specific  to the rest of the world. This is definitely not the glamorous part of being  a start-up founder. You'll hear from all sorts of people throughout the rest of this  course about all the glamorous things and all the other things. These are nuts and  bolts that, if you take of in the early days, you stick with the simple  stranded basic processes, you don't try to reinvent new voting structures or anything like that,  it will be enough. On the flip side, if you don't do some of these  basics, then the company down the road will come into some problems that will cost  a lot of time, effort and money to get solved. I'll bring up a few  stories as we go through of situations where that's happened. These are the topics that  we're going to cover today. We're going to go through the lifecycle of a company.  Again, start in the early days of forming, going through raising some money, hiring some  people, giving out shares. The first step in this is the formation of the company.  Formation creates a separate legal entity. What that means is the entity that will pay  its own taxes, be responsible for its own assets, for its own liabilities, sign its  own contracts, sue and be sued. It's all independent of the owners, so you as  a founder would be independent of the company. In the US this kind of company  is called a C corp, a corporation. There are other structures that are out there  for entities to form, but in the case of start-ups, who are expecting to be  successful and to grow and to raise money and to eventually IPO, then a C  corp is the way to go. Investors can only really invest in C corps. There's  a lot of other things that come in if you decide to go down some  other route. You may hear some advice from people who aren't necessarily in the start-up  world to start with a LLC or something like that, which might work in the  short term, but then as you become more successful, more in need of raising money,  you will have to convert to a C corp. It probably make sense, if you  are thinking about doing a start-up in that situation to start with the C corp.  Terminology gets a little bit loose here and I'm as guilty as everyone. But through  the whole of this session, when we're generally talking about this, basically the words company,  C corp, corporation, entity, start-up, all mean the same thing. They all mean this separate  legal entity that is a C corp. The hardest part in formation though, is deciding  actually when to incorporate this company. Because obviously with the separate legal entity comes a  lot of admin and various other processes that have to happen around that. It's one  of those situation where you don't want to do it too soon, but you also  don't want to do it too late. Too soon would probably be, if you're still  throwing around ideas, you're still thinking about this as a side project, you're not sure  if you're going to be doing this for a long time, you don't know if  you're going to be working with the co-founders. All of those I would suggest that  you don't incorporate at this point. However, the flip side of that is, if you're  at the stage where you are creating significant demands of IP that you want to  make sure it's clearly owned, particularly if there's more than one of you creating the  IP, then that would be a situation where you would want to incorporate. Another situation  is if you've built a product that you're now ready to start charging for, so  you can create a separate entity that takes the money in for the products that  you're charging, you want the separate bank account, you want a company bank account and  a personal account, you don't want to intermingle those dollars. Actually Stripe has a product  called Stripe Atlas, which basically helps founders to form a company to the point where  they can get a bank account to make them start accepting payments through Stripe. The  other reason why you would want to incorporate is just to protect you as individuals.  Because again, as I was saying, a separate entity means that all of the liabilities  and anything else that happens there, would be on a company rather than you as  an individual. If you get into the situation where that might come important, again, it's  a good idea to incorporate. All right, at YC we strongly believe that the US  is the best place to incorporate a company, regardless of where the founders come from  or where they are when they're actually incorporating. The reason for this is that the  vast majority of the capital that's available to start-ups is here in the US. Generally,  US investors struggle to invest in non-US companies. There are some exceptions and it is  possible, but generally it causes problems. When you are going through the process of incorporation,  you don't actually have to be physically in the US whilst you are incorporating. Then  in the US you can incorporate your company in any of the 50 states. You  don't have to, again, be physically located in that state. You don't have to be  planning to do any business in that state. Actually, for start-ups and for a lot  of companies actually, the state that most start-ups will incorporate in is Delaware. The reason  being is that Delaware lawyers highly developed, pretty much all lawyers who are working on  corporate law in the US know Delaware law. Investors expect to see Delaware companies, Delaware  law allows companies the most flexibility in terms of issuing shares and various other things.  Also has the best privacy protections for you as owners. It makes a lot of  sense to incorporate in Delaware, because again, this is one of this situations where there's  not point in trying to do something different. Just go with the head on this.  Again, you can incorporate in Delaware as non-US citizens, you can incorporate in Delaware when  you are not physically in the US. There's no problems there. All right, let's move  on to actually how we incorporate. It's a two step process. The first part is  simply faxing a couple of forms into Delaware to say, "I would like to create  an entity." It takes about 24 hours for them to process and to get the  entity formed. Once that entity is being formed, then the second step in the process  is to adopt by laws for the company, which talk about how the company is  going to be governed. Create a board, appoint directors to that board, appoint offices, to  assign IP to the company, so you as individuals then anything you start creating is  owned by the company. Also to give out shares in the company, so to assign  ownership in the company. The final couple of those, so assigning IP and buying shares.  I'm going to talk about a little bit more detailed. The other three are very  legal and complex. I won't go into those here. Suffice is to say that there  is a couple of different options that you can use to do this. The first  one is to just use a lawyer. A lot of companies will just hire a  lawyer to do this. That's a great option, especially if you want to do something  a little bit non standard in some way or you need some kind of high  touch service there. It usually costs in the region of three to five thousand dollars  plus filing fees to incorporate a company with a lawyer. There's loads of lawyers here  in the valley and most of those for start-ups will actually deffer their fees until  you raise money. Often those fees can be pushed back and you don't have to  pay those immediately. However, what doesn't work with lawyers is if you have a friend  or a cousin who lives in Alabama and is a real estate property lawyer and  having them doing the incorporation documents, because they didn't understand how start-ups work, they don't  understand what the standard things are that start-up documents include. Things could go wrong. An  example os this is we had a company that came to us in YC that  we founded and they came to us as LLC formed in Connecticut. The reason why  they've done that is because the founder's friends who were lawyers in Connecticut told them  to do that. When we said we were going to invest they decided that they  were going to convert this, at that point, to a Delaware C corp. They used  their Connecticut lawyers to do this. Which is great. However, three founding rounders later when  the company was raising huge amounts of money, a new law firm that they'd hired  here in the valley actually discovered that that conversion had been done wrong by the  Connecticut lawyers. Therefore, it was not valid. They'd made a very simple mistake, but as  a result it wasn't valid. They had to put the founding round on hold and  they had to sort this out before they could raise the money. It took them  six months, it involved four different law firms and it cost them half a million  dollars. The moral of the story is use valid lawyers if you're going to do  this. Start with a Delaware C corp. Another option that's really great, especially for young  start-ups when they're forming is Clerky. Clerky is a YC company and they have a  platform that allows you to create all of this formation documents using a very simple  interface, where you just plug in a bunch of details and all the forms get  populated with those information, so everything's internally consistent. They allow everything to be e-signed on  their platform and then they store it all for you. This is a really great  option if you're just going with the basics. You just want to get it done.  It costs a few hundred dollars. Again, plus filing fees. It's a much more straight  forward process. When we have companies who come to us at YC who we agreed  to fund who haven't been incorporated yet, that's where we send them. We tell them  to go and incorporate on Clerky. Okay. Part of the incorporation process then is assigning  equity. This is a really important process, because one of the things that happens is  it actually creates a conversation between the founders. It's really important that you do have  that discussion amongst the founders to understand how this is going to work. This can  often out issues early around ... There's one founder expecting to work on this part-time,  there's one founder expecting to work on this full-time. It can just try and pull  out some issues that might potentially become big problems down the road. Of course, the  shares that you own in the company as a founder, if a company is successful,  it's likely to be the most significant source of wealth creation for you. It's important  that you do actually get this right and let all founders feel it's fair. Fairness  is a really important idea here, because you're gong to be working with the co-founders  for a long time. You're going to be working in a very stressful environment and  if you have an example, a situation where this co-founder who has 90% of shares  and another founder who has 10% pf the shares, but they're both pouring everything they  have into this company to make it a success. Resentment can build up. In a  stressful situation the resentment can bubble up and become worse and worse. It's the number  one reason we find co-founders break up, because they just can't get to the point  where this makes sense to them anymore. Actually in a lot of these situations as  well, when a co-founder disputes happens around this, so much effort and time is poured  into it that actually the company struggles to survive. It struggles to turn itself around,  after the founders have figured this out, one of them is departed, and it's all  being somewhat acrimonious. Have those conversations up front make sure you understand, make sure everybody  feels it's fair. In general, we think that equity should be more or less split  evenly, amongst co-founders. I'm talking about more or less, it doesn't have to be exact.  But often founders will push back on this. Some of the examples that they, or  some of the reasons that they will give to us for saying, "No, I should  have 70% of the equity and my co-founder should have 30% of the equity. It's  because I thought of the idea." Or "I built the prototype." Or "I closed the  first 20K in sales." Or "I started three months before my co-founder." Our response to  this is everything is ahead of you. This is the early days of the company  and if you've worked on it for three months, you've probably got five, 10, 15  years of this company ahead of you, if it's going to be a success. Think  about forwards, not backwards. All the effort is in front of you. You're going to  be iterating on the product, the prototype is probably going to bear no resemblance to  the final product that becomes successful. It's all ahead of you. The time commitment, again,  it's 10 years, 15 years. It's a long time. Three months is just a drop  in the ocean. The only one that may be is somewhat more of an argument  to have slightly more, I'm not talking about significantly more, is you might want to  have one co-founder who has slightly more shares, just to prevent founder dead lock in  situations. To be honest, if you're at a point, where the founders are having to  vote their shares to make decisions, then there's probably something more fundamentally broken in the  relationship, that this is not going to solve that. In conclusion, when you're thinking about  allocating equity, think about everything that's ahead of you, not everything that you've just done.  You discussed it, you all decide it's fair. You've all got more or less even  stocks splits. You do actually have to do some paperwork to make this actually happen.  Again, this is a kind of thing that can cause problems. Again, another company that  we invested in came to us already incorporated, they already had all of their shares  and everything else all set up. But for various reasons, they actually had to incorporate  a new company and merge the old company into the new company. They basically swapped  their shares in the new company for shares in the old company. Carried on, did  well, raised some money. Then raised another round of money with again, new lawyers. New  lawyers always go through all the paperwork for the fine tooth comb. The new lawyers  discovered that actually in the original company they had never papered their share purchases. They  didn't actually legally own the shares, which meant that then when they swapped them for  the new shares in the new company, that in turn the new shares in the  new company, because they hadn't actually done a two way transaction. They had given one  thing in return for something else. Everything they've done since as shareholders were invalid. They  didn't have part of the company. Again, cue, lots of lawyers, lots of time, lots  of money. It's just not what needs to be focused on by the company. The  way that you buy shares as founders is on a stock purchase agreements. As I  say, you exchange it usually for cash. In the case of formation, you usually pay  a few dollars to buy your shares. The money gets deposited from your individual bank  account into the company bank account. Sometimes it's in return for IP, but that gets  a little bit more complex. Once you bought your shares, you have ownership of the  company. This is how you record the ownership. You use a cap table. This is  a really basic cap table. It will get more complex as the company goes on.  You'll issue shares to employees. You'll issue shares to investors. Basically, the key points of  this are that you are recording how many shares each of the people on the  cap table own. In this case, currently the founders. What their ownership is. In this  example we have three founders. They each have the same number of shares. They each  have the same ownership of the company. We'll come back to this cap table, because  we're going to build on it as we go through here. One of the key  parts of the stock purchase agreement that you will sign as founders, is that there  are actually some restrictions on these shares. You own them as of the day you  buy them. But actually if a founder was going to leave, then a company has  the right to take some of those shares back over time. As time progresses, the  number of shares that the company has the right to repurchase reduced. That's called vesting.  The opposite way around, vesting is earning the right to permanent ownership of the shares  over time. Here, for start-ups again, it makes sense to use the standard template, the  standard process. Generally, that is four year vesting with a one year cliff. What that  means is if you look at this graph over here, we've got time along the  bottom and we've got the percentage of your shares that are vested on the Y  axis. The cliff happens at one year. Between day one and day 365 all of  your shares are subject to the repurchase option. Then on day 365 25% of them  are immediately released. That's where the cliff comes in. After that, each month of the  year, 1/48 of your shares will vest. They are gradually being released. By the end  of the four years, 100% of the shares are vested. Basically, depending on where you  are on the time period of this, if you were to leave the company, you  would able to calculate how many shares you would keep as a founder, and how  many shares would be repurchased by the company. The documents are written in such a  way that the shares that get repurchased by the company are purchased at the price  that was originally paid for them. There's no gain or anything built into that. The  reason why we have vesting is ... There's actually a number of different reasons. The  first one is because it provides protection to any remaining founders. If you think of  an example, where you're working on a company with three ... There's three of you  in total. You and two co-founders. Let's assume that one of your co-founders, and you  don't have vesting, let's assume one of your co-founders leaves in six months, but the  remaining two founders carry on working on this company, put a huge amount of effort  in, build up a successful company over the next five to 10 years. Meanwhile, the  ex founder is sitting on a beach, drinking cocktails, doing all these things that people  have time to do. How do you feel? You are not going to feel massively  happy that this person has the same amounts of value and you're creating all this  value for them. Then think about, if your company gets acquired. Let's say your company  is acquired for 500 million dollars. Without vesting, that ex co-founder will get the same  amounts of money as the two remaining founders. Which again, is not going to make  you feel that great. Protect for the most situations. If they're happy investing and that  founder had left after six months, then they would have no shares in there and  the remaining founders who put in all the effort of the next five to 10  years would've seen all the value creation. Somewhat linked to that is the concept of  having skin in the game. This creates an incentive to actually work hard on a  company, because you need to be there for a long time to actually keep all  your shares. This is something again, that investors care deeply about. Because they don't want  in a bunch of money into a company, when really they're investing in the founders,  because they're the people who are going to actually make this happen. The founders turn  around after a month and say, "We're out. We're going to get some new people  in to run the company." It protects the investors as well. Finally, the final reason  is that it sets an example to future employees. As we'll see in a little  while, you would expect the employees to have vesting. It's very fair to say to  your employees, "You must have vesting, but I don't as a founder." It's just a  good way to be ... We all have the same situation here. Okay. Final point  of vesting and this is an important one when you come around to do your  paperwork. There is one piece of paper as part of the incorporation process called an  83B election. Basically I'm not going to go into huge amount of details. Basically if  you don't sign it, then you're taxed on the increase in value of your shares  every time your shares vest. If you think about that graph, after the first year  and then every month over the next three years. This can create huge personal tax  liabilities. It also creates company tax liabilities. This is a bad thing. The way to  solve this is to file your 83B election. Basically then, you don't have this taxation  over the vesting period. It's the one thing in incorporation that cannot be fixed, if  you don't do it. You have to file it with the IRS within 30 days  and it's best to retain proof of mailing. So that you can actually show that  you did that. If you get down the line in an acquisition or when you're  doing a funding round, it will get asked for. That proof will get asked for  that you signed it. We have seen deals fall apart over this. Both funding rounds  and acquisition deals, because the investor or the acquirer has been spooked by the potential  liabilities on the company. They just don't want to go there. They walk away from  the deal. The way to solve this is follow the instructions. Either when you're dealing  with lawyers or when you're dealing with Clerky, they will give you instructions about how  to complete the form. The will give you instruction about where to send it, how  to do it. Just follow those instructions and all will be fine. All right. Let's  move on to fundraising. You've now got a company that can actually raise some money.  This is probably something that you'll hear a lot about over the course of the  rest of this course. I'm not going to talk here about the strategy around pricing  or valuation or how you talk to investors. I'm talking more about the nuts and  bolts that happen behind the scenes. In very simple terms, you can either raise money  on a priced round, or you can raise money on a non-priced round, which are  always known as convertible rounds. In a priced round, the shares are sold for specific  price at the time of that round. In an unpriced or convertible round, they investor  gives money now, but the shares are given in the future. The ordering for this,  usually in the US, usually in the valley is that start-ups will first raise money  on a unpriced round, they'll raise a little bit of money. And then a couple  of years later, they'll hopefully raise money on a priced round. The rest of the  world hasn't quite caught up to this idea of unpriced rounds. Generally, we see when  companies are coming to us from around the world, they actually raise money immediately on  priced rounds. Let's go through an example of a priced round. You can see how  this works. As I say, the valuation of the round sets the price that the  investor will pay to buy a share. Let's work through this with an example. Let's  assume we have the same company as before. Our founders have nine million shares and  they've done really well. They're going to raise two million dollars at an eight million  dollar valuation. I say eight million dollar valuation is pre-money, is the terminology. That basically  means before the investor puts any money in, the valuation of the company is eight  million. The way that you calculate the price for the shares that the investor will  buy, is you just divide the eight million valuation by the pre-money shares, so the  nine million shares. Which gives a price of 89 cents. Then they will be able  to buy 2.25 million shares for that two million dollars. The post-money valuation at this  point is 10 million dollars, because it was the eight million dollar valuation before the  investor put money in. Now there's two million dollars sitting in the bank account as  well. It's increased the value of the company up by two million. The post money  is 10 million. You'll hear those terminologies just to get them straight in your mind.  Now this is what the cap table looks like. We still have our three founders.  They still own three million shares each. We've known created a new class of shares  which have been sold to the investor. Now the investor owns 20% of the company.  Each of the founders have been reduced from 33% of the company to 26$ of  the company. This makes it all sound very simple. Actually it's not. There's various other  complexities in here that I'm not going to talk about. There's a lot of documents  that are involved in here with a lot of things that need to be negotiated.  If company is doing a priced round, then you would need to use a lawyer,  you'd need to hire a lawyer to help you with all of that. They'll be  able to talk you through the whole process. Moving on to the unpriced rounds and  for most companies who raise money now here at Bay area is they will use  an instrument called a SAFE, which stands for Simple Agreement For Future Equity. The simple  is really important, because it actually is simple. It's only a few pages long, so  it's easy to understand. We also have these documents on the Y Combinator website and  really great primer that explains a lot more about them. You can look at that  for some more details. Basically what it's saying is the investor is giving the company  money now, in return for the right to receive shares in a future round. The  investor is giving money now. They don't want to receive shares in the future round  at the price of the future round. Because when they invest now, they're probably investing  it in a much riskier stage. It's a much earlier start-up. They want some kind  of bonus or deal to reflect that. The way that that's built in is the  SAFE includes what's called a valuation cap. What this cap does is it sets a  valuation up abound for the calculation of working out a price for the shares. Again,  as an example, we'll use our same company. Nine million shares for the founders, but  this time in April of this year they raise 400,000 dollars on SAFEs with a  four million dollar cap. Then, fast forward some time, we're going to the future. December  2017, they'd raise a two million dollar round as an eight million pre money valuation.  This time there's actually two calculations that needs to happen. Because there's the SAFE conversion  price, and there's the priced round price. You can see here, the SAFE conversion price  uses the four million dollar cap, as the valuation, whereas the round price uses the  eight million dollar valuation. Even though, all these shares are being actually given at the  same time. As a result, the SAFE holder here has a price for share of  half of series A investors, the priced round investors. That means that actually for their  money, because they came in early, they're getting twice as many shares as somebody who  was putting in the same amount of money in the priced round. That's how they  get their bonus in all of this. Again, the cap table, but the time we  get to the December priced round, the cap table looks like this. Now we always  have the SAFE investor on there, on the cap table. They own the same shares,  the same class of shares. Yes, question.
Audience: Does the discount on the SAFE only kick in if the money raised is below  the cap?
Kristy Nathoo: Most SAFEs are on a cap. There's a separate kind of SAFE that has a  discount. Are you asking, does the cap kick in if the valuation of the round  is lower than the cap?
Audience: Both of those aren't applied in the same SAFE usually?
Kristy Nathoo: Generally not. Generally you wouldn't have cap under the discount, because that's cherry picking for  the investor. You would try very hard to avoid that situation. In the situation where  you had a four million dollar cap, but your round was at three million dollars,  for instance, everybody would just convert to the three million dollar round. Okay. Again, we  have the founders are now earning less of a company, because they've sold of the  company to their investors.
Audience: Could you talk a little bit about why SAFErs prefer sometimes for the priced round?
Kristy Nathoo: Yeah. The benefits of a SAFE over priced round is that's a lot simpler. You  can just sign one SAFE, immediately and get the money. It doesn't require lawyers. I'll  come into a few more details, but basically it's simple. That's the important thing. Let's  talk about dilution and we'll talk a little bit more about that. The idea is  is that at the early stage of your company, if you think about your company  as a pie, where the size of the pie is the value of the company.  In the early days, you have a massive slice of a very small pie. Then  as the company grows, the size of the pie grows, but your slice becomes smaller,  because you're giving away or you're selling parts of the company. But the important thing  here is that actually your wealth in all of this is the area of your  pie, the area of your slice rather. The thing to bear in mind is that  dilution is inevitable. It's going to happen, but the important thing is is that you're  still creating wealth for yourself and for your investors, because that's how they make money  as well. It's just very important to actually consider dilution as you're going through. One  thing that we see founders make mistake early on is that they sell too much  of the company early on, to bear a low valuation. Really in the early days  of the company, you're still trying to figure out what product you're building. You're still  trying to figure out what you're going to do. What do you need to spend  the money on? Mostly money when you spend money when you raise is on hiring.  But if you're at that stage, you probably don't want to hire. Why raise more  money than you need, if you can wait six months or a year and raise  it to higher valuation? Just something to bear in mind as a way to not  sell too much of the company in the early days. In terms of the logistics,  as I was saying, price round is complex and SAFE is simple. Again, with SAFEs  you can use Clerky. They have a fundraising product as well. They have the standard  YC templates built into their system. You can just plug in the investor details, plug  in the amount of money, send it off to your investor to be signed. They  get the bank wire details as well, so they can send the money to the  company. Which is also an important point. You do actually want the money back from  the investors. It's very easy to say, "Oh yeah, we've got investors in. That's great."  Our first question is have you got money in the bank? The founders say, "Oh  no, because" some excuse. You've got to keep working on your investors until the money  is in the bank. The other that's slightly, just a minor point here is that  because you're selling equity in the company, the company will need to complete a board  consent for part of this, even with the SAFE. That's a legal document with a  specific form. It's not enough just for the founders to email it each other and  say, "We're doing this right." Again, Clerky will help you with that. Or if you're  using lawyers to do any of this, they'll help you with this as well. It's  just something to bear in mind. All right. Now, you've raised some money. What are  you going to do with that money? Probably you're going to spend most of that  money on hiring. Again, hiring is a complex area. It's governed by lots of laws  and regulations. I'm not a specialist. Don't suspect you as founders to be specialists. The  important thing is that you understand the basics and that you understand that there are  people out there who can help you with all of this. Okay. The first part  if this is deciding if you're going to hire somebody. What role they're going to  be? In the US, again, you can somebody either as a contractor or as an  employee. They have slightly different characteristics and slightly different results in terms of how you  pay them. In both cases, a contractor and an employee will assign the IP that  they create to the company. A contractor will sign a consulting agreement, an employee will  sign an IP assignment agreement. But then for the contractor, there's some requirements for them.  Generally, they set their own work hours, they work on a specific project with an  end goal that's very defined. They use their own equipment. They're not really involved in  any day to day running of the company. An example of this would be you  hire a designer to design your website. It's a month long project, and they deliver  you a website and you say, "Great. This is just what we need." Off they  go to their next project. On the other hand employees will attempt to use company  equipment, so the company generally will provide them with a laptop. They will usually be  working company hours, and in the company location. Of course, with start-ups that gets a  little bit gray. There's more supervision. They have less autonomy over their decisions about how  they actually build or how they do their work. And importantly, for the US for  an employee to work in the US, they need to have work authorization. Whereas a  contractor, you could hire to work remotely and they wouldn't' need work authorization. For contractors,  if you decide that you are hiring a contractor, then you would agree on a  contract how you would actually pay them. Usually, that's either time or milestone based. Milestone  based would be, in our example of a web designer, maybe you proved 25% of  the fees upfront and you provide the other 75% of the fees when the designed  provides the final design for the website. It's really straight forward for the company to  pay them, because they don't have to worry about any taxes being withheld, or anything  else like that. You just pay the contractor. At the end of the year, the  company will create a form that's called a form 1099, which you send to the  contractor, so that they can include the income in their personal tax returns. Also, the  company sends one to the IRS. Obviously that's the US regulation, so if you have  a company that's not in the US, then you wouldn't need to file a 1099.  Generally, if you're working with the contractor who's not in the US, you wouldn't need  to file a 1099 either, but things get a little bit more complex there. Take  advice. On the flip side, paying employees is more complex for the company. The company  pays their employees but they have to withhold ... The company withholds tax on employees  behalf and pays it over to various agencies, so IRS to state agencies and sometimes  to city agencies as well. There's a lot of calculations in there, it gets very  complex very fast. If you have employees all over in different states, it's more of  a headache for the company. But the IRS prefer it because they get their tax  every time the employee gets paid. What happens at the end of the year is  the company provides a form W-2 to each of the employees. Then the employee uses  that to show how much tax has already been withheld on their behalf and how  much income they have. This is a situation where you should absolutely not be the  person calculating all of this. You should use a payroll service provider. It's totally worth  the money, it's not very expensive. They basically take all of this hassle away from  you. The company that a lot of YC start-ups use, who is a YC company  themselves is Gusto. They just deal with all of this for you. It just makes  life a lot easier. The other thing to bear in mind is that under California  law in particular, but other laws as well, employees are required to be paid minimum  wage. You can't have somebody working for you for free and expecting them to be  producing work for the company. Do just bear in mind that when you are hiring  people, you do need to pay them. The other part of a start-up employees compensation  package is made up of equity. Usually, this is again, the part that is the  way that they possibly create more wealth for themselves. It's really important that start-up founders  do give their employees equity, because it helps to incentivize everybody to work towards the  same thing, which is creating a successful company. Often in the early days, for employees,  they are being paid below market rate. Still above minimum wage, but below market rate.  Giving them stock in the company is a way to compensate them for that reduction  in cash that they're potentially seeing. It increases their upside. It's really important that you  are generous with shares. Particularly in the early days, because the people who are going  to be employee number one, two, three are going to be with you for a  long time. They're going to be working really hard in the same way that the  founders are. They're going to be setting how the company goes forward. They're going to  be doing a lot of stuff. It's important that they are motivated in the same  way. There's a rule of thumb, you can think about giving maybe 10% of the  company to the first 10 employees, but obviously on a sliding scale. Employee one gets  more than employee two, who gets more than employee three, etc. The reason why it's  not that much of a gamble to be generous, is that all of these will  have vesting. All of these employees will have vesting on their shares. If something doesn't  actually work out and you have to fire the employee, which when you are hiring  people, generally start-ups make a lot of mistakes and they have to fire a lot  of people. You're not going to be too burnt by that, because the vesting means  that the company has the right to repurchase their shares. The way that companies usually  structure this, they create a stock plan, which is again another bunch of legal documents  which need to be signed and kept. They, again, can be done on Clerky or  you can use a lawyer to do those for you. You can either issue shares  or you can issue options from that stock plan. Usually what you tend to find  is that employees are issued options which means that they have the option to pay  to buy shares in the future. But the price is set now. What this means  that is good for the employees is they don't have to pay cash immediately. They  can actually exercise their options in the future, when the company is looking like a  successful or even in conjunction with an acquisition or something. They don't' even end up  anywhere in an active pocket. There are some tax consequences to that, which is too  much detail to get into now. There's a lot of resources online about options, about  how to issue options, about the pros and cons of them. If you're interested, there's  lots out there. Finally, the other thing on this is it's really important to communicate  to your employees what they're getting in terms of equity. First of all, you need  to be clear to yourself what they're getting. Which means that you need to understand  the number of shares they're getting and what that represents in terms of percentage of  the company. Because if you only give them one and not the other, it gets  very confusing. Because you can say, "You have X percent of the company." But what  does that mean? X percent of what? Whereas, if you say, "You have a 100,000  shares." Well, what does that mean? Is that a lot of the company or is  that a small amount of the company? Clear in your head and then be clear  with the employee about what's going on. All right. Final topic is just a couple  of reminders about things that you have to do to be a legitimate company. It's  important that you keep all of these documents that we're talking about in a safe  place. You're going to need them at stressful times. You're going to need them during  acquisitions. You're going to need them during fundraising due diligence. You're going to need them  so many times, that if you don't have them all stored, in signed format, it's  just going to make your life really hard. Keep all your documents in a safe  place. Just assign one of the co-founders to be responsible for this. You should make  sure you know your key metrics in the company, which again is going to be  covered in a lot more detail throughout the course. But it's the kind of thing  that, again, you just want to have off the top of your head immediately. Also,  you should make sure that the money that you're spending, that the investors have given  to you is being spent sensibly. Spend money on things that will increase the chances  of the company being a success. These investors have trusted you with their money to  try to multiply their money. They haven't given you their money to go off to  Vegas, which happened to one of our companies a few years ago, where one of  the founders took quite a lot of company money, went to Vegas, had a great  time, according to Facebook and the founders and investors found out, and that founder got  fired. Actually he could have faced criminal charges as well. They decided not to press  charges. Just bear in mind, that this is the company's money and what it should  be used for. Okay. In conclusion, that was a really fast run through of some  of the basics. Don't expect you to be experts in any of this. Don't expect  you to have all of this figured out. It's just important that you know that  there are some things that you need to do. These items up here are the  really key take aways for this to just bear in mind as you go forward  with your companies. Okay. I think we have couple of minutes for questions, if there  are any.
Audience: For the employee shares, what's generous for the first five employees? You said the word  generous.
Kristy Nathoo: It depends, because it depends on the kind of hires that you're giving. If your  first hire is going to be a software engineer, that's going to be very different  if your first hire is a community manager. For the first 10 is usually somewhere  around 10%, maybe for the first five you want to be somewhere around seven to  eight mark. It really varies and part of this is you have to think ahead.  You don't want to be giving employee number one 30% of the company, and employee  number two 20% of the company, because you're going to run out of company to  give them. It's part of planning ahead for your hiring needs.
Audience: How much transparency should there be inside the company of the cap table? How should  that change as you grow ?
Kristy Nathoo: In the early days, when it's just the founders, there should be a 100% transparency.  Everybody should know everything. Generally, as the company grows, it becomes slightly less. You wouldn't  show a line by line cap table to your employees, for instance. But obviously there's  transparency of saying, "You have this number of shares and the total number of shares  is this" is going to give them the information that they need. Because they really  only care about themselves. They don't care ... Actually, that's not true, is it? That's  true that they care about themselves, they don't care ... They shouldn't care about what  the person next to them getting. You wouldn't share that information.
Audience: For organizations that may have a faster path to profitability and a longer path to  exit, is it still best practice to give out equity, instead of doing things like  profit sharing?
Kristy Nathoo: If you're looking at a start-up, the general start-up idea of growth and most of  the value is created by equity. It's a good idea to generally compensate people through  equity. If you're looking at more of something that's more of a lifestyle business, which  can be a great business for two or three founders who don't take outside money  and create a business that's very profitable from the start, then yes. Maybe doing some  kind of profit share or some kind of very generous bonus scheme or something like  that is a better answer. Usually that's not the case for start-ups. Usually, they're not  profitable for a long time.
Audience: How do these different things differ if you have more of a non for profit  or social good face company that's main necessarily becoming the biggest ?
Kristy Nathoo: Non profits are very different. Because there isn't this idea of owning shares and things,  so that's a whole different idea. There's also rules around how much you can pay  employees in non profits. On a social good companies, it depends on what sort of  a company it is. Again, you need to decide in a way of what your  mentality. Is your mentality still to be like a start-up even though you're going to  do some something that gives back. You can still have a start-up mentality in that.  You'd probably still want to go down that path of having equity and having that  conversation in that way. You can still fundraise as well as a social good kind  of company. It's a little bit harder, but you can still do it.
Audience: Let's say you granted those 10% to your first 10 employees and you are going  through another round of funding. Do you dilute only co-founders or also those first employees?
Kristy Nathoo: No. Generally ... This gets a little bit complex, but the simple answer is that  subsequent round of fundraising will dilute all existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holding,  it's a little bit more complex than that, but that's the general-  Yeah. You need to make that employees will know that you might be giving them  shares now that represent one percent of the company. But by the time they get  to an exit, it might represent 0.01 percent of the company. But in that respect,  they probably been given more later on and this idea of the pie being much  bigger. Even one percent of the company that's worth zero is still worth much less  than 0.1 percent of a company that's worth a 100 million dollars.
Audience: Just differences between preferred shares and the common shares?
Kristy Nathoo: The investors get preferred shares and as the title suggests, they have some preferences. I'm  not a lawyer, I'm a finance person. I can do this in a very top  level explanation. Basically they have a bunch of rights that common holders don't have. They  have things like liquidation preferences, which means that when the company exists, they're first in  line to get their proceeds to get the amount of money that they invested back,  before anybody else does. For example, if investors invested two million dollars into a company  and then it got sold, but the cash was ... Sorry, they invested two million  dollars into a company and they own 20%. But the cash that came out of  an exit further down the road was only two million dollars. They would see all  their money, before any of the common holders i.e. The founders would see their. That's  one. There's various other different protections that they have in there. That's probably the key  one, that's the financial basis. But then there's voting rights, there's right to refusal. There's  lots of different things, that's why it's a much more complex negotiation, because you have  to negotiate all of these rights within there.
Audience: Is there any specific company that you see it's really successful on the , you  don't have to say the company, but do you think there's a specific motto that  you think worked really well for company .
Kristy Nathoo: That's a great question. I think the companies that do this well are the ones  that are transparent. The ones that sit down with their employees and really talk through  what these things mean and what options are and how vesting works? Here's a scenario  where some companies will have ... If a company exits for this much money, what  does this mean to you? Whereas, if a company exits for this much money, how  will you see. They've done all of these calculations and they really make sure that  employees understand. I think that's a really good practice to have. What that needs first  is the founder's need to understand this, which is actually surprisingly not common. Often I  have a lot of conversations with founders where they don't understand this stuff. They can't  even explain it to their own employees. Understanding it yourself and being very clear with  employees is definitely ... And being organized as well.
Audience: 10% to the first 10 employees-
Kristy Nathoo: This is all just a rule of thumb.
Audience: Sure.
Kristy Nathoo: Everyone's fixating on this
Audience: My next question, the next rule of thumb is, after dilution, roughly how much of  the company do you think on average those first employees would end up owning at  an acquisition?
Kristy Nathoo: It really varies, because it depends when in the lifecycle of the company it gets  acquired. It depends how many fundraising rounds there's been. It depends how many more employees  have been after them. There's a lot of different variables there. The first money that  company's raised will be the most dilutive. If an employee comes in and there's already  been three rounds of money, then they're probably not going to be diluted as much,  as if there were the first employee and they have to go through all of  that dilution. It's hard to give a number.
Audience: Could you throw some light on how shares in Facebook were diluted?
Kristy Nathoo: No. I don't know any of the details. Sorry.
Audience: Do safe notes usually convert to preferred shares or to common equity?
Kristy Nathoo: SAFEs, not safe notes. They convert usually into preferred shares, because again the investors want  all of the rights and privileges that come with those preferred shares. There are some  circumstances where they might convert into a combination of preferred and common, but that's less  usual.
Audience: Have you seen any different types of vesting schedules for companies that are on a  longer term timeline, where the cliff might be longer than a year and a total  time might be more than four years?
Kristy Nathoo: I sometimes see companies push it out to five years. Also, sometimes companies don't have  the cliff at all. They just do monthly vesting over the period. But that is  a harder sell for the five year. The longer the time line, it's the harder  sell for the employees. You've got to be mindful of that. On the flip side,  what usually happens is if you've had an employee who's been with you for four  years, then they've been fairly diluted, because there's going to be funding round, there's going  to be subsequent employees. You would actually give them a new stock rounds on top  of the one they already have, which would then have new vesting from the date  that you granted it for them. Then they'll have another four year period there. That's  how you get through the long time period. Okay, last question.
Audience: Have you seen any situations where somebody can trade a common share for a preferred  share or the other way around? Is that common?
Kristy Nathoo: There wouldn't really be a case where you would trade common shares for preferred shares.  There is a mechanic in the fundraising, in the priced round documents that allows preferred  shares to be converted into common in various different circumstances. That's usually around exits and  calculation of proceeds and things like that. Are you trying to get at founder's preferred  shares?  Okay. All right. I think we ran out of time. Thank you very much for  listening, everyone. Enjoy the rest of the course.
