# How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman & Dustin Moskovitz

#如何和为什么启动创业-萨姆·奥特曼和达斯汀·莫斯科维茨

Sam Altman: Welcome. This is CS183F. Thank you all for coming. We hope to make it a  really great class. We're going to try to teach you what you need to know  for the first hundred days of a startup, basically how do you go from a  very raw idea, to a company.

山姆·阿尔特曼：欢迎。这是CS183F。谢谢你们能来。我们希望能使它成为一门非常棒的课程。我们试着教你在创业的头一百天里你需要知道的东西，基本上你是如何从一个非常原始的想法到一个公司的。

I'm the president of Y Combinator, my name is  Sam Altman.

我是Y Combinator公司的总裁，我叫山姆·奥特曼。

I've been teaching these people for a while, and so hopefully we'll be  able to make this make a lot of sense. Today, our guest speaker, besides me,  is Dustin Moskovitz. Dustin was the CTO ... Was the co-founder of Facebook, and CTO  and VP of Engineering, I just learned, and is now the co-founder and CO of  Asana. Dustin gave a talk at the first version of this class, that is still  the one I refer other people to the most.

我已经教了这些人一段时间了，希望我们能让这一切变得更有意义。今天，除了我之外，我们的特邀演讲者是达斯汀·莫斯科维茨。达斯汀是首席技术官.。我刚刚了解到，他是Facebook的联合创始人，也是CTO和工程副总裁，现在是Asana的联合创始人和CO。达斯汀在这门课的第一节课上做了一个演讲，这仍然是我推荐给其他人最多的一个版本。

It's about why to start a  start up, which is actually a really important question, and one that people don't think  about enough. He was kind enough to come back and do that again.

这是一个关于为什么要启动的问题，这实际上是一个非常重要的问题，也是人们没有充分考虑的问题。他好心地回来再做一次。

Dustin M: So if you're here today, your watching the video later, you're probably planning to start  a company. That's why you're taking the course. Most of the class is going to  be about how to go about doing that and achieving success. But before you dive  into the how of being an entrepreneur, I'm here to help you think about the  why.

达斯汀·M：如果你今天在这里，稍后再看视频，你可能会计划成立一家公司。所以你才选这门课。这门课的大部分内容都是关于如何做到这一点，并取得成功。但在你深入探讨如何成为一名企业家之前，我是来帮助你思考原因的。

It's important to know which reason is yours, so that you think though the  decision correctly.

重要的是要知道哪个是你的理由，这样你才能正确地思考这个决定。

I hear a variety of common motivators from potential entrepreneurs, but I found  that once they fully considered the trade off, they often decide that starting a company  isn't actually the best way to achieve their goals.

我从潜在的企业家那里听到了很多共同的激励因素，但我发现一旦他们充分考虑了这种权衡，他们往往会认为创办一家公司实际上并不是实现他们目标的最佳方式。

I'll help you make sure you're  choosing the best solution, and I'll also explain the reason I like to hear best  from people about why they want to start a company, what I hear when I  think someone is really set up for success.

我会帮助你确保你选择了最好的解决方案，我也会解释为什么我最喜欢从人们那里听到为什么他们想要成立一家公司，以及当我认为某人真正为成功做好准备的时候我听到了什么。

I've given this talk before, as Sam  said, and a bunch of people have come up to me after and said it  really helped them with their decision.

就像萨姆说的，我以前做过这个演讲，后来有一群人来找我，说这真的对他们的决定有帮助。

In a few cases, they decided that they shouldn't  start a company and they should really join an established one. But, I know a  lot of you are resolved on what you're doing.

在一些情况下，他们决定他们不应该成立一个公司，他们应该真正加入一个既定的公司。但是，我知道你们中的很多人决心要做什么。

If that's true, no problem.

如果是真的没问题。

I  think this will still be useful for you because you'll get a better sense of  the reality of what you're about to go through.

我认为这对你仍然是有用的，因为你会更好地感受到你将要经历的现实。

It's not a long talk, it's  just about 10 slides and I have left some time for questions at the end.  Let's call a spade a spade. A lot of people become entrepreneurs specifically as a  way to try to become extremely wealthy. They see themselves starting the next Facebook or  Google. However, the odds of being that successful are actually incredibly small. Only an handful  in an entire generation of companies actually end up getting to that scale. Here's a  funnel from C B Insights, actually.

这不是一个长谈，它只是10张幻灯片，我已经留了一些时间在最后的问题。让我们直言不讳。许多人成为企业家，特别是作为一种尝试成为极端富有的方式。他们看到自己开创了下一个Facebook或谷歌。然而，成功的几率实际上是非常小的。实际上，在整个一代人的公司中，只有少数几家公司最终达到了这样的规模。实际上，这是一个从CB洞察到的漏斗。

It shows how many seed funded tech companies get  through ground of funding. Even if we reduce our ambitions a bit to becoming a  unicorn so with a company with a billion dollar valuation, you still have incredibly long  odds. Only one percent of seed funded companies get all the way through this funnel.  Now, getting the six rounds of funding, it's not exactly the same as becoming unicorn,  but it's pretty well correlated. Most of the unicorns I know had to have at  least that many rounds of funding. So, to get there, you have to have a  truly great idea.

它显示了有多少种子资助的科技公司通过了融资。即使我们把我们的野心降低到成为独角兽，对一家估值达到10亿美元的公司来说，你仍然有着难以置信的很长的可能性。只有1%的种子公司能通过这个漏斗。现在，获得六轮资金，这与成为独角兽并不完全一样，但两者之间有着很好的相关性。我认识的大多数独角兽至少要有这么多的资金。因此，要达到这个目标，你必须有一个真正的好主意。

It's got to be unique, defensible, going after a large market. You  have to execute extremely well. That means you have to work hard. You have to  attract the right people, and you have to have a better strategy than your competitors.  You also just have to be really, really lucky because there's a lot of things  that can get in your way and a lot of them aren't even in your  control.

它必须是独特的，防御的，追求一个巨大的市场。你必须执行得非常好。这意味着你必须努力工作。你必须吸引合适的人，你必须有一个比你的竞争对手更好的战略。你也必须非常，非常幸运，因为有很多事情会妨碍你，而很多事情甚至不在你的掌控之中。

I've talked to a bunch of investors entrepreneurs and that it's actually getting harder  over time to get through this funnel. Not only are more people starting companies, but  then you have more people to compete with. But they're becoming more expensive to operate  for a lot of reasons, particularly here in the Bay area.

我和一群投资者-企业家-谈过，事实上，随着时间的推移，要通过这个漏斗变得越来越困难。不仅有更多的人开始创业，而且你有更多的人可以与之竞争。但由于种种原因，它们的运营成本越来越高，尤其是在海湾地区。

Investors have higher expectations,  too. You've seen valuation multiples start to decline, particularly on the public market. Perhaps, most  importantly, its' becoming harder to disrupt incumbents. They're not the slow moving giants that they  were 10 or 20 years ago. They know how to take advantage of their market  position. Some of you are thinking, sure it's hard, but you get so much more  equity as a founder that it's clearly the only way to make a lot of  money. Let's talk about two different ways that you might get to a greater financial  outcome. Story one, you're the founder. You started a company that does Uber for pet  sitting.

投资者也有更高的期望。你已经看到估值倍数开始下降，尤其是在公开市场。也许，最重要的是，它“越来越难扰乱现任者”。他们不是10或20年前那些行动缓慢的巨人。他们知道如何利用自己的市场地位。你们中的一些人认为，当然这很难，但作为一名创始人，你们获得了更多的股权，这显然是赚很多钱的唯一途径。让我们谈谈两种不同的方式，你可能会获得更好的财务结果。故事一，你是创始人。你创办了一家专门为宠物打理打车的公司。

In this picture, this is the customer, not the founder.

在这张图中，这是客户，而不是创始人。

It's a great idea  and you executed it well. So, you sell the company at some point for a  hundred million dollars.

这是个好主意，你执行得很好。所以，你在某个时候以一亿美元的价格卖掉了公司。

If you've been really successful limiting dilution, your equity might be as  high as 10 percent of the company at that point by the time it becomes  liquid. So you're walking away with ten million dollars. Pretty great outcome. However, I just  showed you only a small portion of startups make it that far, so this is  the lucky case. A hundred million dollars, a little easier than a billion dollars, but  it's still extremely rare.

如果你真的成功地限制了稀释，那么当你的公司变得流动性强的时候，你的股本可能高达公司的10%。所以你就拿着一千万美元走了。非常好的结果。然而，我只是向你展示了一小部分初创企业能够做到这一点，所以这是幸运的情况。一亿美元，比十亿美元容易一点，但仍然非常罕见。

It's most likely that you end up with nothing on this  path because you just end up shutting down the company for whatever reason. Oftentimes you  see a company sell to an acquirer at this kind of range valuation.

很可能你在这条路上一无所有，因为你只是因为任何原因而关闭了公司。通常情况下，你会看到一家公司在这种范围内向收购方出售。

In a  lot of those cases, the founder still ends up with nothing because of the investor  liquidity preference.

在很多情况下，由于投资者的流动性偏好，创始人最终还是一无所有。

It depends a lot on how much money you've raised to get there.  This is definitely the high risk path. Another way to make a similar amount of  money is to join a later stage company and help them scale from, say, five  hundred million in valuation to twenty billion. Even straight out of college, you can do  really well financially by joining a company at that stage. Especially if you have a  few years of experience, you're going to get a really good options package. You're going  to have a fairly high salary, too.

这在很大程度上取决于你筹集了多少钱才能到达那里。这绝对是高风险的道路。另一种获得类似金额的方法是加入一家后期公司，帮助他们从五亿美元的估值增长到200亿美元。即使刚从大学毕业，你也可以在那个阶段加入一家公司，在经济上做得很好。特别是如果你有几年的经验，你会得到一个非常好的选择包。你的薪水也会很高。

I just sort of swagged five basis points  here.

我只是在这里摆了五个基点。

If you join a little earlier, it might be more than that.

如果你早点加入，可能会更多。

If you  have more experience, it might be more than that. But, this is sort of a  good benchmark. And you probably know the market, for experienced tech workers is extremely competitive  right now particularly for product roles.

如果你有更多的经验，它可能会更多。但是，这是一个很好的基准。你可能知道市场，因为经验丰富的技术人员现在非常有竞争力，尤其是在产品角色方面。

If you choose well, you can also walk away  with ten million dollars by taking this path.

如果你选择得好，你也可以拿着一千万美元走这条路。

If you choose really well, and you  do find that next space for Google while it's still not a unicorn, you can  do extremely well. The Hundredth Engineer Case Book had a way better financial outcome than  the vast majority of entrepreneurs. Of course, it's still possible you'll choose the wrong company.  It won't grow enough for this kind of outcome. This is actually 40X growth which  is pretty impressive. The key is you get to join it much later in its  life cycles. You have a lot more information. You can see the performance so far.  You can meet some of the team. You can understand the competitive landscape. Even if  you don't find the company that's going to grow this much, you've got a good  chance of picking one that's going to grow some.

如果你选择得很好，而且你在谷歌还不是独角兽的时候找到了下一个空间，你可以做得非常好。第100位工程师案例书比绝大多数企业家有更好的财务结果。当然，你还是有可能选择错误的公司。它不会长得足够满足这样的结果。这实际上是40倍的增长，这是相当令人印象深刻的。关键是在它的生命周期中，你可以在更晚的时候加入它。你有更多的信息。到目前为止你可以看到表演。你可以见见队里的一些人。你可以理解竞争格局。即使你找不到一家能成长这么多的公司，你也有很好的机会选择一家能成长的公司。

In fact, your equity value is  probably already nonzero. So, you've got a pretty good chance of having a positive outcome  in that situation and maybe a really great outcome. Finally, if you've found a company,  you have a long term commitment. There's a good chance you're going to be putting  10 years or more into making it scale. And you still may fail in the  end. Whereas if you join an established company, you can work there for a couple  of years. You can get a sense of whether it's growing.

事实上，你的股权价值可能已经不是零了。所以，在这种情况下，你有很大的机会获得积极的结果，也许是一个非常好的结果。最后，如果你找到了一家公司，你就有了长期的承诺。你很有可能投入10年甚至更长的时间来扩大规模。你最终还是会失败的。然而，如果你加入一家已经成立的公司，你可以在那里工作几年。你可以感觉到它是否在生长。

If not, you can  usually leave and try again. You can actually work for several different ones in that  same 10 year period and that really increases your chances of a home run. The  ultimate takeaway here is there are multiple ways to get a great financial outcome. But  it's a lot lower risk to join an established company. Don't worry, not all of  these will be arguments about why you should join an established company. Similarly, a lot  of people want to start a company in order to maximize their impact. Usually, financial  outcome is pretty well correlated with that. A lot of the arguments I just made  apply here as well. But when you join a company that's already established, you get  some big advantages. You get access to their existing user base.

如果没有，你通常可以离开，然后再试一次。实际上，你可以在同样的10年内为几个不同的项目工作，这确实增加了你的全垒打的机会。最终的好处是，有多种方法可以获得一个很好的财务结果。但加入一家老牌公司的风险要低得多。别担心，并不是所有这些都是关于你为什么要加入一家老牌公司的争论。同样的，很多人想要创办一家公司，以最大限度地发挥他们的影响力。通常，财务结果与此密切相关。我刚才提出的许多论点也适用于此。但当你加入一家已经成立的公司时，你会得到一些巨大的优势。您可以访问他们现有的用户群。

It might be hundreds  of millions, sometimes a billion people. You get the ability to work on top of  infrastructure that's already been built out and scaled. And you're collaborating with an established team,  so they're going to help you succeed.

它可能是数亿，有时是10亿人。您可以在已经构建并扩展的基础设施之上工作。你正在和一个成熟的团队合作，所以他们会帮助你成功。

I want to give some concrete examples of  massive impact that people achieved as an employee. Brett Taylor who is the head of  Quip, before he became an entrepreneur, he joined Google after it already had over a  thousand employees. There he was able to spearhead the creation of Google Maps which is  used by hundreds of millions of people, including me on my way here today. Similarly,  my co-founder at Asana, Justin Rosenstein, he joined Google at a similar time. There he  prototyped Gchat inside of Gmails. This was over 10 years ago, still used by a  ton of people. Then, shortly after that, he went to Facebook after it had a  few hundred employees. He led the hackathon project that created the Like button. Some of  you have probably used it once or twice. You can still join teams at Facebook  and Google today and work on something that literally might reach a billion people. That's  a lot of impact even if your contribution is a relatively small portion of the  product surface area.

我想举一些具体的例子，说明人们作为一名雇员所取得的巨大影响。布雷特·泰勒(BrettTaylor)在成为一名企业家之前，在谷歌拥有1000多名员工之后，他加入了谷歌。在那里，他率先创建了谷歌地图，它被数以百万计的人使用，包括我今天来这里的路上。同样，我在Asana公司的联合创始人贾斯汀·罗森斯坦(Justin Rosenstein)也在类似的时间加入了谷歌。在那里，他在Gmail中制作了Gchat原型。这是十多年前的事了，至今仍被许多人使用。之后不久，在Facebook有几百名员工之后，他就去了Facebook。他领导了创建类似按钮的黑客马拉松项目。你们中的一些人可能用过一两次。今天，你仍然可以加入Facebook和Google的团队，致力于一项可能触及10亿人的项目。这是一个很大的影响，即使你的贡献是相对较小的部分产品表面积。

If you want to become an entrepreneur and maximize impact, these are  the types of stories that I think you should be comparing opportunity to. Next, there's  lifestyle. Everyone's got their own story about what it means to be an entrepreneur.

如果你想成为一名企业家并最大限度地发挥影响力，我认为你应该把这些故事与机会进行比较。接下来是生活方式。作为一名企业家，每个人都有自己的故事。

In  general, the media likes to make it seem glamorous, emphasizing launches and funding milestones. They  tend to talk about success cases and ignore failures. The entrepreneurs themselves are like ducks.  They're calm on the surface, but they're paddling like hell underneath. But you only get  to see them on that surface, looking passionate and focused. The first image here is  from the Social Network which is a fictional movie about the founding of Facebook.

总的来说，媒体喜欢让它显得光彩夺目，强调启动和资助的里程碑。他们倾向于谈论成功案例而忽略失败。企业家本身就像鸭子。它们表面上很平静，但它们在下面像地狱一样划水。但你只能在表面上看到他们，看上去充满激情和专注。这里的第一张图片来自社交网络，这是一部虚构的关于Facebook创建的电影。

It  looks pretty fun. The last image is an actual photo from the founding of Facebook.  They're a little different. Reality is a lot of heads down time doing hard work.  We hardly had any time to bust open champagne and spray it all over our  laptops.

看起来挺有趣的。最后一张照片是Facebook创建时的真实照片。他们有点不同。现实是很多人下意识做艰苦工作的时候。我们几乎没有时间打开香槟，把它喷到笔记本电脑上。

In practice, tech is a little less like the Social Network and more like  Silicon Valley.

实际上，科技不太像社交网络，更像硅谷。

It's actually really stressful. Why is that? Well, a few reasons. One, your  team is relying on you, so they're betting some of their best years on the  story you've told them. And there are recruiters pinging them constantly, like many times a  week. You're always worried you're going to lose them. Each round of fund raising feels  a little like life and death and your competitors are actually trying to kill you.  You always feel stretched thin because it's hard to make time for the company, your  significant other, your family, and yourself. Of course, my title here is a reference to  Ben Horowitz's book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things.

实际上压力很大。那是为什么？有几个原因。第一，你的团队依靠你，所以他们把最好的几年都押在了你讲给他们听的故事上。而且，招聘人员也在不停地敲打他们，就像每周有很多次一样。你总是担心你会失去他们。每一轮筹资都会让人觉得生死攸关，而你的竞争对手却在试图杀死你。你总是感到疲惫不堪，因为你很难为公司、你的另一半、你的家人和你自己腾出时间。当然，我这里的标题是引用本·霍洛维茨的书“艰难的事情”。

If you want to go, like,  way deep on this subject, I'd definitely recommend giving that a read. Relatedly, people also  think being a founder will give you control over how you spend your time. Here's  a great quote from Phil Leibinger.

如果你想深入研究这个问题，我肯定会建议你读一读。与此相关的是，人们还认为，作为一个创始人，你可以控制自己的时间。这是菲尔·莱宾格的名言。

I'll give you a sec to read it. Phil  and I both learned this the hard way, but you don't actually have control in  practice.

我给你点时间看看。菲尔和我都很难学到这一点，但你在实践中并没有实际的控制能力。

I spend most of my time working on the problems I just couldn't delegate.  Reacting to issues that are popping up, resolving conflicts. And you're always on call so  it makes it hard to really unplug during a vacation or on the weekends. And  you're a role model, too.

我把大部分时间都花在那些我无法委派的问题上。对突然出现的问题作出反应，解决冲突。而且你总是随叫随到，所以在假期或周末很难拔掉插头。你也是个榜样。

If you take your foot off the gas, then so  will your team. That said, this one really doesn't apply if you want to have  a lifestyle business or if your like a small business entrepreneur.

如果你把你的脚从油门上脱下来，你的团队也会。也就是说，如果你想做一个生活方式的生意，或者你想做一个小企业家，这一条就不适用了。

If you do that,  then you actually do have a lot of control over your lifestyle, but the financial  and impact outcomes are going to be smaller. This is a recap of those first  four topics. These are the top reasons I usually hear from people. The successful one  that I showed you in practice suggests that startups aren't clearly the best way to  maximize financial reward or impact. You might do better by joining an established company. Similarly,  the reality of entrepreneurship usually doesn't match what you see in the media.

如果你这样做了，那么你实际上对你的生活方式有很大的控制，但是财务和影响的结果会更小。这是前四个主题的概述。这些是我通常从人们那里听到的最重要的原因。我在实践中向你们展示的成功经验表明，初创企业显然不是最大化财务回报或影响力的最佳途径。你可以通过加入一家已经成立的公司来做得更好。同样，创业的现实往往与你在媒体上看到的不一样。

If you  want to aim for a home run, you should feel committed to putting in the  many years of effort and discipline that it takes to become a professional athlete. And  you still may fail. Now that I've given you a bunch of bad news, let's  talk about what I see as the best reason for starting a company ... So  basically you can't not do it. This has two roots. The first is passion. Passion  it truly important since we just talked about how hard it is to start a  company. You're going to need that passion to power through. You also need it to  recruit great people to follow you as a leader. The second part of this is  that you're the right person to make this happen by starting a company.

如果你想把目标对准一个全垒打，你应该有决心投入多年的努力和纪律，这需要成为一名职业运动员。你可能还会失败。现在我告诉你们一些坏消息，让我们谈谈我认为创办一家公司的最佳理由.所以基本上你不能这么做。这有两个根源。首先是激情。激情-这真的很重要，因为我们刚刚谈到创业有多难。你需要那种激情才能通过。你也需要它来招募伟大的人跟随你作为一个领导者。第二部分是你是通过创办一家公司来实现这一目标的合适人选。

If you  fail to do it, you're actually going to be depriving the world of something great.  This implies that the idea itself is really valuable and it also implies that you're  the best person to bring that idea into the world.

如果你不这样做，你实际上是在剥夺世界上一些伟大的东西。这意味着这个想法本身是非常有价值的，也意味着你是把这个想法带入世界的最佳人选。

If you're not the best  person, then that person is out there and they're probably going to out compete you  and create something even more valuable. One twist on this is maybe you're the best  person, but you should do it within the context of an existing company.

如果你不是最好的人，那么那个人就在外面，他们可能会和你竞争，创造更有价值的东西。也许你是最好的人，但你应该在现有公司的背景下这样做。

I often  feel this way when I hear someone describe something to me that really sounds like  a feature of an existing product.

当我听到有人对我描述一些听起来真的像是现有产品的特性的东西时，我就会有这种感觉。

If you want to have the next twist on  photo sharing, I definitely recommend considering Instagram or Snapchat and helping them build it into  their products. You can be entrepreneurial inside the context of an existing company.

如果你想在照片分享上有下一个转折，我绝对建议考虑Instagram或Snapchat，并帮助他们将其构建到他们的产品中。在现有公司的背景下，你可以创业。

I've twice  chosen to become an entrepreneur, myself. Both of the times were motivated by this reason  exactly. For Facebook, we actually continued to be students at Harvard until the site had  over a hundred thousand monthly active users. We had cognitive dissidence. We were kind of  on an embarrassing long period of time that we could just be students and have  this little side project on the side. Eventually, it pulled us out because we couldn't  bear the idea of it not living up to its full potential. Similarly, at Asana,  Justin and I were both reluctant entrepreneurs, but we thought the problem of work tracking  was really important and that the other people were working on it were going to  develop incremental solutions and leave a lot of value on the table. We couldn't stop  working on it. Eventually we decided to leave Facebook and focus on it full time.  When I meet entrepreneurs that really seem set up for success, this is usually the  reason I'm hearing from them. They're starting a company because it felt like really the  only thing that they could do next. That's it. Short and sweet. We have time  for questions.

我已经两次选择成为一名企业家，我自己。这两次都正是出于这个原因。对于Facebook，我们实际上一直是哈佛大学的学生，直到该网站每月拥有超过10万名活跃用户。我们有认知分歧。我们在一个令人尴尬的长时间，我们可以只是学生，并有一个小的副业。最终，它把我们拉了出来，因为我们无法忍受它没有充分发挥其潜力的想法。同样，在Asana公司，贾斯汀和我都是不情愿的企业家，但我们认为工作跟踪的问题真的很重要，其他人正在研究这个问题，他们会开发出渐进的解决方案，并在谈判桌上留下大量的价值。我们无法停止这方面的工作。最后，我们决定离开Facebook，专注于它的全职工作。当我遇到那些真正为成功做好准备的企业家时，这通常就是我从他们那里听到的原因。他们正在创办一家公司，因为这似乎是他们下一步能做的唯一件事。就这样又短又甜。我们有时间提问。

I don't know what my cutoff time is.

我不知道我的截止时间是什么。

Sam Altman: A few minutes.

山姆·奥特曼：几分钟。

Dustin M: Few minutes? All right, cool. Feel free to just raise your hands and I'll call  on you and repeat the question from the mike. Someone always has to break the  bubble, but like 10 of you ...

达斯汀·M：几分钟？好吧，酷。请举手，我会打电话给你，然后重复麦克风上的问题。总有人要打破泡沫，但就像你们中的10个.

Speaker 3: I have one.

演讲者3：我有一个。

Dustin M: Okay.

达斯汀·M：好的。

Speaker 3: How do you decide if its ... How do you advise people for this side  if the best way is to go do this at some other company, or do  it themselves? Like it's easy in the photo sharing example, but in the real world,  most of the time it's a little bit murkier. What's the framework you think through  about(inaudible)
Dustin M: Two things. One is sort of like feature not company distinction like Mark and has  talked about.

你怎么决定它是否.。如果最好的方法是到其他公司去做这件事，或者自己去做，你该如何建议这方面的人呢？就像照片分享的例子很简单，但是在现实世界中，大多数时候它会更模糊一些。你思考的框架是什么(听不见的)达斯汀M：两件事。一种是类似的功能，而不是马克所说的公司的区别。

I don't know how to make that concrete, but it's just sort of  like thinking about the ideas.

我不知道怎样做具体的东西，但这有点像在思考那些想法。

Is this like a separate product that it feels like  somebody is going to sign up for? Can it have its own monetization model? Are  people really going to invest in learning a new system or does it really feel  like the add-on on top of some existing model? And very related to that, I  think, are just going to be the competitive nature.

这是否像一个单独的产品，感觉像是有人要注册？它能有自己的货币化模式吗？人们是真的要投资于学习一个新的系统，还是真的觉得它是一些现有模式的补充？与此相关的是，我认为，这将是竞争的本质。

If you have to introduce like  a whole new photo sharing app, and then you have to compete with the distribution  and network effect of the existing ones, that's a huge barrier to entry. There are  sort of similar metaphors in other products. Does that make sense?
Speaker 3: Sure.

如果你必须推出一个全新的照片分享应用，然后你必须与现有应用的分销和网络效果竞争，这是一个巨大的进入障碍。在其他产品中也有类似的隐喻。这有道理吗？演讲者3：当然。

Dustin M: That's going to require judgment. You and then you.

达斯汀·M：这需要判断力。你然后是你。

Speaker 4: I was wondering like what's your thought on like the challenges starting a company when  you started a company and starting like .

演讲者4：我想知道你的想法是什么，比如当你创办一家公司的时候，你会遇到什么样的挑战。

Dustin M: I sort of briefly outlined them when I was talking about the funnel. Yes, sorry.  The question was about the difference in challenges between starting a company basically in 2004  for starting a company today. Or the second time in 2009.

达斯汀·M：当我谈到漏斗的时候，我简要地概述了它们。是的，对不起。问题是，在2004年创办一家公司对今天的公司的挑战有多大不同。或者是2009年的第二次。

I sort of outlined  them when I was talking about the funnel.

当我谈到漏斗的时候，我大致勾勒出了它们。

I definitely think it's just a lot  more competitive in terms of the other businesses out there. Most of the valuable markets  have interesting players already.

我肯定认为，就其他业务而言，它的竞争力要大得多。大多数有价值的市场已经有了有趣的参与者。

It's also very competitive in the recruiting market.

它在招聘市场上也很有竞争力。

It's really hard  to get a big enough team of sufficiently talented people, and those people are going  to be more expensive. That's one of the ways that costs have gone up. There's  also a bunch of other ways, including just like real estate in the Bay area  is really expensive right now. Some other costs have come down like data center costs,  but in general, it just feels higher friction and harder to get going.

要想拥有一支足够有才华的团队真的很难，而且这些人的成本也会更高。这是成本上升的方式之一。还有很多其他的方式，包括就像海湾地区的房地产现在真的很贵一样。其他一些成本下降了，就像数据中心的成本一样，但总的来说，它只是感觉到更大的摩擦和更难开始。

Speaker 5: You mentioned there's a comparison between startup like being a founder and then being on  . How do you position that early stage? Say like maybe the first of 10  kind of people?
Dustin M: Yeah, it's just somewhere on that spectrum. So sorry, the question is, what's the difference  between being a sort of later employee at an established company versus being like an  early employee? Is that the question? I think of it as just the spectrum on  the risk scale between like founder and like one thousandth employee.

演讲者5：你提到了创业和创业之间的比较，比如创业和创业。你如何定位早期阶段？就像10种人中的第一种？达斯汀·M：是的，就在那个光谱的某个地方。很抱歉，问题是，在一家已经成立的公司当一名后来的雇员和像一个早期的雇员有什么区别呢？这就是问题所在吗？我认为这仅仅是创办人和千分之一员工之间的风险范围。

If you're in the  first 10, you have a little bit more information. You know who the founders are.  You know who leaders are. You can meet some of the investors. Hopefully, they've already  done a seed round or an A round. But usually, you still don't have evidence  yet about like the revenue or the monetization, and probably a product that isn't scaling  yet.

如果你是前10名，你有更多的信息。你知道创始人是谁。你知道谁是领导者。你可以见见一些投资者。希望他们已经做了种子轮或A轮。但通常情况下，你仍然没有像收入或货币化这样的证据，而且很可能是一个还没有扩大规模的产品。

It's just sort of continuous spectrum and the earlier you are, the lower your  salary is going to be. The lower the sort of probability of a positive outcome  is going to be, but you also have a possibility of a really big outcome  because you might have 50 basis points or a hundred basis points if you're one  of the first employees. Does that make sense?  Again, it's on the spectrum, right? Maybe the second employee. So, the question was, is  the probability of success basically equal? Yeah, for the second employ, yes. For the tenth  employ, no they've got a lot more information. For the twentieth, they've got even more  information.

这只是一个连续的频谱，你越早，你的薪水就越低。积极结果的可能性越低，但你也有可能得到一个非常大的结果，因为如果你是第一批员工之一，你可能有50个基点或100个基点。这有道理吗？再说一遍，它在光谱上，对吗？也许是第二个雇员。那么，问题是，成功的概率基本上是相等的吗？是的，为了第二份工作，是的。对于第十个雇员，不，他们有更多的信息。在第二十届会议上，他们得到了更多的信息。

It's just going to be a continuous spectrum. This question over here.

它只是一个连续的光谱。这里有个问题。

Speaker 6: How did you find your core team when you were founding like Asana and Facebook?  Did or did you go about like getting the best of each area?
Dustin M: Sure, so how did we go about finding the core team? At Facebook, pretty organic.  A lot of people were just like the people in our network at Harvard that  we moved out to Palo Alto with. And then, very early on, we hired Matt  Koler, and he sort of took over recruiting and helped us get into networking ...  into Stanford, actually, and a lot of the people we hired were recent graduates here.  We really focused on the product team first. A lot of it was very path  dependent and organic, working networks. Things are a little different now. As a small company  you can work with contractor recruiters, even with some of the services that help connect  people.

演讲者6：当你创建像Asana和Facebook这样的核心团队时，你是如何找到你的核心团队的？你是否喜欢把每一个领域都做得最好？达斯汀·M：当然，我们是怎么找到核心团队的？在Facebook上，非常有机。很多人和我们一起搬到帕洛阿尔托，就像我们在哈佛的关系网里的人一样。然后，很早的时候，我们雇佣了马特·科勒，他接管了招聘工作，帮助我们建立了关系网.事实上，我们雇佣的很多人都是刚毕业的。我们首先关注的是产品团队。其中很多都是非常依赖于路径和有机的，工作网络。现在情况有点不同了。作为一家小公司，您可以与承包商招聘人员合作，甚至可以使用一些帮助连接人员的服务。

I think those are pretty good.

我觉得很不错。

Speaker 7: I was thinking along the passion dimension. What are your thoughts along the lines from  say like interest to like pathological obsession?
Dustin M: The question is, when I talked about passion, am I just talking about an interest  in the subject or pathological obsession? Again, it's a spectrum, but probably more towards the  pathological obsession. When I say you can't not do it, it's like one of these  things where you'll look back twenty years from now and be like, man, I really  should have gone after that idea.

演讲者7：我是沿着激情维度思考的。从说出兴趣到喜欢病态痴迷，你的想法是什么？达斯汀·M：问题是，当我谈到激情时，我是在谈论对这个主题的兴趣还是病态的痴迷？再说一次，这是一个光谱，但可能更倾向于病态的困扰。当我说你做不到的时候，这就像一件事情，20年后你会回想起来，就像，伙计，我真的应该去追求这个想法。

It was really important to me. Whereas like interest,  I have a lot interests in the world. There not all necessarily important. And they're  not all going to keep my attention for like the 10 or 20 years that  you need to focus. How are we doing on time?
Sam Altman: One more.

对我来说真的很重要。和兴趣一样，我在这个世界上也有很多兴趣。不一定都很重要。他们不会把我的注意力集中在你需要关注的10到20年的时间里。我们准时过得怎么样？再来一次。

Dustin M: One more. Okay.

达斯汀·M：再来一次。好的。

Speaker 8: , should you always have a co-founder? And if so, how should you look for  that co-founder?
Dustin M: The question is about should you always have a co-founder and if so, how should  you look for that co-founder? This is a really tough one.

演讲者8：你应该总是有一个联合创始人吗？如果是这样的话，你该怎么找那个联合创始人呢？达斯汀·M：问题是，你应该总是有一个联合创始人吗？如果是的话，你应该如何寻找联合创始人呢？这真的很难。

I have a pretty  strong opinion that like co-founders are super important. Again, cause like this is really hard,  and that's like your buddy that you get to lean on. They're kind of like  in the trenches with you. But, if you don't have someone who is sort of  like the obvious person you want to work with, I don't have good advice on  how to do that.

我有一个非常强烈的观点，和联合创始人一样，他们是非常重要的。再说一遍，因为这样真的很难，这就像你的朋友，你可以依靠。就像和你在战壕里一样。但是，如果你没有像你想要共事的人那样的人，我对如何做到这一点没有很好的建议。

In both of my cases, like we were starting a company  together and like discussing it together the whole time. That sort of like founder dating  thing doesn't make as much sense to me.

在我的两种情况下，就像我们一起创办了一家公司，并且一直在一起讨论。那种类似创始人约会的事情对我来说没什么意义。

I actually think starting a company is  like an even more important relationship than like getting married or something because like financial  issues enter the conversation even more often. And founder breakups are really bad.

实际上，我认为创办一家公司比结婚之类的关系更重要，因为像财务问题这样的话题更多的出现在谈话中。创始人分手真的很糟糕。

I highly  recommend working with someone that you've known a long time and just discussing as many  of the details as possible to make sure you're on the same page cause those  conversations get a lot harder later. All right, so I'm going to wrap up.

我强烈建议和你认识很久的人合作，讨论尽可能多的细节，以确保你们在同一页上，因为这些谈话以后会变得困难得多。好吧，我要结束了。

Sam Altman: Thank you, Dustin. That was great.

山姆·阿尔特曼：谢谢你，达斯汀。太棒了。

I wanted to use today to sort of summarize  other things that we touched on in the class. Since it's just mostly guest lecturers,  this is my chance to say the things that I believe.

我想用今天的时间来总结我们在课堂上谈到的其他事情。因为主要是客座讲师，所以这是我说出我所相信的话的机会。

I wanted to start  off by talking about what makes Silicon Valley special. There are a hundred people in  the room in the class here at Stanford. There will be hundreds of thousands or  a million, low millions of people that watch this online around the world. As I  travel around the world talking about startups, the most common question I get is, why  Silicon Valley? What happens there that's different than everywhere else? Why can't we do this  where I'm from? I think it's an instruct question even for people living here because  you want to find out what this is and surround yourself with the most concentrated  version of it. The thing that I think is most important of all is there  is a relentless belief in the future here. There are people here who will take  your wild ideas seriously, instead of mocking you. And that's because they've learned it's very  expensive to just pass and say every idea is stupid.

我想先谈谈硅谷的特殊之处。斯坦福教室里有一百人。全世界将有数十万或一百万，数百万的人在网上观看这个节目。当我环游世界谈论创业公司时，我最常见的问题是，为什么是硅谷？与其他地方不同的是发生了什么？为什么我们不能在我的家乡做这个？我认为这是一个有指导意义的问题，甚至对于居住在这里的人来说也是如此，因为你想找出这是什么，并把它的最集中的版本围绕在自己身上。我认为最重要的是，我们对未来有着坚定的信念。这里有些人会认真对待你的疯狂想法，而不是嘲笑你。这是因为他们已经认识到，仅仅通过并且说每一个想法都是愚蠢的是非常昂贵的。

If you have someone that's  like, I'm going to start an electric car company. And they don't know much about  batteries, even less about cars, it would be very easy to write that off. And  yesterday Tesla passed Ford in the market cap. So people have learned that these wild  ideas about the future, you don't want to write them off too quickly. You want  to give them a real chance. You want to think about them.

如果你有这样的人，我要开一家电动汽车公司。他们对电池知之甚少，更不了解汽车，这很容易被抹掉。昨天，特斯拉的市值超过了福特。所以人们已经了解到，这些关于未来的疯狂想法，你不想太快就把它们抹掉。你想给他们一个真正的机会。你想想他们。

In most of  the world, and in most other work contexts, people will just mock you behind your  back, to your face, whatever it is. You really want to find the small number  of people in your life that will support your ambitions, not belittle your ambitions. And  this hard to find. This is not the default state. We don't realize how rare  it is that we're in an environment where that's what most people are like. There's  no tall poppy syndrome.

在世界上的大多数地方，在大多数其他的工作环境中，人们都会在你背后嘲笑你，当着你的面嘲笑你，不管它是什么。你真的很想在你的生活中找到少数人来支持你的抱负，而不是贬低你的雄心壮志。很难找到。这不是默认状态。我们没有意识到我们所处的环境是多么的罕见，因为大多数人都是这样的。没有高大的罂粟综合症。

In many other countries, many other cultures, there's a word for  what it is when if a person gets too tall, too ambitious, thinking too big,  you cut them down. There's not even really a phrase like that in America, but  there is one in most other cultures. There's also a very high density of people  working on startups here. And there's a culture of paying if forward. People help me  on my startup, I'm going to help them on theirs. And so you want to  surround yourself with this, no matter where you are in the world. You may find  that you have to go online to find that community, you still want to do  it. Oh, this is my old version of slides. Did I send you a new  one? We're just going to go with this. One of the things that startups really  have to get right is the idea. There's become this myth in Silicon Valley that  the idea doesn't matter. That you should start a startup and just sort of pivot  your way on this random walk and hope you get to something big. As Dustin  said, all of the best startups that we have funded at Y Combinator, it was  an idea first and startup second.

在许多其他国家，许多其他文化中，有一个词描述的是，如果一个人长得太高、太雄心勃勃、想得太大，你就会把他们砍掉。在美国，甚至没有这样的词语，但在大多数其他文化中都有这样的说法。这里也有非常高密度的创业人员。还有一种文化，如果向前，就会付出代价。在我创业的时候，人们会帮助我，我会在他们的公司里帮助他们。所以，无论你身在何处，你都想把自己包围在这个世界上。你可能会发现你必须上网才能找到那个社区，你仍然想这样做。这是我的旧版幻灯片。我给你寄了新的吗？我们就这么办吧。创业公司真正需要做的事情之一就是想法。硅谷已经形成了这样一个神话，即这个想法并不重要。你应该启动一家初创公司，在这种随机漫步中，你应该以一种支点的方式走下去，并希望你能得到一些重要的东西。正如达斯汀所说，我们在Y Combinator资助的所有最好的初创公司，首先是一个想法，第二个是创业。

I was not a bunch of pivots. The very  few pivots that were successful were when the founders discovered along the way that there  was some other idea they were more passionate about than their first one. Or, they  just learned some new problem. Original thought is really hard to get good at, but  really important. The most successful startups are not derivatives, they are not a copy of  something else that was working pretty well. Most people try to start a copy of  whatever worked last year.

我不是一群支点。很少几个成功的支点是当创始人们发现还有一些其他的想法比他们的第一个想法更有激情的时候。或者，他们只是学到了一些新的问题。最初的想法真的很难掌握，但很重要。最成功的初创公司不是衍生产品，它们不是其他运作良好的东西的复制品。大多数人试图开始复制去年起作用的东西。

I don't know how many people started a Facebook clone in  the year after Facebook. Had to be a lot. A lot. None of those went  on to really matter. The next Facebook never looks like Facebook.

我不知道在Facebook之后的一年里有多少人创建了Facebook克隆人。一定是很多。很多。这些都不重要。下一个脸书从来不像脸书。

It looks like something  totally different. The way to get good at this is to start noticing problems in  your own life. And the great advantage that you have as students is that students,  young people in general, tend to be on the forefront of technology. You can predict  the great wave before it happens. And this idea of the great wave, I think  this is the most important concept to find good ideas out there. People wonder why  startups cluster in small periods of time. Why were there a bunch of companies that  started in the late 90s, early 2000s that were really successful? Why were there a  bunch of startups between sort of 2009 and 2011 that started that were really successful?  The reason that there are these great waves, the Internet and mobile, in those two  cases, smart phones that all of a sudden new things are possible that were never  possible before. When that happens, because startups can move so quickly, you can do things  that otherwise a big company would win on. You want to think about what the  next great wave is. My personal best guess is that it will be machine learning  and just applied to every vertical.

看起来完全不同。要想更好地做到这一点，就要开始注意到自己生活中的问题。作为学生，你拥有的最大优势是，学生，一般是年轻人，倾向于走在科技的前列。你可以在巨浪发生之前预测它。而这个思想的巨浪，我认为这是最重要的概念，以找到好的想法在那里。人们不知道为什么初创企业会在短时间内聚集在一起。为什么有一群在90年代末，2000年代初成立的公司真的很成功？为什么在2009到2011年间，有一批初创公司真正成功了呢？为什么会有这些巨浪，互联网和移动，在这两种情况下，智能手机-突然之间，新事物成为可能-这是前所未有的。当这种情况发生的时候，因为初创企业的发展速度太快，你可以做一些大公司会赢的事情。你想想下一波巨浪是什么。我个人的猜测是，它将是机器学习，并应用于每一个垂直。

I think that's the easiest layup right now if  I were going to start a company. But you all probably know what that is  much better than I do. Whatever your peers are doing, whatever peers are excited about,  even if it looks like a toy today ... Especially if it looks like a  toy today, that's probably the next great wave. But you want to identify this, what  is the big technological tectonic shift that's going to happen in the next couple of  years? Do something that's enabled by that and built on that platform.

如果我要开一家公司的话，这是现在最简单的上篮。但你们可能都知道那比我好得多。无论你的同龄人在做什么，不管你的同伴们对什么感到兴奋，即使它今天看起来像个玩具.特别是如果它今天看起来像个玩具，那可能是下一波巨浪。但是你想要找出这一点，在未来的几年里，将发生什么重大的技术结构变化？做一些能够在这个平台上建立起来的事情。

It's also easier  to start a hard company than an easy company. Most people, especially young people, want  to pick something that doesn't sound too ambitious, doesn't sound too hard. . Starting a  company sounds really hard.

创办一家艰难的公司也比创办一家简单的公司容易得多。大多数人，特别是年轻人，都想选择一些听起来不太雄心勃勃，听起来不太难的东西。。创办一家公司听起来很难。

I better pick the easiest possible company. But actually, starting a  company is always hard, and it's about equally hard not matter what you do.

我最好选择最简单的公司。但实际上，创办一家公司总是很困难的，不管你做什么，都是同样困难的事情。

If  you start a hard company, though, if you inspire passionate people, if you are building  like general AI or supersonic airplanes or nuclear power, you'll have a lot more people  who are excited about that than in another derivative idea. You know, Facebook, nineteen hundred  and fifty two. This idea that it's easier to start a hard company than an  easy company, I think is a big secret in startups still. But it's one that  I've seen again and again play out. As Dustin mentioned in answering a question, co-founders  are really good. But a bad co-founder is way worse than no co-founder. Because so  many people say you need a co-founder, there are a lot of people that will  pull some random person off the street and make her their co-founder. This is really  bad.

但是，如果你创办了一家艰难的公司，如果你激励热情的人，如果你在建造像普通人工智能、超音速飞机或核能这样的建筑，你会有更多的人对此感到兴奋，而不是其他衍生的想法。你知道，Facebook，1952年。我认为创办一家艰难的公司比一家简单的公司更容易，这对初创企业来说仍然是个大秘密。但这是我一次又一次看到的结果。正如达斯汀在回答一个问题时提到的，联合创始人真的很棒。但糟糕的联合创始人比没有联合创始人要糟糕得多。因为很多人说你需要一个联合创始人，所以有很多人会把一些随机的人从大街上拉出来，让她成为他们的共同创始人。这真的很糟糕。

In fact, we did a little analysis of our data at Y Combinator on  this once. And this glom don, random co-founders, a hundred percent failure rate. A hundred  percent. You really need a shared history. You want someone that you know is good,  you know you can work with, and that you have an obligation to. There are  many times in the course of the startup where the expected value dips below the  x axis, just temporarily. And it's not rational to keep going.

事实上，我们曾经在YCombinator上对我们的数据做了一些分析。而这个阴郁的，随机的联合创始人，百分之百的失败率。百分之百。你真的需要一个共享的历史。你想要一个你知道的人是好的，你知道你可以一起工作，而且你有义务这样做。在启动过程中，有很多次期望值下降到x轴以下，只是暂时的。继续下去是不合理的。

If you have a  shared history and a bond with someone, you keep going anyway because you don't want  to let your friend down. This is really important. You want to select with determination.  Determination is the most important value in a co-founder I've ever been able to identify.  It's not the thing people look for the most. Startups really, really hard. Determined people  are the ones that make it work. Startups are about not giving up. When we  talk to our best founders, the things that they say are things like, "I always  figure it out.

如果你有一个共同的历史和与某人的联系，你继续前进，因为你不想让你的朋友失望。这真的很重要。你要坚定地选择。在我所能确定的共同创始人中，决心是最重要的价值。这不是人们最想要的东西。创业公司真的非常努力。有决心的人才是成功的人。初创公司是关于不放弃的。当我们和最好的创始人交谈时，他们说的话是：“我总是想出办法。

I never give up." These are the traits that actually works.

我从不放弃。“这些才是真正有效的特质。

It's  not that picture that Dustin showed from the movie of like the beautiful writing equations  on the window.

这不是达斯汀从电影中看到的那张照片，就像窗户上美丽的书写方程式。

It's just dogged persistence. You keep going and it eventually works.

只是固执的坚持。你继续下去，它最终会起作用的。

It's  co-founders that need to have that. When I think about co-founders, I tell people to  think values first, aptitudes second, and specific skills third.

联合创始人需要这样做。当我想到联合创始人时，我告诉人们首先要考虑价值观，其次是能力，第三是具体的技能。

I think most people go in  the opposite order. They're like, I need a co-founder who knows JavaScript and X and  Y. Really, you want to find someone that matches your values, especially this value of  determination. You want someone just has a lot of potential and aptitude, and then finally  you can think about specific skills. Finally, you want someone who is humble and not  entitled. When someone asked Dustin the question about what has changed in startups from 2004  to 2017, my answer to that question is that there are more people than ever  before that want to get into startups for the wrong reasons. That want to do  it because it's the cool thing to do. These are the people that would have  gone into investment banking in 2004. You want people that are humble, that are not  entitled, that are willing to do whatever it takes. And they're doing this because they  want to create this thing. They have this idea that they can't let go. We  have five lectures in this course devoted to the product because a great product is  the single most important thing that you do. The one thing I want to mention  for now, as you are thinking about the product you build, is that it is  more important to have a small number of users that love you, than a lot  of users that like you. Almost all startups get this wrong. Eventually what you want,  of course, is a lot of users that really love your product. That's almost impossible  to do.

我想大多数人都是相反的。他们就像，我需要一个知道JavaScript、X和Y的联合创始人。真的，你想找到一个和你的价值观相匹配的人，尤其是这个决心的价值。你想要的人只是有很大的潜力和天资，最后你可以考虑具体的技能。最后，你想要的人是谦逊的，没有资格的。当有人问达斯汀关于初创企业从2004年到2017年发生了什么变化的问题时，我对这个问题的回答是，有更多的人想以错误的理由进入初创企业。因为这是一件很酷的事。这些人将在2004年进入投资银行业务。你想要的人是谦逊的，没有资格的，愿意做任何事情的人。他们这么做是因为他们想创造这个东西。他们有一个他们不能放手的想法。在这门课程中，我们有五节课专门讨论这个产品，因为一个伟大的产品是你所做的最重要的一件事。我现在想提到的一件事是，当你在考虑你生产的产品时，有一小部分喜欢你的用户比很多喜欢你的用户更重要。几乎所有的初创公司都错了。当然，最终你想要的是很多真正喜欢你的产品的用户。这几乎是不可能的。

In practice, you have two choices. You can go deep and narrow. You  can have a small number of users that really love you and then you can  find out how to find more and more of those users and broaden the appeal  of the product. Or, you can have a lot of people that kind of use  the product once or twice, kind of like it and try to figure out how  to get them more engaged overtime. With high confidence, I can say you want to  start with a small number of users that really love you. Almost all great companies  have products that start this way. Think about the ones in your own life. The  products that are so good that you spontaneously tell your friends about them. The products  that are so good that if they went away, you would write the company and  protest. That's what it means to really love a product. A good indicator of that  is retention and frequency of use.

实际上，你有两个选择。你可以走得又深又窄。你可以有一小部分真正爱你的用户，然后你就可以找到越来越多的用户，并扩大产品的吸引力。或者，你可以有很多人使用这种产品一两次，有点喜欢它，并试图找出如何让他们更多的投入加班。带着很高的自信，我可以说你想从一小部分真正爱你的用户开始。几乎所有伟大的公司都有这样的产品。想想你生活中的那些。这些产品是如此的好，以至于你会自发地告诉你的朋友关于它们的事情。产品是如此好，如果他们离开，你会写信给公司和抗议。这就是真正爱一个产品的意思。这方面的一个很好的指标是保留和使用频率。

In fact, I think this is so important that  you shouldn't track absolute growth and number of users in the early days of a  startup. You should just track how often they're using it. We'll have a session on  metrics later, but you really want to get good at analyzing your metrics and saying,  "Is this a user that I'm retaining and that's using it frequently? How do I  compare to other products in my space?" That's a good early indicator of users that  love you. Better still is them spontaneously telling your friends to buy your product. The  important point here is this, nothing but a great product will save you. We're going  to talk about a lot other things in this course, and they all kind of  matter, but if you don't get this one right ...

事实上，我认为这是非常重要的，所以你不应该跟踪创业初期的绝对增长和用户数量。你应该跟踪他们多久用一次。稍后我们将讨论度量标准，但您确实希望能够更好地分析您的度量标准，并说：“这是我保留的用户吗？它经常使用吗？我如何与我的空间中的其他产品进行比较？”这是一个很好的早期指标，用户谁爱你。更好的是，他们主动告诉你的朋友购买你的产品。这里最重要的一点是，只有一个伟大的产品才能拯救你。我们会在这门课上讨论很多其他的事情，它们都很重要，但是如果你不把这件事做好.

If you don't make a  great product, the thing is still not going to work. You need to get some  users to build a great product. You can't do this in a vacuum. You need  people to talk to and to iterate with. You need to find a small number  of users that will help you build this great product. One of the most common  cliches in all of startup advice is the talk show users. One thing I've learned  is that most people don't know what that actually means. Most people will say, "Oh,  I'm supposed to talk to my users." So, they call up a user and say,  "Hey, it's Sam. Do you like my product?" And the user says, "Yeah, I do,  it's fine." People kind of generally don't want to disappoint you. So you say, "Oh  great, thanks", and you hang up the phone. This is what most founders do when  you say, talk to your users. This is not what it means. Emmet Shear, who  is one of our lecturers later, is really good at doing user interviews. He'll talk  about this in more detail. But you really need to drill in and remember people  are going to be too nice to you. You need to find out exactly what  they like about it. And you need to watch them use it. You need to  try to figure out where they're doing things that seem weird to you because they're  trying to accomplish something else. You should ask them, "Have you recommended this to anyone  else? If not, why not? Have you paid me yet? If not, why not? What  would that take?" You really have to dig in and talk about specific features, things  they used to use instead, times when they stopped using your product and used some  other product. The top level questions here don't help you.

如果你不做一个伟大的产品，这件事仍然是行不通的。您需要一些用户来构建一个伟大的产品。你不能在真空里这样做。你需要和别人交谈和反复交流。您需要找到少量的用户来帮助您构建这一伟大的产品。在所有的创业建议中，最常见的陈词滥调之一就是脱口秀用户。我学到的一件事是，大多数人不知道这到底意味着什么。大多数人会说，“哦，我应该和我的用户谈谈。”于是，他们打电话给一个用户说：“嘿，我是山姆，你喜欢我的产品吗？”用户说，“是的，我知道，没关系。”人们一般都不想让你失望。所以你说，“哦，太好了，谢谢”，然后你就挂断了电话。这是大多数创始人在你和你的用户交谈时所做的事情。这不是它的意思。埃米特·谢尔后来是我们的讲师之一，他非常擅长做用户访谈。他会更详细地讨论这件事。但你真的需要钻研，记住人们会对你太好了。你得弄清楚他们到底喜欢什么。你需要看着他们使用它。你需要试着找出他们在哪里做一些你觉得奇怪的事情，因为他们在努力完成其他的事情。你应该问他们，“你向其他人推荐过这个吗？如果没有，为什么不？你付过我钱了吗？如果没有，为什么不？这需要什么？”你真的必须深入讨论特定的特性，他们曾经用过的东西，当他们停止使用你的产品和使用其他产品的时候。这里最高级的问题帮不了你。

In terms of getting those  users, everyone thinks that they're just going to put up this website, tell one person  about it, and it's going take off like wildfire. That's not what usually happens. There  are four common strategies to get your first hundred users.

在吸引这些用户方面，每个人都认为他们只是想贴上这个网站，告诉一个人，它会像野火一样火爆。这不是通常发生的事。有四种常见的策略可以让你的头100个用户。

I'm going to go through  them in roughly best to worst. You can email people you already know and you  can ask them to be your customers. You can call in all the favors with  anyone you can think of, someone you took a random class with, someone you were  friends with in high school.

我要把它们看得最好到最坏。你可以发电子邮件给你已经认识的人，你可以让他们成为你的客户。你可以找所有你能想到的人帮忙，随便跟你一起上课的人，高中时你是朋友的人。

If it's a paid product, you should actually charge. This  is important. Remember, people are going to be inclined to do you favors. They are  going to be too nice in what they tell you. So, if it's a paid  product, charge them. Another strategy is to research people that you think might use your  product, and then email them or whatever and ask them to try it. Conversions rate  here are low, maybe two, three percent. So you'll have to do this a ton  more. But you can send targeted emails and say, "Hey, I just made this new  product.

如果是付费产品，你应该收费。这很重要。记住，人们会倾向于帮助你。他们对你说的话太好了。所以，如果是付费产品，就向他们收费。另一种策略是研究你认为可能使用你的产品的人，然后给他们发电子邮件或者其他什么，然后让他们试一试。这里的转换率很低，可能是2%，3%。所以你得多做一件事。但是你可以发送有针对性的电子邮件，说：“嘿，我刚做了这个新产品。

I'd really appreciate it if you would try it out." Most people want to  be helpful. They probably will. You can do social media, hacker news, forums, press, whatever.  If this is going to be your growth strategy, you need to figure out a  way for it to be ongoing. Not a one big pop and then go away.  Most people who do this find that it works once, then they call up the  journalists and say, "Will you write about me again?" And the journalist will say, "Has  anything changed?" "No, but I really need users. Will you please write?" The journalist still  says no. Airbnb is an example of a company that made this work as an  ongoing process. They would do the craziest things. They just kept coming up with press  stunt after press stunt. They would mail journalists giant boxes of cereal, so they got  on their desks. They were able to get it to keep going. But that's hard.  Finally, the laziest and least impressive thing you can do is to just buy ads  on Facebook or Google and point people to your website. This is not what I  recommend.

如果你能试试看的话，我会非常感激的。“大多数人都想帮忙。他们可能会的。你可以做社交媒体，黑客新闻，论坛，媒体等等。如果这将是你的增长战略，你需要想出一个方法让它持续下去。不是一个大流行然后就走了。大多数这样做的人发现它曾经起过作用，然后他们打电话给记者，说：“你会再写我吗？”记者会说，“有什么变化吗？”“没有，但我真的需要用户。请你写信好吗？“记者仍然拒绝。Airbnb是一家将这项工作作为一个持续过程的公司的一个例子。他们会做最疯狂的事。他们只是不断地想出一个又一个的新闻特技。他们会寄给记者一大盒麦片，于是他们就站在桌子上。他们能让它继续前进。但这很难。最后，你能做的最懒惰和最令人印象最深刻的事情就是在Facebook或Google上购买广告，并将人们指向你的网站。这不是我推荐的。

I don't know of any startup that's gotten a big start in this way.  I include it because it's the idea that most people try.

我不知道有哪个创业公司是以这种方式起步的。我把它包括在内，因为这是大多数人都在尝试的想法。

I want to wrap  this up before I take a few questions by talking about building a great company.  We talked about this earlier, getting to know your users really well is important. The  best founders, they do customer support themselves. They go visit their users. They sit in  their office if they can.

在我回答几个问题之前，我想先总结一下建立一家伟大的公司的问题。我们之前讨论过这个问题，了解您的用户非常重要。最好的创始人，他们做客户支持自己。他们去拜访他们的用户。如果可以的话，他们就坐在办公室里。

In the case of Airbnb, they'd go live with them.  You want to get to know your users really, really well. They have a short  cycle time. The cycle here is basically like, talk to customer, understand pain point, build  product to address that, get that in front of a user, ask them, see what  they do, and then repeat the cycle. This cycle is how you iterate and improve.  The law of compound growth being what it is, if you can get two percent  better every iteration cycle, and you have a chance of having iteration cycle be every  four hours or every four weeks, and you compound it over the course of a  few years, you get in very, very different places. Make it one of your top  goals to build the fastest iterating company the world has ever seen. You want to  make a long term commitment. Most companies don't do this. Most companies, especially if they're  trying to start the easy company, think in a two or three year time frame.  These things always just take a lot longer.

在Airbnb的情况下，他们会和他们住在一起。你想非常的了解你的用户。他们的周期很短。这里的循环基本上是这样的，与客户交谈，理解痛点，构建产品来解决这个问题，在用户面前得到它，询问他们，看看他们做了什么，然后重复这个循环。这个循环是您如何迭代和改进的。复合增长的规律是这样的，如果你能在每一个迭代周期中得到2%的好处，并且你有机会每4小时或每4周进行一次迭代，那么在几年的时间里，你就会得到完全不同的结果。把创建世界上最快的迭代公司作为你的首要目标之一。你想做一个长期的承诺。大多数公司都不这么做。大多数公司，特别是当他们试图创建一家简单的公司时，都会在两三年的时间内思考。这些东西总是要花更长的时间。

It's always somehow almost a ten year  project if it's going to work.

如果要成功的话，这几乎是一个十年的工程。

If you think about it that way from the  very beginning, you will make very different and much better decisions.

如果你从一开始就这样想的话，你会做出非常不同和更好的决定。

I think this is  the only arbitrage opportunity left in the market. Almost no one makes a very long  term commitment to the new project.

我认为这是市场上唯一的套利机会。几乎没有人对新项目作出非常长期的承诺。

If you do that, you will think in a  different way. You will hire different people, and that will work really well. Speaking of  hiring, stay lean until everything is working really well.

如果你这样做，你会以不同的方式思考。你会雇佣不同的人，这会很好。说到招聘，保持精干直到一切都很顺利。

I think this is somewhat bimodal.  In the early days when you're experimenting and zigzagging and you want to be like  a fast little speedboat, and you want to be able to turn the whole company  on a dime ... And you can't do that if you have a big company.  Cash burn aside, which is another problem, the flexibility of a company basically decreases with  the square of the number of employees. You want to stay really small until you're  sure things are working. When things are working, then you can get really big.

我觉得这有点像双峰。在最初的日子里，当你在试验和曲折，你想成为一个快速的小快艇，你想要能够使整个公司在一分钱.。如果你有一家大公司你就不能这么做。除了现金消耗，这是另一个问题，公司的灵活性基本上随着员工数量的平方而减少。在你确定一切正常之前，你想要保持很小的规模。当事情进展顺利的时候，你就会变得很大。

In  fact, then you need to. Once you switch into hyper scale mode, you want to  just get as fast as you can with great people. Because then, you don't want  to be a speedboat, you want to be an aircraft carrier. You want to be  a battleship. And you don't care about the fact that you can't turn as fast.  You just want to steamroll everything. You really want to be in one mode or  the other. You'll know, like once users are just begging for your product, you'll be  convinced you have great product, market fit. That is when you can start to scale  up the company. Even when you get there, though, resist the urge to hire mediocre  people. , who's speaking later in the course, has a saying that I love which  is, the team you build is the company you build. This is really true.

事实上，那你就需要。一旦你切换到高比例模式，你想要尽快与伟大的人。因为那样的话，你不想成为快艇，你想成为一艘航空母舰。你想成为一艘战舰。你也不关心这样一个事实，那就是你不能那么快地转身。你只是想掩盖一切。你真的想在一种或另一种模式下。你会知道，就像一旦用户只是乞求你的产品，你会相信你有伟大的产品，市场适合。那就是你开始扩大公司规模的时候了。即使你到了那里，也要抵制雇用平庸的人的冲动。在课程的后面，有句话说我喜欢，你建立的团队就是你建立的公司。这是真的。

I  didn't appreciate how true this was for a long time.

很长一段时间以来我都不知道这是真的。

If you build a team  of great people and you have a product people love, you have a ninety something  percent chance of success. Those are really hard to do and there are independent variables,  but don't ignore the team. The best CEOs I know spend huge amounts of their  time recruiting and retaining their talent. How much of your time would you say you  spend on this?
Dustin M: Forty or fifty percent.

如果你建立了一个伟大的团队，并且你拥有一个人们喜欢的产品，你就有90%的成功机会。这些都是很难做到的，也有自变量，但是不要忽视团队。我认识的最好的CEO会花费大量的时间来招募和留住他们的人才。你说你在这上面花了多少时间？达斯汀·M：百分之四十或百分之五十。

Sam Altman: This is Dustin Moskovitz, doesn't need to do anything he doesn't want to do and  he chooses to spend half of his time recruiting and retaining employees.

山姆·奥特曼：这位是达斯汀·莫斯科维茨，他不需要做任何他不想做的事情，他选择花一半的时间来招募和留住员工。

If Dustin can  do that, you all should probably really be doing that as well. Every CEO I've  met has an excuse for why they only spend five percent of their time on  building their team.

如果达斯汀能做到的话，你们可能也应该这么做。我见过的每一位CEO都有理由解释为什么他们只花了5%的时间来建设自己的团队。

It always sounds really good and then they always turn out to  fail. Really, really invest in this. Relentless execution. This is a theme we'll talk about  a lot. But you have to keep going and keep going and keep going. And  you have to do things perfectly. And you have to get all the details right.  You have to care too much about every experience that a customer has with your  company. There's this book, The Score Takes Care of Itself, something like that, read it.  It's really good.

这听起来总是很好，然后他们总是失败。真的，真的要在这上面投资。无情的处决。这是我们要讨论的主题。但你必须继续前进。你必须把事情做得很完美。你必须把所有的细节都弄清楚。你必须太在意客户在你公司的每一次经历。有一本书，乐谱会照顾到自己，类似的东西，读吧。真的很好。

It's about how important it is to get all the details right  and just move forward relentlessly and as quickly as you can. Startups are about not  giving up to a degree that most people don't have a good intuitive understanding for.  One of the very best companies in the last YC batch, he applied seven times  before he got in. Most people, you reject them six times, they're not going to  apply on the seventh. This is just a version of what happens in startups all  the time where you get beat down again and again and again.

重要的是要把所有的细节都弄清楚，并且尽可能快地坚持不懈地向前迈进。创业是指不放弃大多数人没有很好的直觉理解的程度。作为上一批YC中最优秀的公司之一，他在进入YC之前申请了七次。大多数人，你拒绝他们六次，他们不会在第七次申请。这只是一个版本，在创业公司发生的一切，当你一次又一次被击败。

It's like that  last time when you get pushed down and you don't think you have enough energy  to get back up ... That's when it finally works. This is what you sign  up for if you're going to start a startup. Remember, if this is like a  10 year marathon, you have a fiduciary duty to your shareholders to take care of  yourself. Some people treat a startup as an all nighter. They don't do a good  job taking care of their health. They don't sleep. They don't maintain their personal relationships.  It is true that startups are a bad choice for a work life balance. There  are always these posts about how I changed the world with my startup only working  two hours a day and you know, kite surfing the rest of the time. Somehow,  these people, though, are never the ones that actually make a big impact. They just  talk a lot. Startups are really hard. You have a duty to yourself, your team,  your investors, to take care of yourself and to not neglect your health, your wellbeing,  the rest of you ... Your life, your personal relationships. And then finally, a clear  mission. You don't have to figure this out on day one. But all of the  most successful startups I've been fortunate enough to be a part of, pretty quickly ...  First year or two years at the outside, they figure out a really important mission.  It is this mission that gets you to join them, that drives them, that drives  the founders. They get the media to write about them. And even if you start  off building a project that's just interesting to you and solves a problem in your  own life, which is how you should start. Remember to, at some point, have a  clear mission. You have to become a great evangelist for this mission. One other skill  that didn't make it into this version of the deck is being a great communicator.  You need to clearly communicate, clearly think, this clear mission. That is what will convince  people to come help you. That is how you will build this idea into this  giant set of ... This huge company and all these people that really love your  product. All right.

上一次当你被推倒的时候，你觉得自己没有足够的精力重新站起来.那时候它终于起作用了。如果你要创业，这就是你注册的目的。记住，如果这是一个10年的马拉松，你有一个信托责任，你的股东照顾自己。有些人把创业当作通宵。他们没有很好地照顾自己的健康。他们不睡觉。他们不维持私人关系。的确，创业对于平衡工作生活来说是个糟糕的选择。总有一些关于我如何改变世界的帖子，我的创业公司每天只工作两个小时，你知道的，风筝冲浪在剩下的时间里。然而，不知怎么的，这些人从来都不是那些真正产生重大影响的人。他们只是说了很多。创业真的很难。你对你自己，你的团队，你的投资者，照顾好自己，不忽视你的健康，你的其他人，都有责任.你的生活你的私人关系。最后一个明确的任务。你不必在第一天就想清楚。但我有幸加入的所有最成功的创业公司.在外面工作的第一年或两年，他们发现了一个非常重要的任务。正是这个使命让你加入了他们，推动了创始人。他们让媒体来报道他们。即使你开始建立一个你感兴趣的项目，并且解决你自己生活中的一个问题，这也是你应该如何开始的。记住，在某一时刻，要有一个明确的使命。你必须成为这一使命的伟大传道者。另一个没有进入这个版本甲板的技能是成为一个伟大的沟通者。你需要清楚地沟通，清楚地思考，这个明确的使命。这就是说服人们来帮助你的原因。这就是你要把这个想法构建成一组巨大的.这个大公司和所有那些真正喜欢你的产品的人。好的

I talked a little longer than I was hoping to.

我说的时间比我希望的要长一些。

I've got  about two minutes left for questions if anyone has one.

如果有人有问题的话，我还有两分钟的时间。

Speaker 10: I was wondering like if there are two people you can hire. One person is  like a very passionate about like the things you were building, but lacks all the  skill you need. The other person is really, really good at things that you're not  good at, but they're not really passionate about your idea. Which one would you
Sam Altman: So you have a choice to hire people. One is passionate and value aligned, but  not a good skills match. The other one is a great skills match, but not  passionate. Values first, aptitude second, specific skills third.

演讲者10：我在想，如果有两个人你可以雇佣。一个人就像一个充满激情的人，就像你正在建造的东西，但却缺乏你所需要的所有技能。另一个人非常，非常擅长你不擅长的事情，但他们对你的想法并没有真正的热情。山姆·奥特曼：那么你可以选择雇佣一些人。一个是热情和价值一致的，但不是一个很好的技能匹配。另一个是一个伟大的技能匹配，但不是激情。价值观第一，能力第二，技能第三。

If you can get a really smart  person who really shares your values and your mission and believes in what you're doing,  they can learn the skills. This is a framework that has not let me down  many times.

如果你能找到一个非常聪明的人，他能真正分享你的价值观和使命，并相信你在做什么，他们就能学到这些技能。这是一个没有多少次让我失望的框架。

Speaker 11: How do you get good at getting good ideas?
Sam Altman: How do you get good at getting good ideas? One thing is just to practice  a lot and tell people your ideas. And be willing for them to tell you  why it's terrible.

演讲者11：你如何才能获得好的想法？山姆·阿尔特曼：你是如何获得好主意的？一件事就是多练习，告诉别人你的想法。让他们告诉你为什么这很可怕。

I think good ideas are not a solo endeavor. You want to  find a group of smart people that you can start bouncing things off of and  say, "Hey, I noticed this thing and it kind of sucked. What can we do  about it?" You don't just sit in the room and write on the window with  the whiteboard pen and have ideas come to you. Good ideas come because you talk  to people. You have smart friends, you have colleagues and you spitball ideas around.

我认为好的想法不是一个人的努力。你想找一群聪明的人，你可以开始跳起来，然后说：“嘿，我注意到了这件事，它有点烂。我们能做些什么呢？”你不只是坐在房间里，用白板笔在窗户上写字，想出主意来。好主意之所以出现是因为你和人交谈。你有聪明的朋友，你有同事，你到处胡说八道。

I  would say notice problems in your life, even if you don't have a solution, still  talk just about the problem and see if you can come up with something. This  is ... One more thing on that.

我想说的是，注意你生活中的问题，即使你没有解决办法，你还是要谈论这个问题，看看你能不能想出点什么来。这是.。还有一件事。

Ideas are very fragile. When you find this  set of people to start talking about ideas with, you want people that don't immediately  shoot at bad, half-baked, half-formed idea down. You want people who will say, "Well, yes  ... What if we do this other thing?" You don't want people who are like,  "That sounds stupid." You want people who will say, "Well, that sounds crazy and unlikely  to work, but think about how big it could be if it did work." That's  the spirit of the kind of person. And then how can we figure out how  to make it work that you want? But, I'd say notice problems, have people to  talk with. Anything you'd add to that? All right. We can do one more question.

思想是非常脆弱的。当你发现这一组人开始谈论想法的时候，你想要的是那些不会立即对坏的，半生不熟的，半形成的想法开枪的人。你想让人说：“好吧，是的.如果我们做另外一件事呢？”你不想让那些“听起来很蠢”的人。你想要的人会说，“这听起来很疯狂，也不太可能奏效，但是想想，如果它能成功的话，它会有多大。”这就是那种人的精神。然后我们怎么才能找到你想要的效果呢？但是，我想说的是，注意到问题，有人可以交谈。你还想再加点什么吗？好的我们可以再问一个问题。

Speaker 12: This revolves around fund raising. How do you know when to start fund raising?
Sam Altman: How do you know when to start fund raising? We're going to have a whole  class on that. But in general, if you can raise money, and it's easy ...  So if people are desperate to give you money on good terms, that might be  a good time to take it. The other one, of course, is if you need  the money. And then you kind of may need to do it no matter what  the terms are.

演讲者12：这是围绕筹资。你怎么知道什么时候开始筹款？山姆·奥特曼：你怎么知道什么时候开始筹款？我们会有一整堂课的。但总的来说，如果你能筹到钱，这很容易.因此，如果人们迫切希望以良好的条件给你钱，那也许是一个很好的时机。另一个当然是如果你需要钱的话。不管条件是什么，你都可能需要这样做。

In general, you want to have progress to warrant the funding you  need.

一般来说，你想要有进展来保证你所需要的资金。

It's kind of when you have enough progress, then you're able to fairly easily  raise money and you need it, that's the best of all possible times. But again,  that's a complicated question. We'll do a full lecture on it. All right, one more.

这是一种当你有足够的进展，然后你能够相当容易地筹集资金，你需要它，这是最好的时间。但同样，这是一个复杂的问题。我们将就此做一次完整的讲座。好吧，再来一次。

Speaker 13: How do you decide when to turn from the searching mode and
Sam Altman: How do you decide to switch from when you're kind of like hacking around trying  to get good product market fit and when to really scale up the company? You  will know. Everyone wonders how they know when it's time for that.

演讲者13：你如何决定什么时候该从搜索模式转向，山姆·奥特曼：你是如何决定从什么时候开始转变的，就像你在试图获得良好的产品市场，以及何时真正扩大公司规模？你会知道的。每个人都想知道什么时候该这么做了。

It's like when  you are running around the office 80 hours a week, pulling your hairs out, and  people love your product so much you just can't build it fast enough ... That's  when.

就像你每周在办公室里跑80个小时，把头发拔出来，人们非常喜欢你的产品，你就是不能很快地把它做好。就是那个时候。

I have never seen someone not be able to figure out when this moment  is. All right. On Thursday, we will have a session on startup mechanics. And thank  you very much.


我从来没见过有人不知道这一刻是什么时候。好的周四，我们将有一个关于启动机制的会议。非常感谢。
