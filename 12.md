# How to Think About PR - Sharon Pope

Sharon: Okay. Hi everyone. We're going to talk about public relations today. I'm Sharon. I actually  work at Y Combinator and I work on our continuity team, which is the team  that does growth-stage investing, so Series B, Series C investing, and also trying to create  programs and give advice to founders as they enter into a different phase of their  startup. Right after they've built a great product, they have to then go build a  company and make it a really great company, so that's what we try to help  with on the continuity team. Before I was at YC, I was the chief marketing  officer at Green Dot, which is a fintech company, makes prepaid debit cards and checking  accounts that don't let you overdraft, so really targeting an underbanked population. It's a public  company, and I got there by being acquired ... I was at Loopt, which is  a startup, is actually a Sam Altman startup. I worked with Sam there for two  years, and before that I was at PR agencies. I was at two different PR  agencies, probably had a total of 20 clients over that period of time, ranging from  startups to big companies like Intel. I've done a lot of on-the-ground PR work and  also have thought about it from a strategic level, and also get to talk to  founders from YC everyday about PR and marketing. That's why I'm here talking to you,  and the tough thing is ... Even though this is going to be about PR,  you're not going to escape the standard YC advice, which is while PR might be  interesting and something that could help in some ways for your business, your number one  job as a founder is to focus on your product. You're not going to escape  that. So even if PR is interesting, that's the key goal. I bring it up  because without product innovation, PR is not going to be an option for you. This  startup curve is the one that Paul Graham drew way back, it probably looks familiar.  The fact is you could get some great article written about your product, but if  you get people in there and they're disenchanted by it or not impressed, they're not  going to come back, so you're not going to have something that's ongoing that you  can really depend on. It's not a customer acquisition channel. If press motivates you, if  being on the cover of WIRED is something that you think will be cool, that's  cool, have that motivate you and create a product that press cannot ignore, right? That's  how you get great PR results, is creating an amazing product. So, that's the first  thing you can do. Now that's said, you know that's your first job, but there  are some things ... I am going to actually give you some tangible tools and  steps that you can take to start a PR program. My first tip though for  early-stage founders is don't go and hire a PR agency or PR person. I really  believe for early-stage founders that founder-led PR is simply the only way to go, for  a lot of reasons, but mainly I think it's actually special. Reporters like hearing from  founders, that's the end spokesperson for them. So there's not someone going in between, there's  someone who they genuinely can learn from and gather information from, knocking right on their  door ... I guess usually in this forum, an email ... But you're getting exposure  to someone who could actually be a spokesperson for you. So it's special, and it's  something that's kind of unique to the vibe that you can pull off when you're  at a early stage. And the other side is you have something to offer. You  may pitch some reporter today and might not fit into their coverage for the day  or for the week, but in a month something relevant to that area could happen,  and they'll call you because you're a subject matter expert, you know your domain, you  know your business, and that helps them craft a story, that helps them give background  to a story. I would kind of think about it as not a switch you  can flip from a PR perspective, but really you're trying to establish a relationship and  trying to just get the ball rolling getting your company name out there, your product  out there, and just establishing yourself as an incredible spokesperson. This is the next question  I always get when I say that first speech, so I just really want to  take a second to just knock down these myths. I even sent out some questions  to a lot of folks in startup school, and I got some of these questions  back about PR agencies. First reason why people might think that they really, really need  a PR person to come in right away and help them, that they might help  define the business and de-jargonize it. Yes, communications folks can be really good at that,  but you're kind of depriving yourself of a process that's going to be really useful  beyond media relations. Being able to define your business in a clear and concise way  is going to pay back in every aspect of your business. When you're talking to  a potential investor, when you're talking to a potential partner, when you're trying to hire  your first few engineers, you need to able to clearly pitch them on what makes  your business special and why they should listen to you. So, don't deprive yourself of  that process. They come up with story angles, right, so they're paying attention to the  news. Well, you're a better spokesperson and founder if you follow the news. You need  to understand where your business sits in the news. I'm not saying you should spend  five hours a day poring over every news site, but you should have a good  pulse, couple times a day, check in and look at the stories that are relevant  to your business and just more broadly understand where your business fits in the world.  The third reason, and the most common reason I get, is that they know the  reporters, they hold these relationships, they are the ones that make it happen. I'll tell  you no credible reporter would ever write a story because they went to drinks with  someone. They'll write a story because it's a good story, right, so a story always  trumps a relationship. Focus on that, focus on a product that has a story, focus  on a product that has traction, which is a story, and that's what can pull  ... That's what can start creating those relationships for you. It's not a magic kind  of key that you can turn. They field media inquiries, so they'll be able to  respond to press in a timely manner. It's a pretty high-class problem to have. If  you're getting tons of media inquiries that you're drowning in them, you probably have some  pretty good product traction and maybe you're having a blazing success, and then you have  permission to hire a strategic communications partner who can help you through that. And lastly,  they're good at sending invoices. Not to minimize that to a PR agency or a  PR professional, but this is ... It's essentially overhead in a lot of ways because  there's no guaranteed results. An agency can come in, they don't know your business, they  have to learn your business, so probably about a month out. And then they start  pitching, it might be two weeks out, three weeks out, two months before you even  get a story in the news. Even then, that's not guaranteed to drive specific business  goal because it's not an engaged, measurable customer acquisition tactic. Get to a place where  you have a really good team that can build that great product, your engineering team,  your product team, yourself, and that's what you should focus on. So, hopefully I've convinced  you. But I do think that there are some simple things the founders can do  to chip away at the PR goals themselves. And eventually once you are a success,  you should hire a PR firm. They're cool, I used to work at one. Okay.  So, five steps, and these are really based on my experience. But I'm also weaving  in some common YC advice that the batches receive when they come through YC, specifically  this one: Who are you? This long list is the checklist of a whiteboarding session  at Y Combinator. Companies that come through YC will get this great presentation by Kat  Manalac who's a partner at YC, and then they'll meet with their group partners and  go through each of these questions. This is something that I implore you to take  time and think about. Invite a family member or a friend in, someone who's not  steeped in your world who can actually kind of give you some real advice on  whether or not your description is jargon or makes sense to the common man in  Anytown, USA, but most importantly what does your company do. We'll talk about that more.  Being able to describe your customer, so how does your product live through your customer,  through the lens of their customer. People like stories about people, so this is a  great one for PR. What problem are you solving, and how are you measuring how  you're growing, and how are you growing? Who are your competitors, and why are you  better than your competitors? What are your plans for next year? And I think one  of the more important ones for PR as well is why you? Why did you  start this company? Why are you uniquely qualified to bring this product to the world?  And that can range from stories of something you overcame that caused you to explore  this field and to conquer this technology and this innovation, or it could be that  you came from a company that has done this kind of, and you broke off  and are doing it better. So, the founder stories are really great to establish early  on because sometimes we can forget that about ourselves, that we bring something special to  the table. To dive a little bit deeper on the "What does your company do?"  The biggest advice is to lead with the what, not the why. And what I  mean by that is even though we've established that you're all cool founders and that  you're uniquely qualified to start your business, that's kind of a long story to get  all at once. Instead of some big paragraph where I have to really try to  navigate and understand what your company actually is, it's a lot easier for you to  say to me, "Well, is Boeing for electric airplanes." I get that. You're making them,  they're electric. Tell me more, I want to lean in, I want to hear more  ... Actual company from the last batch of YC by the way. Dropbox, it synchronizes  your files across your and your team's computers. That's easy to understand. It might seem  silly now, but this was actually their description on their YC application years and years  ago. The overall summary here is make it conversational, which means no jargon, no preamble,  just get right to it. And above all, make it concise. Step two, we're going  to define your goals and your audience. And this one ... It's kind of a  first principles type process because PR actually isn't a goal, so saying my goal is  to get a lot of press, it actually isn't your goal. If you really, really  step back, you're actually striving towards a business goal, so you want to maybe recruit  the best talent, you want to finance your growth, drive trial, land strategic partners. You  have things that you're trying to do with your business, so you want to ask  yourself this is the business thing I want to do, is there an audience that  I can maybe influence to help me get there? Press aren't the audience. They have  readers though, so press might be the window to your audience. Getting a story placed  or working with press to get some story placed could be a way to reach  this priority audience. If your priority or your business goal is to finance growth, your  audience might be investors, right? So that's kind of how you need to break it  down and really try to prioritize it, because if everything is a priority, then nothing's  a priority. So, really try to focus in. If your goal of press is investors,  it's actually going to influence the reporters that you try to talk to and the  publications that you try to get in. The other piece of YC advice, that I'm  sure you're already all doing, is building your product and talking to customers and repeat,  repeat, repeat. If you're talking to your customers anyway, maybe ask them what they read,  and that's a good way to kind of get to what outlets you might want  to consider thinking to get in. Which brings us to out next step, step three,  reading, which might seem common sense, but ... If you already read the news, probably  you already do, it's just maybe putting a little bit more structure around how you  look at the news. If you read a really compelling article that you feel like  hits some of the notes, that you as a founder represent or that your product  speaks to, then look at who wrote it. That person maybe will be interested in  a story about you and your company. The big tips here as you kind of  prepare ... I get a lot of questions from founders on how to bring efficiency  to this. The real answer is there's not tons of efficiency in this, this is  about relationship building. There's not something that can automate it. But here's some tools, a  google spreadsheet. That's the biggest tool I think people might use for PR, so just  kind of organizing your thoughts. You read a great article, grab the link, note who  wrote it and write a little bit to yourself about what was relevant and how  you think your story might play with that same reporter, given their interest and given  the coverage area. Think about what angle might interest them, which we'll talk a little  bit more about, and then think about connections to them. So we talked about how  PR agencies aren't vital for relationships, but it is nice to get a warm introduction  to a reporter. If you see that that reporter has written about someone you know,  an investor might know them, so maybe another founder has appeared in the story. You  might reach out to that founder, draft an email up for them and say, "Hey,  would you mind introducing me to this reporter. I think they might be interested in  my product." So, that's the connections to them column. On angle, I kind of wanted  to specifically point out business press because for an early-stage startup it's not always a  relevant target for people because ... I'm going to do an audience question now. What  would you guess is the most common topic covered in business outlets?
Participant 1: Funding.
Sharon: Maybe, yes. For startups, yes, but the most covered topic is business. You have to  have something that ties to market-moving, commerce, the economy. Funding is a good example for  where a startup might get into this. Another example where a startup might be able  to get a story in the business press would be if you're really getting a  lot of traction and upsetting the stream of someone else's business, so you're taking advertising  dollars away from Facebook, or you have an app that can hail a car and  it's maybe disrupting a taxi business. These are the things that will get you into  business press even before you get really big because you're showing signs of disruption, you're  showing signs that there's something to look at here. So, I wanted to kind of  cover that one because it's a common question. The other element ... As you start  reaching out to reporters, and I'll give you examples of pitches that have actually gone  out. Just a reminder that everything you say is on the record. The reporter's job  is to get the story, and they just start gathering all the information you give  them. If you share metrics of your business, they may write about them. It's the  common advice we give YC companies before Demo Day 2, when they're really excited to  share everything about their business and they share all their metrics, and they might be  surprised the next day when an article talks about the metrics of their business. It  might seem like common sense advice, but it's really easy to forget in the moment.  Just keep in mind, be open, be transparent, share honestly, but if you don't want  your metrics in the news, don't share them. Okay, what to say and timed outreach.  You're going to start reaching out. You have already looked at your year ahead and  thought about what news you might have. Maybe it's your actual company launch, maybe it's  a product launch. Maybe you have fundraising, maybe you got some investment. You might hit  some milestones, maybe you have some statistics that are cool. These are all examples of  company-fueled news. The other type of news is trend-based news, so how your company fits  in a bigger trend. It's things like a roundup of new finance apps, and maybe  you're going to be one of those apps that's named. I usually say that journalists  will usually only name three. They're not going to spend their day listing an exhaustive  list of all the 15, 20, 30 apps that exist. To the degree that you  have engaged with the reporter in a meaningful way, it may be that they don't  write about your news story one week, but maybe three weeks from now they're going  to do a round up and you'll be in it. So, there are some things  where just the relationship and just reaching out is good and can kind of pay  back later. Also politics, entertainment. When that kind of news happens, sometimes there's an opportunity  to jump on and be included in some way. And also contextualizing other company announcements.  If Apple has big developer news, then maybe your developer have something to say or  contribute, so reaching out and saying, "Hey, here's what I think about it. Let me  know if you want to talk." That can be a way to get your company  into the conversation. So, here's an actual example. Simple Habit was in YC's last batch,  and it's essentially Spotify for meditation. Yunha, the founder, specifically wanted to get coverage in  Engadget, so she found this reporter, Nathan ... He wrote several times about different streaming  apps and was specifically in new kinds of content, so he's written about Spotify, written  about YouTube TV. And so she approached him. She had some seed funding to announce.  Engadget doesn't actually write that much about fundraising and she knew that, so she reached  out, shared the fundraising news, but also shared that they were going to be doing  a new release that had a bunch more content coming out and a few new  features, and he was interested. He asked for more information, she shared some visuals, and  this is the story. So, that's a great example of something that Simple Habit did,  relevant pitch to the right reporter around news item. Here's another example. This is not  company-milestone based, but actually customer based. We talked about showing your product through the eyes  of the customer. This, YC company again, Thunkable, which lets anybody build mobile apps without  knowing how to code, they discovered this customer they had in Yemen who, again, without  knowing how to code, developed a solar app, or basically an app that brought thousands  of people solar power that had lost power due to civil war in Yemen. It's  a pretty cool story, right? They drafted up a pitch. They knew someone who knew  the reporter ... The founder knew someone who knew the reporter ... And drafted up  an email for that person to then send to a reporter at Fast Company. This  is the email asking if they can intro, giving a little bit of context, giving  that really short business description, and the reporter was interested. This is the story in  Fast Company. And here's an example of riding the news waves. We talked about politics  and entertainment possibly being something to jump on. It's not everyday that this is an  opportunity, so this is not your common example. We all might remember last October there  was some tapes that were leaked of Donald Trump saying lewd things on a bus,  and it was, to put it mildly, major news in the US, probably around the  world. This happened on October 8th I think. Deepgram, another YC company, their product is  basically search for speech, so they can search audio files like Google searches images. And  so they saw an opportunity with all this talk about are there more tapes, is  there anything else to discover, journalists are going down that path of inquiry. And so  they came in with, what I would consider kind of a light stunt, which is,  "Hey, we're making our product free for journalists until election day. Have at it, search  for whatever." They were covered for that. So they were able to quickly think about  it, they put up a blog post and they jumped on it, and this is  the story they got in TechCrunch. So, those are a few examples. You saw a  few examples of pitches, and I would say that's your number one tool. You're very  likely not in a place where reporters are kind of sitting on your site, refreshing  your blog wondering what the next news is going to be, so you need to  get to them. Blog post though is helpful to link to just to give extra  information, and to not attach stuff. It's a good kind of repository for the full  story, to have that if someone is interested they can click through. I get questions  about press releases. They're not really for startups. That's the truth. It's an older medium.  It used to be ... Gosh, it used to be even more intense than this,  I mean, it was like faxes coming into a newsroom. That used to be the  big utility of a press release. And then more recently, it was a good way  to get in Google News, it got you in search results. But Google has wised  up about that a lot, so it doesn't really do that anymore. Your blog has  just as much power to get into the search results as the press release does.  Press releases, if you're going to put them over the wire, cost like ... They  cost a couple thousand dollars. So it's not worth it for a startup. Really they're  a tool for public companies to make disclosures about market-moving news, so that's the main  folks that'll use it. I guess the only other exception would be if you are  in an industry that's kind of like an older-fashioned industry, like baking or aviation. Sometimes  a link to a press release on your site can establish credibility for partners, not  press, but partners or other people that you might want to get meetings with, for  lack of other press coverage. So, there's that. Visuals and assets are really great to  include, never as attachments because attachments are annoying. We all know that. Just link to  them, either on your site or at the Dropbox link, because every story will use  a visual anyway. A lot of outlets want to create their own visual for bigger  feature stories, but for a smaller news item, they might just screenshot your website or  find a picture of the founder speaking at some event. But maybe you don't like  that picture, maybe it's not flattering, so I always just say provide your own visuals  so, hopefully, they'll use on of those and you'll be happy. I don't know why  I shoved all this in one slide, but the other thing I want to talk  about in terms of official announcements are exclusives versus embargoes, which could be its own  slide about how to really, really, really piss off a reporter. So, listen closely because  this is important. These are two tools that are used in the PR world to  brief a reporter in advance of a news date, so that they can have a  full story ready to go on the day of the news. You can't use them  both together. I'm going to talk about them individually. And exclusive is I'm going to  talk to you, you one reporter, just me and you, you're getting the full story  and that's it. You're the only one I'm talking to about this until after you  post your story. And then if someone calls me, I can talk to them, but  they're not going to have the story ready to go, it's yours. That's an exclusive.  It's as serious as a monogamous relationship. You should not mess with an exclusive. If  you promise to give someone the story, it's theirs. Got it? Okay. An embargo is  if you have bigger news that you think multiple reporters might cover, which is common,  especially for a mid-sized startup that has people who are kind of following their news.  You can reach out and say to each of the reporters, "I have some news.  I'd like to pre-brief you on it. The news is going out on June 15th  at 8:00 AM Pacific. Would you like the news? Will you agree to the embargo?"  And they say yes, they're basically saying, "Give me the news. If I write a  story, I will not publish it until that specific time that you told me." So,  the trick here is usually to make sure you're being really clear in communication with  everyone, because if you send one reporter the wrong time and they post their story  earlier, then there's four reporters who had a story that was all ready but they  were respecting your ask. So, it's kind of a little weird, but these are things  that exist that are tools. And I would say, specifically for an exclusive, it's something  that we use a lot for early-stage startups because if you're reaching out to a  reporter and you have ... The customer story, the one from Thunkable, that was actually  offered as an exclusive. That was kind of an extra carat to say, "Hey, this  is a cool story and we'll give it to you, just you." So, the reporter  then knows, okay, well I can either take my time to actually talk to the  customer, and I'm not racing against the clock because someone else might write it before  I do. So it allows them to take their time, take a breath and write  the story they want. And also it's nice to not have to complete for clicks  on the story with other outlets. That's why it's used as a tool, but just  make sure to respect it and use it carefully. Last of all, listen and be  a source. It's one thing to reach out when you have news, but kind of  on your day-to-day, you're really just following the news and possibly taking opportunities to be  a source. These are just a couple of things you guys know about Google and  RSS feeds. One thing you might not know about is this tool called HARO, it's  Help a Reporter Out, and the website is helpareporter.com. It's free, you can subscribe to  it. It's kind of a lot, you get three emails every day. Basically what is,  reporters will ... They're seeking a source for their story, so they'll actually submit a  request for a source, "Hey, I'm looking for an expert on molecular biology. Deadline is  tomorrow at 5:00 PM Pacific." And so you see that, you're an expert on molecular  biology, so you can actually reply and kind of let them know about yourself and  maybe they can use you as a source. So, it's a good way. Sometimes you  can really strike it big and there's something right on the money, but it's not  a guaranteed road to coverage. Also some reporters will tweet when they need a source.  They'll say, "Hey, I'm looking for someone who's an expert on this." That's another way.  Also a lot of reporters will tweet their own coverage. So again, if you're reading  a reporter's coverage and kind of understanding what motivates them to write or what types  of stories are cool for them. Twitter's a great place to hang out as well.  A couple of quick examples of being a good source. The one I always talk  about is Sam Altman, having worked with him. He just wanted to help out because  he was just interested in the story. And so this is kind of the true  test of a founder who gets PR from me, is someone who just thinks the  story is cool, someone who actually wants reporters to have the tools to put out  a great story, so he would reach out even if something wasn't in the realm  of Loopt. If there was a story about augmented reality or something, he would ping  someone and say, "Hey, I'm really interested in augmented reality. I know a lot about  it." And they would call him even though there wasn't a specific Loopt tie-in. That  was a way that he was there for them, so when we did have news,  they at least looked at the email. It helped just kind of get that credibility,  because they knew he was interested in them getting a good story. Two recent examples  from Penny, another YC company in a recent batch. This New York Times example was  Penny saw this comment that Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of Chase, made about innovative  big startups not holding a candle to the offerings that Chase had for their own  customers, and was kind of crapping on innovative banking startups. And it wasn't widely covered,  it was only covered in a couple of places ... They saw it in Forbes.  And they noticed the New York Times hadn't covered it, and there was a specific  reporter who they had been continuing to read his coverage, Ron at the New York  Times, Ron Lieber, and they felt like Ron would be interested in the story, yet  he hadn't covered it. So they reached out to him and said, "Hey, have you  seen this news of what Jamie Dimon said? Here's what we think about it. We  think that innovative startups do have a place and we have this perspective, and I'm  an expert in this." And so he was able to jump on the phone with  a reporter, give him context and what he thought, and he was in the story  in the second paragraph and quoted twice. So this story that he wouldn't have been  in probably ... If the reporter had picked it up on his own, he probably  wouldn't have been in it, but he was in it because he was able to  kind of guide the reporter through, or at least help him get to a place  where he wanted to write about it. And the other thing that Penny worked on  is they had talked to a Bloomberg reporter about chatbots because she had written a  story about that, and they wanted to kind of give her some more experience ...  I guess I didn't really say what Penny did. They're a personal finance app, so  it's like a personal finance coach in your pocket and it's a bot ... So  they were talking to her about bots and she mentioned to them there were two  stories she was working on, one about equity, grants, and one about diversity hiring. It  was just kind of conversation, but they realized they had a friend who know a  lot about equity grants so they connected her to the friend, and that was just  kind of a nice gesture they did. And then when they were starting to look  for their first engineering hire, these two male founders with an app called Penny and  a female bot wanted to hire a female engineer to help to balance out their  company from the beginning. They reached out to her and said, "Hey, I know you  were interested in this, we're actually doing this now. Anyway, hope you're having a good  day. That's what we're doing." So she got back with them and said, "Hey, I  want to profile you through your whole hiring process." So she shadowed them through this  in-depth podcast on their hiring process. So, this wasn't the story that they dreamt of  in Bloomberg probably, a story about their hiring process verus their business, but it was  a great way to develop this relationship with this reporter. The piece ended up turning  out really great. They did end up making a hire. This to me is just  a good example of a founder that gets a good story and will invest in  just kind of making that happen. So, this is kind of it. The other tools  that you have are responding to articles. If there's an article that you might even  disagree with or have a different point of view, that's another opportunity to reach out.  It's not always just news-driven or trend-driven, it could just be, "Hey, you wrote this.  I don't know if you ever thought about this way. Anyway, if you ever want  to explore this side, let me know, I'm here." Also, the media's changing. Getting an  article written about you isn't the only way for someone to start seeing you as  an authority. There are small things you can do like commentate on an article, not  self-promotional, not plugging your business in any big way, but just as an interested person  in this topic. Commenting on a article on reddit, Quora, and even creating your own  content on your blog or on Medium, these are good ways to start just kind  of dipping your toe and establishing your credibility in the field that you operate in.  So, those are some small things that you can do. Questions? Actually, as a surprise,  we have Steven Levy here, who is at Backchannel ... Come on up, Steven ...  and formerly at WIRED, and Newsweek way back. He's a surprise, but this a journalist.  You can ask questions to him as well. You can either ask me or the  person who's on the other line of these questions.
Steven: And actually this is a super clueful presentation, I have to say.
Sharon: Thank you, Steven.
Steven: And you don't hear that from all people in the PR industry.
Sharon: I think that's true, yeah.
Steven: So, very good.
Sharon: We do have a question back there.
Participant 2: I was just trying to understand the advantages of the exclusive versus non-exclusive. I imagined  that being non-exclusive could potentially lead to more press, at least in the case of  Thunkable , so there's getting a better story. But what are some of the other  advantages of doing exclusive?
Sharon: Steven, do you need me to repeat the question?
Steven: Yes.
Sharon: Repeat it. So the question is what are the advantages of doing an exclusive verus  an embargo, because what your understanding was that if you do an embargo, you get  more stories?
Steven: Sure, I'm dealing with this a lot. For what I do, I much prefer exclusives.  The publication I founded and write for called Backchannel is we don't do a lot  of stories, we're not a trade publication like TechCrunch, so we're not going to cover  everything. We cover things that are special and we can tell things in depth. For  us, it's important to have an exclusive. We don't want to write the generic story  that everyone else writes there. And the other problem with embargoes is that ... First  off, what you have has to be important to get a lot of reporters involved  in there for a non-exclusive story. What often happens is that someone gets wind of  it and then someone will tweet, "Oh, there's a company that does X," and there's  four reporters sitting there with the story. And one of them will have an editor  that says, "That's it, the embargo's broken. Let's jut go with it." I would say  well over half of the embargoes I've ever been involved with get broken and there's  bad feelings-
Sharon: I would have said 25%.
Steven: I say over half. And my pet peeve is always that if a big publication  like Businessweek or The New York Times breaks an embargo, sometimes accidentally, "We thought it  was West Coast time," or something like that, they never suffer consequences there. If you  have an important story to tell, and particularly if it's a complex story that can't  be summed up neatly in a sentence but what you have is really cool and  needs explanation, then you really want an exclusive story, a reporter who's going to find  it worthwhile to spend a lot of time with you and your company and tell  that definitive story. You put it on the web, everyone gets to read it. For  example, I did this story about this company called Viv, which was people who used  to do the Siri product there. I did it for WIRED. It was actually my  last story in the magazine, until this week actually. It was a couple of years  ago. They actually used that on their website to explain themselves for a couple of  years.
Sharon: Yeah, it's kind of ... And I think that's the key point about exclusives. If  someone can go deeper, then as a business that's a tool for you. It's part  of the tapestry of your company. It's kind of the top of the search results.  It's something that someone can actually take and read and fall in love with your  company, especially for recruiting, partnerships. That story's in your email signature and you can really  cherish it. I think there's a question right behind you.
Participant 3: Steven, could you sort of go through some of the major different types of publications.  There is TechCrunch, there is New York Times and sort of mainstream media, but then  there's the new wave of media companies on Medium, and then there's there's all these  different types, could you sort of go through the pros and cons to the different  major categories that you see?
Steven: Yeah, sure. Ultimately, when you're going to do your pitch, you're going to do what  Sharon says and really get yourself familiar with them. The larger distinctions is that a  publication like TechCrunch considers itself almost definitive to say anything important in the industry, we're  going to do. I don't know if YC still does this, but when I last  did a dive in a batch, they had almost an informal relationship that the company's  time came, TechCrunch would basically run their verbal press release. They'd have a call scheduled  and someone would read it out. I don't know if there were so many companies  there-
Sharon: Yeah, there's so many more companies, but it's a top target for a lot of  YC companies.
Steven: Because they're going to do a lot of stuff there, and they're interested in the  business. Traditional publications, again, they're not going to do as much. They're going to figure  out is this significant in a business sense or a technology sense, in which case  actually you might have to consider a different reporter for one of those publications there.  If your company is an AI company, you're going to talk to the person who  covers AI, as opposed to the retail thing if you're a commerce company. A lot  of the newer publications ... My publication started on Medium. We started actually as part  of Medium. Again, lots of different kinds of stuff. Some of them are really focused  on what startup life is like, in which case you might have something unique to  offer. We do a thing in my publication, because a lot of people in this  community read us, called War Stories. If someone has a really interesting story to tell  about what they do ... Typically, actually it's people who've already established themselves and talk  about at a crucial part in the formation of their company. Even so, some of  the younger companies I've seen there has stories interesting enough. We did one with ...  what's it ... Instaart-
Sharon: Instacart?
Steven: instaart, the art that does Chris Chan, a guy we somehow captivated with. He was  this young guy from Detroit who wound up being a sole founder, did a few  pivots and wound up to have these people in Hong Kong create paintings based on  your photographs. Do you remember that company?
Participant 4: Instapainting.
Steven: Instapainting, yeah. And I followed him, he was helpful ... Again, it's the source thing.  He was helpful to me talking about his life as a startup when I did  a story about that batch, and then later I was connected with him and wound  up writing about his company.
Sharon: That's great. Just to add on to the TechCrunch element too. When companies are in  YC, often times their goal after YC is to get investment, which is why TechCrunch  tends to be their top target. It's not every company that has that as their  top target, but if you think about who's your audience, if your audience is investors,  maybe the outlet is TechCrunch.
Participant 5: So I was wondering about the benefits of kind of reaching out to reporters versus  generating your own PR with Medium articles or Twitter, basically other forms of social media.  Do you feel like you really need to kind of reach out to reporters to  kind of generate the publicity that you might like?
Sharon: The question is how would you weigh reaching out to reporters against things you can  do yourself like writing media articles and being active on social media? I'm sure you  have an opinion. My opinion is pretty brief. It's that they're not mutually exclusive. I  think that your story through your voice is amazing, and if you're able to start  developing content that's on-point for your customers and for people who follow your company, that's  amazing, and that's helpful for SEO. So from a pure business standpoint, it's helpful, but  it's also great to create a dialogue where you can actually answer your customers' problems.  The other thing that's helpful is to have a third party validate your business by  thinking it's cool and writing a piece on it.
Steven: That's generally right, but if everything is out in a Medium story, it's a little  less delicious for a reporter to do that. I did a story about a startup  called Bonsai recently, and interestingly that came from a relationship I had with a PR  person who really knows my work and knows, okay, this is a guy who likes  to do things that really move the ball, and this is something different there that  I think is going to meet Steven's needs. And they had done some stuff on  Medium and I looked hard at that to say, "Boy, did they give the story  away," even though if you just put up stuff on Medium, you're not necessarily ...  it would have to be pretty rare to get huge readership from that. I say  ultimately then it doesn't really matter, not many people have read it. But if you  got what you wanted and it took off, if might make a reporter think twice  to say, "Gee, that story's been told already."
Sharon: I think that might have blown past the common sense point of the big part  of news is that it's new, that someone hasn't talked about it yet, and that's  the compelling point for reporters. Any other questions?
Participant 6: Can you talk about the balance between sort of crafting and scaffolding a story that  you directly give to reporters verus letting them do what they want with it based  on one hand it's less work for them, but on the other hand they sort  of exercise less creativity if you give them a narrative they can copy and paste  into their article?
Sharon: So the question is, and I'm going to ask Steven to answer it, is what's  the balance between doing a lot of pre-work and giving kind of an outline to  a reporter ... As you said, scaffolding ... Versus just letting a reporter run with  it?
Steven: Well, I mean, you're going to need focus to explain what it is, but once  the things get rolling, the reporter is going to want to take his or her  take on the thing there. Reporters just don't like being directed or saying, "This is  our story, don't pay attention to that." Once you open the door, we're in. I  hope what you want to say is interesting enough to keep us from what we  find interesting.
Sharon: I think pre-work is helpful, at least in my getting responses from folks, because you  have to make sure they get that it's a cool story. So just saying this  is my company, your thoughts, is maybe not going to be enough. You need to  talk to them about the cool thing you're doing that they might be interested in.  And it also brings up another point that there are no rewrites. So the reporter  gets to have their time with your story and you don't get to review a  draft or edit it, which I know seems common sense, but it is a question  I get a lot. Any other questions? Okay. Thank you. Thank you to our surprise  guest, Steven Levy.
