# How to Think About PR - Sharon Pope

Sharon: Okay. Hi everyone. We're going to talk about public relations today.

莎伦：好的。大家好。今天我们要谈谈公共关系。

I'm Sharon.

我是莎伦。

I actually  work at Y Combinator and I work on our continuity team, which is the team  that does growth-stage investing, so Series B, Series C investing, and also trying to create  programs and give advice to founders as they enter into a different phase of their  startup. Right after they've built a great product, they have to then go build a  company and make it a really great company, so that's what we try to help  with on the continuity team. Before I was at YC, I was the chief marketing  officer at Green Dot, which is a fintech company, makes prepaid debit cards and checking  accounts that don't let you overdraft, so really targeting an underbanked population.

我实际上在Y Combinator工作，我在我们的连续性团队工作，这个团队从事成长阶段的投资，所以系列B，C系列投资，还试图创建项目，并在创始人进入他们的创业的不同阶段时给他们提供建议。在他们建立了一个伟大的产品之后，他们必须去建立一个公司，让它成为一个真正伟大的公司，所以这就是我们在连续性团队中努力帮助的地方。在YC之前，我是绿点(Green Dot)的首席营销官，这家公司是金融科技的一家公司，生产预支借记卡和支票账户，不让你透支，所以我的目标是银行不足的人群。

It's a public  company, and I got there by being acquired ...

这是一家上市公司，我是被收购的.

I was at Loopt, which is  a startup, is actually a Sam Altman startup.

我在Loopt，这是一家初创公司，实际上是SamAltman的初创公司。

I worked with Sam there for two  years, and before that I was at PR agencies.

我和萨姆在那里工作了两年，在那之前我在公关公司工作。

I was at two different PR  agencies, probably had a total of 20 clients over that period of time, ranging from  startups to big companies like Intel.

我在两家不同的公关公司工作，可能在这段时间里总共有20个客户，从初创公司到英特尔这样的大公司。

I've done a lot of on-the-ground PR work and  also have thought about it from a strategic level, and also get to talk to  founders from YC everyday about PR and marketing. That's why I'm here talking to you,  and the tough thing is ... Even though this is going to be about PR,  you're not going to escape the standard YC advice, which is while PR might be  interesting and something that could help in some ways for your business, your number one  job as a founder is to focus on your product. You're not going to escape  that. So even if PR is interesting, that's the key goal.

我做了很多实地公关工作，也从战略层面考虑过，每天都能和YC的创始人谈论公关和市场营销。所以我才来找你，最难的是.尽管这将是关于公关的，但你不会逃避YC的标准建议，虽然公关可能很有趣，而且在某种程度上对你的业务有帮助，但作为创始人，你的首要工作是专注于你的产品。你逃不掉的。因此，即使公关是有趣的，这也是关键目标。

I bring it up  because without product innovation, PR is not going to be an option for you. This  startup curve is the one that Paul Graham drew way back, it probably looks familiar.  The fact is you could get some great article written about your product, but if  you get people in there and they're disenchanted by it or not impressed, they're not  going to come back, so you're not going to have something that's ongoing that you  can really depend on.

我之所以提出来，是因为如果没有产品创新，公关就不会成为你的选择。这条创业曲线是保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)在很久以前画出来的，可能看起来很熟悉。事实是，你可以得到一些关于你的产品的很棒的文章，但是如果你让人们对你的产品不再抱有幻想或者印象不深，他们就不会回来了，所以你就不会有一些你能真正依赖的东西。

It's not a customer acquisition channel.

这不是一个客户获取渠道。

If press motivates you, if  being on the cover of WIRED is something that you think will be cool, that's  cool, have that motivate you and create a product that press cannot ignore, right? That's  how you get great PR results, is creating an amazing product. So, that's the first  thing you can do. Now that's said, you know that's your first job, but there  are some things ...

如果媒体激励你，如果在有线的封面是你认为会很酷，那很酷，有激励你，创造一个产品，媒体不能忽视，对吗？这就是你如何获得伟大的公关成果，正在创造一个惊人的产品。所以，这是你能做的第一件事。这就是说，你知道这是你的第一份工作，但有些事.

I am going to actually give you some tangible tools and  steps that you can take to start a PR program. My first tip though for  early-stage founders is don't go and hire a PR agency or PR person.

我将给你一些具体的工具和步骤，你可以采取的开始一个公关计划。不过，对于早期创始人来说，我的第一条建议是，不要去雇佣公关机构或公关人员。

I really  believe for early-stage founders that founder-led PR is simply the only way to go, for  a lot of reasons, but mainly I think it's actually special. Reporters like hearing from  founders, that's the end spokesperson for them. So there's not someone going in between, there's  someone who they genuinely can learn from and gather information from, knocking right on their  door ...

我真的相信对于早期的创始人来说，创始人领导的公关是唯一的出路，因为有很多原因，但我主要认为它实际上是特别的。记者喜欢听取创始人的意见，这是他们最终的代言人。所以没有人在中间，有一个人他们可以真正地向他们学习和收集信息，敲他们的门.

I guess usually in this forum, an email ... But you're getting exposure  to someone who could actually be a spokesperson for you. So it's special, and it's  something that's kind of unique to the vibe that you can pull off when you're  at a early stage. And the other side is you have something to offer. You  may pitch some reporter today and might not fit into their coverage for the day  or for the week, but in a month something relevant to that area could happen,  and they'll call you because you're a subject matter expert, you know your domain, you  know your business, and that helps them craft a story, that helps them give background  to a story.

我想通常在这个论坛上，一封电子邮件.但你现在接触到的人可能是你的代言人。所以，它是特别的，这是一种独特的感觉，当你还处于早期阶段时，你就可以做到这一点。另一面是你可以提供一些东西。你今天可能会向某个记者推介，也许他们的报道不适合某一天或某周的报道，但在一个月内，可能会发生一些与该领域相关的事情，他们会打电话给你，因为你是一个主题专家，你知道你的领域，你了解你的业务，这有助于他们制作一个故事，帮助他们提供一个故事的背景。

I would kind of think about it as not a switch you  can flip from a PR perspective, but really you're trying to establish a relationship and  trying to just get the ball rolling getting your company name out there, your product  out there, and just establishing yourself as an incredible spokesperson. This is the next question  I always get when I say that first speech, so I just really want to  take a second to just knock down these myths.

我认为这不是一个从公关角度出发的转变，但你真的想建立一种关系，让你的公司的名字、你的产品走出去，让你自己成为一个令人难以置信的代言人。当我说第一次演讲的时候，这是下一个问题，所以我真的很想花点时间来打破这些神话。

I even sent out some questions  to a lot of folks in startup school, and I got some of these questions  back about PR agencies. First reason why people might think that they really, really need  a PR person to come in right away and help them, that they might help  define the business and de-jargonize it. Yes, communications folks can be really good at that,  but you're kind of depriving yourself of a process that's going to be really useful  beyond media relations. Being able to define your business in a clear and concise way  is going to pay back in every aspect of your business. When you're talking to  a potential investor, when you're talking to a potential partner, when you're trying to hire  your first few engineers, you need to able to clearly pitch them on what makes  your business special and why they should listen to you. So, don't deprive yourself of  that process. They come up with story angles, right, so they're paying attention to the  news. Well, you're a better spokesperson and founder if you follow the news. You need  to understand where your business sits in the news.

我甚至向许多创业学校的人提出了一些问题，我还得到了一些关于公关机构的问题。第一个原因，人们可能会认为他们真的，真的需要一个公关人员来帮助他们，他们可能会帮助定义业务，并将其分解。是的，沟通人员可以很好的做到这一点，但是你在某种程度上剥夺了你自己的一个过程，这个过程在媒体关系之外是非常有用的。能够以清晰、简洁的方式定义你的业务，这将在你的业务的每一个方面都得到回报。当你与潜在的投资者交谈时，当你与潜在的合作伙伴交谈时，当你试图雇用你的第一批工程师时，你需要清楚地向他们宣传什么使你的业务特别，为什么他们应该倾听你的意见。所以，不要剥夺你自己的过程。他们想出了故事的角度，对，所以他们关注新闻。如果你关注新闻，你是个更好的代言人和创始人。你需要了解你的业务在新闻中的位置。

I'm not saying you should spend  five hours a day poring over every news site, but you should have a good  pulse, couple times a day, check in and look at the stories that are relevant  to your business and just more broadly understand where your business fits in the world.  The third reason, and the most common reason I get, is that they know the  reporters, they hold these relationships, they are the ones that make it happen.

我并不是说你应该每天花五个小时浏览每一个新闻网站，但你应该有一个好的脉搏，每天几次，检查并查看与你的业务相关的故事，更广泛地了解你的业务在世界上的位置。第三个原因，也是我得到的最常见的原因，是他们认识记者，他们持有这些关系，他们是促成这种关系的人。

I'll tell  you no credible reporter would ever write a story because they went to drinks with  someone. They'll write a story because it's a good story, right, so a story always  trumps a relationship. Focus on that, focus on a product that has a story, focus  on a product that has traction, which is a story, and that's what can pull  ... That's what can start creating those relationships for you.

我告诉你，没有一个可信的记者会因为他们和某人一起去喝酒而写一篇报道。他们会写一个故事，因为它是一个好故事，对吧，所以一个故事总是胜过一段关系。专注于这个，专注于一个有故事的产品，专注于一个有吸引力的产品，这就是一个故事，这才是能够拉动…这就是开始为你建立这些关系的原因。

It's not a magic kind  of key that you can turn. They field media inquiries, so they'll be able to  respond to press in a timely manner.

这不是一种神奇的钥匙，你可以转动。他们进行媒体调查，以便能够及时回应媒体。

It's a pretty high-class problem to have.

这是个相当高级的问题。

If  you're getting tons of media inquiries that you're drowning in them, you probably have some  pretty good product traction and maybe you're having a blazing success, and then you have  permission to hire a strategic communications partner who can help you through that. And lastly,  they're good at sending invoices. Not to minimize that to a PR agency or a  PR professional, but this is ...

如果你收到了大量的媒体询问，说你被它们淹没了，你可能拥有相当好的产品吸引力，也许你取得了巨大的成功，然后你得到了聘用一位能帮你度过难关的战略沟通伙伴的许可。最后，他们擅长发票。不是为了减少对公关机构或公关专业人员的影响，但这是.

It's essentially overhead in a lot of ways because  there's no guaranteed results. An agency can come in, they don't know your business, they  have to learn your business, so probably about a month out. And then they start  pitching, it might be two weeks out, three weeks out, two months before you even  get a story in the news. Even then, that's not guaranteed to drive specific business  goal because it's not an engaged, measurable customer acquisition tactic. Get to a place where  you have a really good team that can build that great product, your engineering team,  your product team, yourself, and that's what you should focus on. So, hopefully I've convinced  you. But I do think that there are some simple things the founders can do  to chip away at the PR goals themselves. And eventually once you are a success,  you should hire a PR firm. They're cool, I used to work at one. Okay.  So, five steps, and these are really based on my experience. But I'm also weaving  in some common YC advice that the batches receive when they come through YC, specifically  this one: Who are you? This long list is the checklist of a whiteboarding session  at Y Combinator. Companies that come through YC will get this great presentation by Kat  Manalac who's a partner at YC, and then they'll meet with their group partners and  go through each of these questions. This is something that I implore you to take  time and think about.

这在很多方面都是间接的，因为没有保证的结果。一个机构可以进来，他们不知道你的业务，他们必须学习你的业务，所以大概有一个月的时间。然后他们开始投球，可能要两个星期，三个星期，两个月后你才能在新闻里看到一个故事。即便如此，这也不一定能推动具体的业务目标，因为这不是一种投入的、可衡量的客户获取策略。到一个你有一个非常好的团队，可以建立一个伟大的产品，你的工程团队，你的产品团队，你自己，这是你应该关注的地方。希望我能说服你。但我确实认为，创始人们可以做一些简单的事情来削减自己的公关目标。最终，一旦你成功了，你就应该雇佣一家公关公司。他们很酷，我以前在一家公司工作。好的。所以，五个步骤，这些都是基于我的经验。但我也在编写一些常见的YC建议，当批次通过YC时，它们会收到这些建议，特别是这个：您是谁？这个长列表是Y Combinator的白板会话的清单。那些通过YC的公司将得到YC合伙人Kat Manalac的精彩演讲，然后他们会与他们的团队合作伙伴会面，并讨论每一个问题。这是我恳请你花点时间想一想的。

Invite a family member or a friend in, someone who's not  steeped in your world who can actually kind of give you some real advice on  whether or not your description is jargon or makes sense to the common man in  Anytown, USA, but most importantly what does your company do. We'll talk about that more.  Being able to describe your customer, so how does your product live through your customer,  through the lens of their customer. People like stories about people, so this is a  great one for PR. What problem are you solving, and how are you measuring how  you're growing, and how are you growing? Who are your competitors, and why are you  better than your competitors? What are your plans for next year? And I think one  of the more important ones for PR as well is why you? Why did you  start this company? Why are you uniquely qualified to bring this product to the world?  And that can range from stories of something you overcame that caused you to explore  this field and to conquer this technology and this innovation, or it could be that  you came from a company that has done this kind of, and you broke off  and are doing it better. So, the founder stories are really great to establish early  on because sometimes we can forget that about ourselves, that we bring something special to  the table. To dive a little bit deeper on the "What does your company do?"  The biggest advice is to lead with the what, not the why. And what I  mean by that is even though we've established that you're all cool founders and that  you're uniquely qualified to start your business, that's kind of a long story to get  all at once.

邀请一个家庭成员或朋友，一个没有沉浸在你的世界里的人，他可以给你一些真正的建议，看看你的描述是行话还是对美国任何一个普通男人来说都有意义，但最重要的是，你的公司是做什么的。我们会更多地讨论这个问题。能够描述你的客户，那么你的产品是如何通过你的客户，通过他们的客户的镜头生活的。人们喜欢关于人的故事，所以这对公关来说是一个很棒的故事。你在解决什么问题，你是如何衡量你是如何成长的，你是如何成长的？谁是你的竞争对手，为什么你比你的竞争对手更好？你明年有什么计划？我认为公关最重要的问题之一就是你为什么？你为什么创办这家公司？你为什么有独特的资格把这种产品带到世界各地？这可能是你克服了一些事情的故事，让你探索了这个领域，征服了这一技术和创新，也可能是你来自一家做过这种事情的公司，而你已经分手了，而且做得更好了。所以，创办人的故事很早就能建立起来，因为有时候我们会忘记自己，我们会给我们带来一些特别的东西。“你的公司是做什么的？”最大的建议是用什么来领导，而不是为什么。我的意思是，尽管我们已经确定你们都是很酷的创始人，而且你们有独特的能力来创业，但这是一个很长的故事。

Instead of some big paragraph where I have to really try to  navigate and understand what your company actually is, it's a lot easier for you to  say to me, "Well, is Boeing for electric airplanes." I get that. You're making them,  they're electric. Tell me more, I want to lean in, I want to hear more  ... Actual company from the last batch of YC by the way. Dropbox, it synchronizes  your files across your and your team's computers. That's easy to understand.

我不需要在一段大段中真正地尝试浏览和理解贵公司的实际情况，而是让你更容易地对我说，“好吧，是波音公司的电动飞机。”我明白了。你在制造它们，它们是电动的。告诉我更多，我想要靠拢，我想听到更多.公司实际从上一批YC顺便提一下。Dropbox，它在您和您团队的计算机上同步您的文件。这很容易理解。

It might seem  silly now, but this was actually their description on their YC application years and years  ago. The overall summary here is make it conversational, which means no jargon, no preamble,  just get right to it. And above all, make it concise. Step two, we're going  to define your goals and your audience. And this one ...

这可能现在看起来很傻，但这实际上是他们多年前在YC应用程序上的描述。这里的总体总结是让它成为对话，这意味着没有行话，没有序言，就直截了当地说吧。最重要的是，要简明扼要。第二步，我们将定义你的目标和你的听众。而这个.。

It's kind of a  first principles type process because PR actually isn't a goal, so saying my goal is  to get a lot of press, it actually isn't your goal.

这是一种第一原则类型的过程，因为公关实际上不是一个目标，所以说我的目标是得到很多压力，这实际上不是你的目标。

If you really, really  step back, you're actually striving towards a business goal, so you want to maybe recruit  the best talent, you want to finance your growth, drive trial, land strategic partners. You  have things that you're trying to do with your business, so you want to ask  yourself this is the business thing I want to do, is there an audience that  I can maybe influence to help me get there? Press aren't the audience. They have  readers though, so press might be the window to your audience. Getting a story placed  or working with press to get some story placed could be a way to reach  this priority audience.

如果你真的，真的后退一步，你实际上是在为一个商业目标而努力，所以你想要招募最优秀的人才，你想为你的成长提供资金，推动试验，建立战略合作伙伴。你有你想要做的事情，所以你想问自己，这是我想做的事情，我是否可以影响观众来帮助我达到这个目标？媒体不是观众。他们有读者，所以媒体可能是你观众的窗口。得到一个故事放置或与新闻工作，以获得一些故事的位置，可能是一种方式，以达到这一优先受众。

If your priority or your business goal is to finance growth, your  audience might be investors, right? So that's kind of how you need to break it  down and really try to prioritize it, because if everything is a priority, then nothing's  a priority. So, really try to focus in.

如果你的首要目标或商业目标是为增长融资，你的受众可能是投资者，对吗？所以这就是你需要打破它的方式，并真正地尝试它的优先次序，因为如果一切都是优先的，那么没有什么是优先的。所以，真的要集中精力。

If your goal of press is investors,  it's actually going to influence the reporters that you try to talk to and the  publications that you try to get in. The other piece of YC advice, that I'm  sure you're already all doing, is building your product and talking to customers and repeat,  repeat, repeat.

如果你的新闻目标是投资者，它实际上会影响到你想采访的记者和你想进入的出版物。YC的另一条建议，我相信你们已经在做了，就是建立你的产品，和客户交谈，重复。

If you're talking to your customers anyway, maybe ask them what they read,  and that's a good way to kind of get to what outlets you might want  to consider thinking to get in. Which brings us to out next step, step three,  reading, which might seem common sense, but ...

如果你无论如何都在和你的客户交谈，也许可以问问他们读了什么，这是一个很好的方法，可以找到你想要进入的商店。这就引出了下一步，第三步，阅读，这似乎是常识，但是.

If you already read the news, probably  you already do, it's just maybe putting a little bit more structure around how you  look at the news.

如果你已经看过新闻了，也许你已经读过了，这可能只是在你看待新闻的方式上设置了一些更多的结构。

If you read a really compelling article that you feel like  hits some of the notes, that you as a founder represent or that your product  speaks to, then look at who wrote it. That person maybe will be interested in  a story about you and your company. The big tips here as you kind of  prepare ...

如果你读了一篇很有说服力的文章，你觉得自己读到了其中的一些笔记，你作为创办人的代表，或者你的产品的代言人，那就看看是谁写的。那个人可能会对你和你的公司的故事感兴趣。当你准备的时候这里的大提示.。

I get a lot of questions from founders on how to bring efficiency  to this. The real answer is there's not tons of efficiency in this, this is  about relationship building. There's not something that can automate it. But here's some tools, a  google spreadsheet. That's the biggest tool I think people might use for PR, so just  kind of organizing your thoughts. You read a great article, grab the link, note who  wrote it and write a little bit to yourself about what was relevant and how  you think your story might play with that same reporter, given their interest and given  the coverage area. Think about what angle might interest them, which we'll talk a little  bit more about, and then think about connections to them. So we talked about how  PR agencies aren't vital for relationships, but it is nice to get a warm introduction  to a reporter.

我从创始人那里得到了很多关于如何提高效率的问题。真正的答案是，这里没有大量的效率，这是关于建立关系的。没有什么东西能使它自动化。但这里有一些工具，谷歌电子表格。这是我认为人们在公关中可能用到的最大的工具，所以只是组织你的想法。你读了一篇很棒的文章，抓起链接，记下是谁写的，并给自己写了一点关于什么是相关的，以及你认为你的故事会如何与同一位记者合作，考虑到他们的兴趣和报道范围。想想他们可能感兴趣的角度，我们会讨论更多，然后考虑与他们的联系。所以我们讨论了公关机构对人际关系不重要的问题，但很高兴能得到一个热情的记者介绍。

If you see that that reporter has written about someone you know,  an investor might know them, so maybe another founder has appeared in the story. You  might reach out to that founder, draft an email up for them and say, "Hey,  would you mind introducing me to this reporter.

如果你看到那个记者写了一个你认识的人，一个投资者可能认识他们，所以也许另一个创办人出现在了这个故事中。你可以联系那个创始人，帮他们起草一封电子邮件，说：“嘿，你能把我介绍给这位记者吗？”

I think they might be interested in  my product." So, that's the connections to them column. On angle, I kind of wanted  to specifically point out business press because for an early-stage startup it's not always a  relevant target for people because ...

我想他们可能会对我的产品感兴趣。“所以，这就是他们的专栏。在角度上，我想特别指出商业媒体，因为对于早期的初创公司来说，这并不总是一个相关的目标，因为.

I'm going to do an audience question now. What  would you guess is the most common topic covered in business outlets?
Participant 1: Funding.

我现在要做一个观众问题。你猜商业网点最常见的话题是什么？与会者1：供资。

Sharon: Maybe, yes. For startups, yes, but the most covered topic is business. You have to  have something that ties to market-moving, commerce, the economy. Funding is a good example for  where a startup might get into this. Another example where a startup might be able  to get a story in the business press would be if you're really getting a  lot of traction and upsetting the stream of someone else's business, so you're taking advertising  dollars away from Facebook, or you have an app that can hail a car and  it's maybe disrupting a taxi business. These are the things that will get you into  business press even before you get really big because you're showing signs of disruption, you're  showing signs that there's something to look at here. So, I wanted to kind of  cover that one because it's a common question. The other element ... As you start  reaching out to reporters, and I'll give you examples of pitches that have actually gone  out. Just a reminder that everything you say is on the record. The reporter's job  is to get the story, and they just start gathering all the information you give  them.

莎伦：也许，是的。对于初创企业来说，是的，但最受关注的话题是商业。你必须有一些与市场，商业，经济有关的东西。资金是一个很好的例子，一家初创企业可能会进入这一阶段。另一个可以在商业媒体上得到报道的例子是，如果你真的获得了很大的吸引力，并扰乱了其他人的业务流程，那么你就会从Facebook上拿走广告收入，或者你有一个可以为汽车加油的应用程序，它可能会扰乱出租车业务。这些东西甚至在你变得真正的大之前就会让你进入商业媒体，因为你表现出了混乱的迹象，你在这里展示了一些值得关注的东西。所以，我想掩盖这个问题，因为这是一个常见的问题。另一个元素.。当你开始接触记者的时候，我会给你举一些实际已经退出的例子。只是提醒你所说的一切都记录在案。记者的工作是了解新闻，他们只是开始收集你给他们的所有信息。

If you share metrics of your business, they may write about them.

如果您共享您的业务的指标，他们可能会写他们。

It's the  common advice we give YC companies before Demo Day 2, when they're really excited to  share everything about their business and they share all their metrics, and they might be  surprised the next day when an article talks about the metrics of their business.

这是我们在演示第二天之前给YC公司的一个共同建议，当他们非常兴奋地分享他们业务的一切，他们分享他们的所有指标，当第二天当一篇文章谈到他们的业务的度量时，他们可能会感到惊讶。

It  might seem like common sense advice, but it's really easy to forget in the moment.  Just keep in mind, be open, be transparent, share honestly, but if you don't want  your metrics in the news, don't share them. Okay, what to say and timed outreach.  You're going to start reaching out. You have already looked at your year ahead and  thought about what news you might have. Maybe it's your actual company launch, maybe it's  a product launch. Maybe you have fundraising, maybe you got some investment. You might hit  some milestones, maybe you have some statistics that are cool. These are all examples of  company-fueled news. The other type of news is trend-based news, so how your company fits  in a bigger trend.

这似乎是常识上的建议，但现在却很容易忘记。记住，要开放，要透明，要诚实分享，但是如果你不想在新闻中看到你的指标，就不要分享它们。好吧，该说什么和时间的拓展。你要开始伸出援手了。你已经看了你的未来一年，并考虑你可能会有什么消息。也许这是你真正的公司推出，也许是产品上市。也许你有筹款，也许你得到了一些投资。你可能会达到一些里程碑，也许你有一些很酷的统计数据。这些都是公司新闻的例子。另一种类型的新闻是基于趋势的新闻，所以你的公司如何适应更大的趋势。

It's things like a roundup of new finance apps, and maybe  you're going to be one of those apps that's named.

这就像一个新的金融应用的综合，也许你会成为其中一个被命名的应用程序。

I usually say that journalists  will usually only name three. They're not going to spend their day listing an exhaustive  list of all the 15, 20, 30 apps that exist. To the degree that you  have engaged with the reporter in a meaningful way, it may be that they don't  write about your news story one week, but maybe three weeks from now they're going  to do a round up and you'll be in it. So, there are some things  where just the relationship and just reaching out is good and can kind of pay  back later. Also politics, entertainment. When that kind of news happens, sometimes there's an opportunity  to jump on and be included in some way. And also contextualizing other company announcements.  If Apple has big developer news, then maybe your developer have something to say or  contribute, so reaching out and saying, "Hey, here's what I think about it. Let me  know if you want to talk." That can be a way to get your company  into the conversation. So, here's an actual example. Simple Habit was in YC's last batch,  and it's essentially Spotify for meditation. Yunha, the founder, specifically wanted to get coverage in  Engadget, so she found this reporter, Nathan ... He wrote several times about different streaming  apps and was specifically in new kinds of content, so he's written about Spotify, written  about YouTube TV. And so she approached him. She had some seed funding to announce.  Engadget doesn't actually write that much about fundraising and she knew that, so she reached  out, shared the fundraising news, but also shared that they were going to be doing  a new release that had a bunch more content coming out and a few new  features, and he was interested. He asked for more information, she shared some visuals, and  this is the story. So, that's a great example of something that Simple Habit did,  relevant pitch to the right reporter around news item. Here's another example. This is not  company-milestone based, but actually customer based. We talked about showing your product through the eyes  of the customer. This, YC company again, Thunkable, which lets anybody build mobile apps without  knowing how to code, they discovered this customer they had in Yemen who, again, without  knowing how to code, developed a solar app, or basically an app that brought thousands  of people solar power that had lost power due to civil war in Yemen.

我通常说记者通常只说三个。他们不会花一天时间列出所有的15，20，30个应用程序。如果你以一种有意义的方式与记者打交道，也许他们不会在一周内报道你的新闻报道，但从现在起的三周后，他们会召集你，你也会参与其中。因此，有一些事情，仅仅是关系和接触是好的，可以在一定程度上回报。还有政治娱乐。当这类新闻发生时，有时会有机会跳下去，并以某种方式被包括在内。以及与其他公司公告相关的内容。如果苹果有大的开发者新闻，那么也许你的开发者有话要说，或者有贡献，所以伸出手说，“嘿，我是这么想的。如果你想说的话，请告诉我。”这可能是让你的公司参与谈话的一种方式。下面是一个实际的例子。简单的习惯是YC的最后一批，它本质上是冥想的Spotify。云哈，创办人，特别是想在英格吉特得到报道，所以她找到了这位记者内森.他写了好几次关于不同流媒体应用的文章，并且专门写了一些新的内容，所以他写了关于Spotify的文章，写了关于YouTube电视的文章。于是她走近了他。她有一些种子基金要宣布。Engadget并没有写太多关于募捐的文章，她知道这一点，所以她分享了募捐的消息，但也分享了他们将要做的一个新的发行版，里面有更多的内容和一些新的功能，他很感兴趣。他要求更多的信息，她分享了一些视觉效果，这就是故事。因此，这是一个很好的例子，简单的习惯所做的事情，相关的宣传，正确的记者周围的新闻项目。这是另一个例子。这不是基于公司的里程碑，而是基于客户的。我们说过要通过顾客的眼睛展示你的产品。这是YC公司，Thunable公司，它允许任何人在不知道如何编码的情况下构建移动应用程序，他们发现了一个在也门的客户，他在不知道如何编码的情况下，开发了一个太阳能应用程序，或者基本上是一个应用程序，它为成千上万的人带来了太阳能，这些太阳能在也门的内战中失去了电力。

It's  a pretty cool story, right? They drafted up a pitch. They knew someone who knew  the reporter ... The founder knew someone who knew the reporter ... And drafted up  an email for that person to then send to a reporter at Fast Company. This  is the email asking if they can intro, giving a little bit of context, giving  that really short business description, and the reporter was interested. This is the story in  Fast Company. And here's an example of riding the news waves. We talked about politics  and entertainment possibly being something to jump on.

这是个很酷的故事，对吧？他们起草了一份推荐信。他们认识一个认识记者的人.。创办人认识一个认识记者的人.。并起草了一封电子邮件，让该人然后发送给一名记者在快速公司。这是一封电子邮件，询问他们是否可以介绍，给出一些背景，给出非常简短的商业描述，记者对此很感兴趣。这是“快速公司”的故事。这是一个乘坐新闻波的例子。我们谈到了政治和娱乐可能是什么东西跳下去。

It's not everyday that this is an  opportunity, so this is not your common example. We all might remember last October there  was some tapes that were leaked of Donald Trump saying lewd things on a bus,  and it was, to put it mildly, major news in the US, probably around the  world. This happened on October 8th I think. Deepgram, another YC company, their product is  basically search for speech, so they can search audio files like Google searches images. And  so they saw an opportunity with all this talk about are there more tapes, is  there anything else to discover, journalists are going down that path of inquiry. And so  they came in with, what I would consider kind of a light stunt, which is,  "Hey, we're making our product free for journalists until election day. Have at it, search  for whatever." They were covered for that. So they were able to quickly think about  it, they put up a blog post and they jumped on it, and this is  the story they got in TechCrunch. So, those are a few examples. You saw a  few examples of pitches, and I would say that's your number one tool. You're very  likely not in a place where reporters are kind of sitting on your site, refreshing  your blog wondering what the next news is going to be, so you need to  get to them. Blog post though is helpful to link to just to give extra  information, and to not attach stuff.

这不是每天都有机会，所以这不是你平常的例子。我们都可能记得，去年10月，有一些关于唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)在一辆公共汽车上说脏话的录音带泄露出去，而且，温和地说，这可能是美国乃至全世界的主要新闻。我想这发生在10月8日。另一家YC公司Deepgram，他们的产品基本上是语音搜索，所以他们可以搜索像Google搜索图像这样的音频文件。所以他们看到了一个机会，有更多的录音带，还有什么需要发现的，记者们正在沿着调查的道路前进。于是他们来了，我认为这是一种轻松的特技，那就是，“嘿，我们要让我们的产品免费提供给记者，直到选举日。在它上，搜索任何东西。”他们被掩盖了。所以他们能够迅速地想一想，他们张贴了一篇博文，然后跳上了它，这就是他们在TechCrunch上得到的故事。以上就是几个例子。你看到了几个投球的例子，我想说这是你的头号工具。你很可能不在一个记者坐在你的网站上，刷新你的博客，想知道下一个新闻将会是什么的地方，所以你需要找到他们。尽管博客帖子有助于链接到仅仅提供额外的信息，而不是附加的东西。

It's a good kind of repository for the full  story, to have that if someone is interested they can click through.

这是一个很好的储存库，完整的故事，拥有它，如果有人感兴趣，他们可以点击通过。

I get questions  about press releases. They're not really for startups. That's the truth.

我有关于新闻稿的问题。它们并不是真正适合初创公司的。这是事实。

It's an older medium.  It used to be ... Gosh, it used to be even more intense than this,  I mean, it was like faxes coming into a newsroom. That used to be the  big utility of a press release. And then more recently, it was a good way  to get in Google News, it got you in search results. But Google has wised  up about that a lot, so it doesn't really do that anymore. Your blog has  just as much power to get into the search results as the press release does.  Press releases, if you're going to put them over the wire, cost like ... They  cost a couple thousand dollars. So it's not worth it for a startup. Really they're  a tool for public companies to make disclosures about market-moving news, so that's the main  folks that'll use it.

是一种较老的介质。以前是.。天哪，过去比这更激烈，我是说，就像传真进入新闻编辑室。这曾经是新闻稿的主要用途。而最近，这是一个很好的方式进入谷歌新闻，它让你在搜索结果。但谷歌已经对此做了很多研究，所以它不再这么做了。你的博客有足够的力量进入搜索结果，就像新闻稿一样。新闻稿，如果你要把它们放在电线上，费用就像.他们花了几千美元。所以对于一家初创公司来说，这是不值得的。实际上，它们是上市公司披露市场动态新闻的工具，所以这是主要的使用工具。

I guess the only other exception would be if you are  in an industry that's kind of like an older-fashioned industry, like baking or aviation. Sometimes  a link to a press release on your site can establish credibility for partners, not  press, but partners or other people that you might want to get meetings with, for  lack of other press coverage. So, there's that. Visuals and assets are really great to  include, never as attachments because attachments are annoying. We all know that. Just link to  them, either on your site or at the Dropbox link, because every story will use  a visual anyway. A lot of outlets want to create their own visual for bigger  feature stories, but for a smaller news item, they might just screenshot your website or  find a picture of the founder speaking at some event. But maybe you don't like  that picture, maybe it's not flattering, so I always just say provide your own visuals  so, hopefully, they'll use on of those and you'll be happy.

我想唯一的例外是，如果你所处的行业有点像一个老式的行业，比如烘焙或航空业。有时候，链接到你网站上的新闻稿可以为合作伙伴建立信誉，而不是为媒体建立信誉，但是由于缺乏其他新闻报道，你可能希望与合作伙伴或其他人会面。所以，就是这样。视觉和资产是真正伟大的包括，从来没有作为附件，因为附件是烦人的。我们都知道。只要链接到他们，无论是在你的网站或在Dropbox链接，因为每个故事将使用一个视觉无论如何。很多媒体想要为更大的专题故事创造自己的视觉效果，但对于一个较小的新闻项目，他们可能只是截屏你的网站，或者找到创始人在某个活动中发言的照片。但也许你不喜欢那张照片，也许这并不讨人喜欢，所以我总是说，提供你自己的视觉效果，希望它们能用在上面，你会很高兴的。

I don't know why  I shoved all this in one slide, but the other thing I want to talk  about in terms of official announcements are exclusives versus embargoes, which could be its own  slide about how to really, really, really piss off a reporter. So, listen closely because  this is important. These are two tools that are used in the PR world to  brief a reporter in advance of a news date, so that they can have a  full story ready to go on the day of the news. You can't use them  both together.

我不知道为什么我把所有这些都塞进了一张幻灯片，但我想在官方公告中谈论的另一件事是排他性和禁运，这可能是它自己关于如何真正激怒一个记者的幻灯片。所以，仔细听，因为这很重要。这两种工具在公关世界中被用来在新闻日期之前向记者介绍情况，这样他们就可以在新闻的当天准备好一个完整的故事。你不能把它们都用在一起。

I'm going to talk about them individually. And exclusive is I'm going to  talk to you, you one reporter, just me and you, you're getting the full story  and that's it. You're the only one I'm talking to about this until after you  post your story. And then if someone calls me, I can talk to them, but  they're not going to have the story ready to go, it's yours. That's an exclusive.  It's as serious as a monogamous relationship. You should not mess with an exclusive.

我要单独谈谈他们。独家新闻是我要和你谈谈，你一个记者，只有我和你，你得到了完整的报道，仅此而已。在你发表你的故事之前，你是唯一和我谈论这件事的人。如果有人打电话给我，我可以和他们谈谈，但他们不会让故事准备好，这是你的。这是独家新闻。就像一夫一妻制的关系一样严重。你不应该乱搞独家新闻。

If  you promise to give someone the story, it's theirs. Got it? Okay. An embargo is  if you have bigger news that you think multiple reporters might cover, which is common,  especially for a mid-sized startup that has people who are kind of following their news.  You can reach out and say to each of the reporters, "I have some news.  I'd like to pre-brief you on it. The news is going out on June 15th  at 8:00 AM Pacific. Would you like the news? Will you agree to the embargo?"  And they say yes, they're basically saying, "Give me the news.

如果你答应给别人讲这个故事，那就是他们的了。明白了。好的。禁运是指如果你有更大的新闻，你认为多名记者可能会报道，这是很常见的，特别是对于一个中等规模的初创公司，有一些人在关注他们的新闻。你可以联系每个记者，对他们说：“我有一些消息要告诉你们。我想预先向你们简要介绍一下。新闻将于6月15日上午8：00发布。你想知道这个消息吗？你会同意禁运吗？”他们说是的，他们基本上是在说，“告诉我这个消息。

If I write a  story, I will not publish it until that specific time that you told me." So,  the trick here is usually to make sure you're being really clear in communication with  everyone, because if you send one reporter the wrong time and they post their story  earlier, then there's four reporters who had a story that was all ready but they  were respecting your ask. So, it's kind of a little weird, but these are things  that exist that are tools. And I would say, specifically for an exclusive, it's something  that we use a lot for early-stage startups because if you're reaching out to a  reporter and you have ... The customer story, the one from Thunkable, that was actually  offered as an exclusive. That was kind of an extra carat to say, "Hey, this  is a cool story and we'll give it to you, just you." So, the reporter  then knows, okay, well I can either take my time to actually talk to the  customer, and I'm not racing against the clock because someone else might write it before  I do. So it allows them to take their time, take a breath and write  the story they want. And also it's nice to not have to complete for clicks  on the story with other outlets. That's why it's used as a tool, but just  make sure to respect it and use it carefully. Last of all, listen and be  a source.

如果我写了一篇文章，我要等到你告诉我的那个具体时间才发表。“所以，这里的诀窍通常是确保你和每个人的沟通都很清楚，因为如果你在错误的时间派了一名记者，并且他们提前发布了他们的报道，那么就有四位记者已经准备好了一篇报道，但他们尊重了你的要求。所以，这有点奇怪，但这些都是存在的工具。我想说的是，特别是对于独家报道，这是我们在早期初创公司中经常用到的东西，因为如果你接触到一个记者，你就.顾客的故事，来自Thunable的故事，实际上是作为独家提供的。这是一个额外的克拉说，“嘿，这是一个很酷的故事，我们会给你，只有你。”所以，记者知道了，好吧，我可以花点时间和顾客谈谈，我不是在和时间赛跑，因为别人可能会在我之前写出来。这样他们就可以慢慢来，喘口气，写出他们想要的故事。而且，它也很好，不必完成与其他渠道的故事点击。这就是为什么它被用作工具的原因，但要确保尊重它并小心使用它。最后，倾听并成为一个消息来源。

It's one thing to reach out when you have news, but kind of  on your day-to-day, you're really just following the news and possibly taking opportunities to be  a source. These are just a couple of things you guys know about Google and  RSS feeds. One thing you might not know about is this tool called HARO, it's  Help a Reporter Out, and the website is helpareporter.com.

这是一回事，当你有消息，但在你的日常生活中，你真的只是关注新闻，可能会抓住机会成为一个消息来源。这只是你们对Google和RSS订阅的几点了解。有一件事你可能不知道，就是这个叫做Haro的工具，它是帮助一个记者出去，这个网站是helareporter.com。

It's free, you can subscribe to  it.

它是免费的，你可以订阅它。

It's kind of a lot, you get three emails every day. Basically what is,  reporters will ... They're seeking a source for their story, so they'll actually submit a  request for a source, "Hey, I'm looking for an expert on molecular biology. Deadline is  tomorrow at 5:00 PM Pacific." And so you see that, you're an expert on molecular  biology, so you can actually reply and kind of let them know about yourself and  maybe they can use you as a source. So, it's a good way. Sometimes you  can really strike it big and there's something right on the money, but it's not  a guaranteed road to coverage. Also some reporters will tweet when they need a source.  They'll say, "Hey, I'm looking for someone who's an expert on this." That's another way.  Also a lot of reporters will tweet their own coverage. So again, if you're reading  a reporter's coverage and kind of understanding what motivates them to write or what types  of stories are cool for them. Twitter's a great place to hang out as well.  A couple of quick examples of being a good source. The one I always talk  about is Sam Altman, having worked with him. He just wanted to help out because  he was just interested in the story. And so this is kind of the true  test of a founder who gets PR from me, is someone who just thinks the  story is cool, someone who actually wants reporters to have the tools to put out  a great story, so he would reach out even if something wasn't in the realm  of Loopt.

你每天都会收到三封邮件。基本上，记者会.他们正在为他们的故事寻找一个消息来源，所以他们会提交一个消息来源的请求，“嘿，我在找一位分子生物学专家。截止日期是明天下午5点太平洋。”所以你看到了，你是分子生物学的专家，所以你可以回答，让他们知道你自己，也许他们可以把你作为一个来源。所以这是个好办法。有时候你真的可以大打出手，而且钱上也有一些东西，但这并不是一条有保障的保险之路。还有一些记者在需要消息来源时会发推特。他们会说，“嘿，我在找一个专家。”那是另一种方式。还有很多记者会在推特上发表自己的报道。所以，如果你读到了一位记者的报道，并且理解了他们写作的动机，或者什么类型的故事对他们来说很酷的话。Twitter也是一个不错的地方。几个快速的例子是一个很好的来源。我一直在谈论的那个人是山姆·奥特曼，他曾和他共事过。他只是想帮忙，因为他对这个故事很感兴趣。因此，这是对一个从我那里获得公关的创始人的真正考验，他认为这个故事很酷，一个真正想让记者拥有发布一个伟大故事的工具的人，所以即使有什么东西不在Loopt的领域，他也会伸出援手。

If there was a story about augmented reality or something, he would ping  someone and say, "Hey, I'm really interested in augmented reality.

如果有关于增强现实之类的故事，他会对别人说：“嘿，我真的对增强现实感兴趣。

I know a lot about  it." And they would call him even though there wasn't a specific Loopt tie-in. That  was a way that he was there for them, so when we did have news,  they at least looked at the email.

我知道很多。“而且他们会打电话给他，即使没有一个具体的Loopt绑定。这是他在那里支持他们的一种方式，所以当我们有消息时，他们至少看了电子邮件。

It helped just kind of get that credibility,  because they knew he was interested in them getting a good story. Two recent examples  from Penny, another YC company in a recent batch. This New York Times example was  Penny saw this comment that Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of Chase, made about innovative  big startups not holding a candle to the offerings that Chase had for their own  customers, and was kind of crapping on innovative banking startups. And it wasn't widely covered,  it was only covered in a couple of places ... They saw it in Forbes.  And they noticed the New York Times hadn't covered it, and there was a specific  reporter who they had been continuing to read his coverage, Ron at the New York  Times, Ron Lieber, and they felt like Ron would be interested in the story, yet  he hadn't covered it. So they reached out to him and said, "Hey, have you  seen this news of what Jamie Dimon said? Here's what we think about it. We  think that innovative startups do have a place and we have this perspective, and I'm  an expert in this." And so he was able to jump on the phone with  a reporter, give him context and what he thought, and he was in the story  in the second paragraph and quoted twice. So this story that he wouldn't have been  in probably ...

因为他们知道他对他们的故事很感兴趣。最近的两个例子来自Penny，另一家YC公司，最近一批。“纽约时报”的这个例子是Penny看到了这样的评论：Chase的首席执行官杰米·戴蒙(Jamie Dimon)说，创新型的大型初创企业没有为蔡斯为自己的客户提供的服务守口如瓶，而是在某种程度上依赖于创新的银行初创企业。它没有被广泛覆盖，只是覆盖在几个地方.他们在福布斯上看到了。他们注意到“纽约时报”没有报道，还有一个特定的记者，他们一直在读他的报道，“纽约时报”的罗恩·利伯，他们觉得罗恩会对这篇报道感兴趣，但他并没有报道。于是他们向他伸出手说：“嘿，你看过杰米·戴蒙说的这个新闻吗？我们是这么想的。我们认为创新的初创企业确实有一席之地，我们有这样的视角，而我是这方面的专家。”所以他可以和一位记者打电话，告诉他的背景和他的想法，他在第二段的故事中被引用了两次。所以这个他可能不会参与的故事.

If the reporter had picked it up on his own, he probably  wouldn't have been in it, but he was in it because he was able to  kind of guide the reporter through, or at least help him get to a place  where he wanted to write about it. And the other thing that Penny worked on  is they had talked to a Bloomberg reporter about chatbots because she had written a  story about that, and they wanted to kind of give her some more experience ...  I guess I didn't really say what Penny did. They're a personal finance app, so  it's like a personal finance coach in your pocket and it's a bot ... So  they were talking to her about bots and she mentioned to them there were two  stories she was working on, one about equity, grants, and one about diversity hiring.

如果记者自己捡到的话，他可能不会在里面，但他在里面，是因为他能引导记者，或者至少能帮他找到一个他想写的地方。佩妮做的另一件事是，他们和彭博记者谈过关于聊天机器人的事，因为她写了一篇关于这个的文章，他们想给她一些更多的经验.我想我没说佩妮做了什么。它们是个人金融应用，所以它就像你口袋里的个人理财教练，它是一个机器人.所以他们和她谈论机器人，她向他们提到了两个故事，一个是关于公平，赠款，另一个是关于多样性招聘。

It  was just kind of conversation, but they realized they had a friend who know a  lot about equity grants so they connected her to the friend, and that was just  kind of a nice gesture they did. And then when they were starting to look  for their first engineering hire, these two male founders with an app called Penny and  a female bot wanted to hire a female engineer to help to balance out their  company from the beginning. They reached out to her and said, "Hey, I know you  were interested in this, we're actually doing this now. Anyway, hope you're having a good  day. That's what we're doing." So she got back with them and said, "Hey, I  want to profile you through your whole hiring process." So she shadowed them through this  in-depth podcast on their hiring process. So, this wasn't the story that they dreamt of  in Bloomberg probably, a story about their hiring process verus their business, but it was  a great way to develop this relationship with this reporter. The piece ended up turning  out really great. They did end up making a hire. This to me is just  a good example of a founder that gets a good story and will invest in  just kind of making that happen. So, this is kind of it. The other tools  that you have are responding to articles.

这只是一种交谈，但他们意识到，他们有一个朋友，他对股权捐赠非常了解，所以他们把她和他的朋友联系起来，这是他们做的一个很好的姿态。然后，当他们开始寻找第一批工程人员时，这两位拥有一款名为Penny的应用程序的男性创始人和一位女性机器人想要雇佣一名女性工程师，从一开始就帮助平衡他们的公司。他们向她伸出手说：“嘿，我知道你对这件事很感兴趣，我们现在真的在做这件事。不管怎样，希望你今天过得愉快。这就是我们要做的。”于是她又回来跟他们说：“嘿，我想在你的整个招聘过程中介绍你的情况。”所以她通过这个深度播客来跟踪他们的招聘过程。所以，这并不是他们在彭博社(Bloomberg)梦寐以求的故事，也许是关于他们的招聘流程的报道，但这是与这位记者发展这种关系的好方法。这首曲子的结局非常棒。他们最终得到了一份工作。对我来说，这只是一个很好的例子，一个创始人得到了一个很好的故事，并将投资在某种程度上实现这一目标。所以，这就是其中之一。您所拥有的其他工具正在响应文章。

If there's an article that you might even  disagree with or have a different point of view, that's another opportunity to reach out.  It's not always just news-driven or trend-driven, it could just be, "Hey, you wrote this.  I don't know if you ever thought about this way. Anyway, if you ever want  to explore this side, let me know, I'm here." Also, the media's changing. Getting an  article written about you isn't the only way for someone to start seeing you as  an authority. There are small things you can do like commentate on an article, not  self-promotional, not plugging your business in any big way, but just as an interested person  in this topic. Commenting on a article on reddit, Quora, and even creating your own  content on your blog or on Medium, these are good ways to start just kind  of dipping your toe and establishing your credibility in the field that you operate in.  So, those are some small things that you can do. Questions? Actually, as a surprise,  we have Steven Levy here, who is at Backchannel ... Come on up, Steven ...  and formerly at WIRED, and Newsweek way back. He's a surprise, but this a journalist.  You can ask questions to him as well. You can either ask me or the  person who's on the other line of these questions.

如果有一篇文章你甚至可能不同意或者有不同的观点，那是另一次接触的机会。它并不总是新闻驱动的或者趋势驱动的，可能只是，“嘿，这是你写的。我不知道你有没有想过这样做。不管怎么说，如果你想探索这一面，请告诉我，我在这里。”而且媒体也在改变。写一篇关于你的文章并不是别人开始视你为权威的唯一途径。有些小事情你可以做，比如对一篇文章的评论，而不是自我推销，不以任何大的方式推销你的事业，而只是作为一个对这个话题感兴趣的人。评论一篇关于Reddit，Quora，甚至在你的博客或媒体上创建你自己的内容的文章，这些都是开始尝试一下你的脚趾，在你所从事的领域建立你的可信度的好方法。所以，这些都是你可以做的小事情。问题？事实上，令人惊讶的是，我们这里有史蒂文·莱维，他在后渠道.上来，史蒂文.。以前在“连线”和“新闻周刊”工作很久以前。他是个惊喜但这是个记者。你也可以问他问题。你可以问我或者其他人的问题。

Steven: And actually this is a super clueful presentation, I have to say.

史蒂文：事实上，我不得不说，这是一个非常愚蠢的演讲。

Sharon: Thank you, Steven.

莎伦：谢谢你，史蒂文。

Steven: And you don't hear that from all people in the PR industry.

史蒂文：你不是从公关行业的所有人那里听到的。

Sharon: I think that's true, yeah.

莎伦：是的，我认为这是真的。

Steven: So, very good.

史蒂文：那么，非常好。

Sharon: We do have a question back there.

莎伦：我们后面有个问题。

Participant 2: I was just trying to understand the advantages of the exclusive versus non-exclusive.

参与者2：我只是想了解排他性和非排他性的优点。

I imagined  that being non-exclusive could potentially lead to more press, at least in the case of  Thunkable , so there's getting a better story. But what are some of the other  advantages of doing exclusive?
Sharon: Steven, do you need me to repeat the question?
Steven: Yes.

我曾想过，非排他性可能会带来更多的媒体，至少在Thunable的情况下是这样，所以有一个更好的故事。但是，做排他性的其他一些优势是什么呢？莎伦：史蒂文，你需要我重复这个问题吗？史蒂文：是的。

Sharon: Repeat it. So the question is what are the advantages of doing an exclusive verus  an embargo, because what your understanding was that if you do an embargo, you get  more stories?
Steven: Sure, I'm dealing with this a lot. For what I do, I much prefer exclusives.  The publication I founded and write for called Backchannel is we don't do a lot  of stories, we're not a trade publication like TechCrunch, so we're not going to cover  everything. We cover things that are special and we can tell things in depth. For  us, it's important to have an exclusive. We don't want to write the generic story  that everyone else writes there. And the other problem with embargoes is that ... First  off, what you have has to be important to get a lot of reporters involved  in there for a non-exclusive story. What often happens is that someone gets wind of  it and then someone will tweet, "Oh, there's a company that does X," and there's  four reporters sitting there with the story. And one of them will have an editor  that says, "That's it, the embargo's broken. Let's jut go with it." I would say  well over half of the embargoes I've ever been involved with get broken and there's  bad feelings-
Sharon: I would have said 25%.

莎伦：重复一遍。所以问题是，实行禁运的好处是什么？因为你的理解是，如果你实施禁运，你会得到更多的故事？史蒂文：当然，我经常处理这件事。就我所做的而言，我更喜欢独占。我创建并为之撰写的出版物叫做BackChannel，我们不做很多故事，我们不是像TechCrunch这样的行业出版物，所以我们不会涵盖所有的东西。我们报道一些特别的事情，我们可以深入地讲述一些事情。对我们来说，有一个独家新闻是很重要的。我们不想写其他人写的一般故事。禁运的另一个问题是.。首先，要让很多记者参与到非独家报道中，你必须做的是很重要的事情。经常发生的情况是，有人听说了这件事，然后就会在推特上发推文，“哦，有一家公司做了X”，有四名记者坐在那里报道这个故事。其中一位编辑会说：“就是这样，禁运已经被打破了。让我们一起去吧。”我会说，我参与过的禁运中，有一半以上都被打破了，而且感觉很糟糕-莎伦：我会说25%。

Steven: I say over half. And my pet peeve is always that if a big publication  like Businessweek or The New York Times breaks an embargo, sometimes accidentally, "We thought it  was West Coast time," or something like that, they never suffer consequences there.

史蒂文：我说一半以上。我最不高兴的是，如果像“商业周刊”或“纽约时报”这样的大型出版物违反了禁运，有时会意外地说，“我们以为是西海岸时间”之类的，他们永远不会在那里承受后果。

If you  have an important story to tell, and particularly if it's a complex story that can't  be summed up neatly in a sentence but what you have is really cool and  needs explanation, then you really want an exclusive story, a reporter who's going to find  it worthwhile to spend a lot of time with you and your company and tell  that definitive story. You put it on the web, everyone gets to read it. For  example, I did this story about this company called Viv, which was people who used  to do the Siri product there.

如果你有一个重要的故事要讲，特别是如果它是一个复杂的故事，不能用一个句子简单地概括，但是你所拥有的东西真的很酷，需要解释的话，那么你真的想要一篇独家报道，一个会发现花很多时间和你的公司在一起的记者，并讲述那个确定的故事。你把它放到网上，每个人都能读到。例如，我写了一个关于这个叫做Viv的公司的故事，它是过去在那里做Siri产品的人。

I did it for WIRED.

我这么做是为了“连线”。

It was actually my  last story in the magazine, until this week actually.

这实际上是我在杂志上的最后一篇报道，直到本周。

It was a couple of years  ago. They actually used that on their website to explain themselves for a couple of  years.

那是几年前的事了。他们在他们的网站上用这个解释了几年。

Sharon: Yeah, it's kind of ... And I think that's the key point about exclusives.

莎伦：是的，有点.我认为这是排他性的关键点。

If  someone can go deeper, then as a business that's a tool for you.

如果有人能走得更深，那么作为一家企业，这对你来说是一种工具。

It's part  of the tapestry of your company.

这是你公司挂毯的一部分。

It's kind of the top of the search results.  It's something that someone can actually take and read and fall in love with your  company, especially for recruiting, partnerships. That story's in your email signature and you can really  cherish it.

这是搜索结果的顶端。这是一个人可以接受、阅读并爱上你的公司的东西，尤其是在招聘、合作伙伴关系方面。这个故事在你的电子邮件签名中，你可以很珍惜它。

I think there's a question right behind you.

我想你后面有个问题。

Participant 3: Steven, could you sort of go through some of the major different types of publications.  There is TechCrunch, there is New York Times and sort of mainstream media, but then  there's the new wave of media companies on Medium, and then there's there's all these  different types, could you sort of go through the pros and cons to the different  major categories that you see?
Steven: Yeah, sure. Ultimately, when you're going to do your pitch, you're going to do what  Sharon says and really get yourself familiar with them. The larger distinctions is that a  publication like TechCrunch considers itself almost definitive to say anything important in the industry, we're  going to do.

参与者3：史蒂文，你能看看一些主要的不同类型的出版物吗？有TechCrunch，有“纽约时报”，也有一些主流媒体，但是接下来是媒体公司的新浪潮，然后是所有这些不同的类型，你能看一下不同的主要类别吗？史蒂文：是的，当然。最终，当你要做你的演讲时，你会按照莎伦的话去做，让自己真正熟悉它们。更大的区别是，像TechCrunch这样的出版物认为自己几乎可以肯定地说出行业中任何重要的东西，我们将这样做。

I don't know if YC still does this, but when I last  did a dive in a batch, they had almost an informal relationship that the company's  time came, TechCrunch would basically run their verbal press release. They'd have a call scheduled  and someone would read it out.

我不知道YC是否还在这么做，但当我最后一次大批量潜水时，他们几乎有了一段非正式的关系，公司的时代到了，TechCrunch基本上会发布他们的口头新闻稿。他们会安排一个电话，有人会把它念出来。

I don't know if there were so many companies  there-
Sharon: Yeah, there's so many more companies, but it's a top target for a lot of  YC companies.

我不知道那里是否有那么多公司-莎伦：是的，还有那么多公司，但这是很多YC公司的首要目标。

Steven: Because they're going to do a lot of stuff there, and they're interested in the  business. Traditional publications, again, they're not going to do as much. They're going to figure  out is this significant in a business sense or a technology sense, in which case  actually you might have to consider a different reporter for one of those publications there.  If your company is an AI company, you're going to talk to the person who  covers AI, as opposed to the retail thing if you're a commerce company. A lot  of the newer publications ... My publication started on Medium. We started actually as part  of Medium. Again, lots of different kinds of stuff. Some of them are really focused  on what startup life is like, in which case you might have something unique to  offer. We do a thing in my publication, because a lot of people in this  community read us, called War Stories.

史蒂文：因为他们会在那里做很多事情，而且他们对生意很感兴趣。传统的出版物，再一次，他们不会做那么多。他们会发现这在商业意义上或者技术意义上是很重要的，在这种情况下，你可能需要为其中的一篇文章考虑另一位记者。如果你的公司是一家人工智能公司，你会和负责人工智能的人交谈，而如果你是一家商业公司的话，你就会与零售公司的情况相反。很多较新的出版物.。我的出版物是从媒体开始的。我们实际上是作为媒介的一部分开始的。再说一遍，有很多不同的东西。他们中的一些人真正关注的是创业生活是什么样的，在这种情况下，你可能会有一些独特的东西可以提供。我们在我的出版物上做了一件事，因为这个社区里有很多人读到我们，叫做战争故事。

If someone has a really interesting story to tell  about what they do ... Typically, actually it's people who've already established themselves and talk  about at a crucial part in the formation of their company. Even so, some of  the younger companies I've seen there has stories interesting enough. We did one with ...  what's it ...

如果有人有一个非常有趣的故事来讲述他们所做的事情.通常情况下，实际上是那些已经建立了自己的公司的人，在公司的形成过程中谈论到了关键的部分。即便如此，我在那里看到的一些年轻公司的故事还是很有趣的。我们和.。怎么了.。

Instaart-
Sharon: Instacart?
Steven: instaart, the art that does Chris Chan, a guy we somehow captivated with. He was  this young guy from Detroit who wound up being a sole founder, did a few  pivots and wound up to have these people in Hong Kong create paintings based on  your photographs. Do you remember that company?
Participant 4: Instapainting.

英斯塔特-莎伦：伊斯塔卡特？史蒂文：举个例子，克里斯·陈的艺术，一个让我们着迷的家伙。他是一位来自底特律的年轻人，他最终成为了唯一的创办人，他做了几个支点，最后让这些人在香港根据你的照片创作绘画。你还记得那家公司吗？参与者4：Instapainting。

Steven: Instapainting, yeah. And I followed him, he was helpful ... Again, it's the source thing.  He was helpful to me talking about his life as a startup when I did  a story about that batch, and then later I was connected with him and wound  up writing about his company.

史蒂文：Instapainting，是的。我跟着他，他很有帮助.。再说一次，这是源头。当我写了一篇关于那批人的故事时，他对我谈论他的创业生涯很有帮助，后来我和他建立了联系，最后写了关于他公司的文章。

Sharon: That's great. Just to add on to the TechCrunch element too. When companies are in  YC, often times their goal after YC is to get investment, which is why TechCrunch  tends to be their top target.

莎伦：那太好了。也只是为了添加到TechCrunch元素。当公司进入YC时，他们的目标往往是在YC之后获得投资，这就是TechCrunch往往是他们的首要目标的原因。

It's not every company that has that as their  top target, but if you think about who's your audience, if your audience is investors,  maybe the outlet is TechCrunch.

并不是每一家公司都把这作为他们的首要目标，但如果你考虑到谁是你的受众，如果你的受众是投资者，也许出路是TechCrunch。

Participant 5: So I was wondering about the benefits of kind of reaching out to reporters versus  generating your own PR with Medium articles or Twitter, basically other forms of social media.  Do you feel like you really need to kind of reach out to reporters to  kind of generate the publicity that you might like?
Sharon: The question is how would you weigh reaching out to reporters against things you can  do yourself like writing media articles and being active on social media? I'm sure you  have an opinion. My opinion is pretty brief.

参与者5：所以我想知道接触记者与用媒体文章或Twitter(基本上是其他形式的社交媒体)产生自己的公关相比有什么好处。你觉得你真的需要向记者伸出援手，才能产生你可能喜欢的宣传吗？雪伦：问题是，你如何权衡与记者接触，反对你自己可以做的事情，比如写媒体文章和活跃在社交媒体上？我相信你有自己的看法。我的意见很简短。

It's that they're not mutually exclusive.

而是它们不是相互排斥的。

I  think that your story through your voice is amazing, and if you're able to start  developing content that's on-point for your customers and for people who follow your company, that's  amazing, and that's helpful for SEO. So from a pure business standpoint, it's helpful, but  it's also great to create a dialogue where you can actually answer your customers' problems.  The other thing that's helpful is to have a third party validate your business by  thinking it's cool and writing a piece on it.

我认为你的故事通过你的声音是惊人的，如果你能够开始开发的内容是对你的客户和跟踪你的公司的人，这是惊人的，这是有益的搜索引擎优化。因此，从纯粹的商业角度来看，这是有帮助的，但也是很好的建立一个对话，你可以真正回答你的客户的问题。另一件有用的事情是让第三方通过认为你的生意很酷并在上面写一篇文章来验证你的业务。

Steven: That's generally right, but if everything is out in a Medium story, it's a little  less delicious for a reporter to do that.

史蒂文：一般是对的，但如果一切都在媒体报道中，那么对于一个记者来说，这样做就不那么美味了。

I did a story about a startup  called Bonsai recently, and interestingly that came from a relationship I had with a PR  person who really knows my work and knows, okay, this is a guy who likes  to do things that really move the ball, and this is something different there that  I think is going to meet Steven's needs. And they had done some stuff on  Medium and I looked hard at that to say, "Boy, did they give the story  away," even though if you just put up stuff on Medium, you're not necessarily ...  it would have to be pretty rare to get huge readership from that.

我最近写了一篇关于一家名为“盆景”的初创公司的故事，有趣的是，这是我和一位公关人员的关系，他非常了解我的工作，知道，这是一个喜欢做一些真正能打动人心的事情的人，我认为这是另一回事，我认为这会满足史蒂文的需求。他们在媒体上做了一些事情，我仔细地看了看，说：“孩子，他们有没有把故事泄露出去？”即使你只是把东西放在媒体上，你也不一定.要想从这方面获得大量读者，那将是非常罕见的。

I say  ultimately then it doesn't really matter, not many people have read it. But if you  got what you wanted and it took off, if might make a reporter think twice  to say, "Gee, that story's been told already."
Sharon: I think that might have blown past the common sense point of the big part  of news is that it's new, that someone hasn't talked about it yet, and that's  the compelling point for reporters. Any other questions?
Participant 6: Can you talk about the balance between sort of crafting and scaffolding a story that  you directly give to reporters verus letting them do what they want with it based  on one hand it's less work for them, but on the other hand they sort  of exercise less creativity if you give them a narrative they can copy and paste  into their article?
Sharon: So the question is, and I'm going to ask Steven to answer it, is what's  the balance between doing a lot of pre-work and giving kind of an outline to  a reporter ... As you said, scaffolding ... Versus just letting a reporter run with  it?
Steven: Well, I mean, you're going to need focus to explain what it is, but once  the things get rolling, the reporter is going to want to take his or her  take on the thing there. Reporters just don't like being directed or saying, "This is  our story, don't pay attention to that." Once you open the door, we're in.

我说最终它并不重要，没有多少人读过它。但是，如果你得到了你想要的，它起飞了，如果可能让一名记者三思而后说，“哎呀，这个故事已经被说了。”莎伦：我认为这可能已经超出了大部分新闻的常识点，那就是它是新的，有人还没有谈论它，这对记者来说是很有吸引力的。还有其他问题吗？参与者6：你能谈谈手工艺和脚手架之间的平衡吗？一个你直接给记者的故事，让他们用它做他们想做的事情，这一方面减少了他们的工作量，另一方面，如果你给他们一个他们可以复制和粘贴到他们文章中的叙述，他们的创造力就会减少一些？莎伦：所以问题是，我要请史蒂文来回答这个问题，在做大量的前期工作和给一个记者一个大致的大纲之间有什么平衡？。就像你说的脚手架.。而不是让记者带着它跑？史蒂文：嗯，我的意思是，你需要集中精力来解释它是什么，但是一旦事情开始发展，记者就会想要对那里的事情采取他或她的看法。记者只是不喜欢被指示或说，“这是我们的故事，不要注意。”一旦你打开门，我们就进去了。

I  hope what you want to say is interesting enough to keep us from what we  find interesting.

我希望你想说的话足够有趣，以免我们发现有趣的东西。

Sharon: I think pre-work is helpful, at least in my getting responses from folks, because you  have to make sure they get that it's a cool story. So just saying this  is my company, your thoughts, is maybe not going to be enough. You need to  talk to them about the cool thing you're doing that they might be interested in.  And it also brings up another point that there are no rewrites. So the reporter  gets to have their time with your story and you don't get to review a  draft or edit it, which I know seems common sense, but it is a question  I get a lot. Any other questions? Okay. Thank you. Thank you to our surprise  guest, Steven Levy.


莎伦：我认为工作前的工作是有帮助的，至少在我得到人们的回应方面是这样，因为你必须确保他们知道这是一个很酷的故事。所以说这是我的公司，你的想法，也许是不够的。你需要和他们谈谈你正在做的，他们可能感兴趣的事。它还提出了另外一点，即没有重写。因此，记者可以花时间看你的报道，而你却没有机会审查或编辑一份草稿，我知道这似乎是常识，但这是一个我经常遇到的问题。还有其他问题吗？好的。谢谢。感谢我们的惊喜嘉宾史蒂文·莱维。
