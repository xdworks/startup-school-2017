# How to Find Product Market Fit - Peter Reinhardt

Speaker 1: Today we have Peter Reinhardt. He's the CEO of Segment, went through YC ... When?
Peter : 2011.

演讲者1：今天我们有彼得·莱因哈特。他是Segment的首席执行官，通过了YC.什么时候彼得：2011年。

Speaker 1: 2011. Now Segment is doing extremely well. Peter is going to talk about product market  fit, this magic concept where people don't really understand it. Certainly the first job to  get right in any start up. Peter, thank you very much for coming to talk  to us and look forward to hearing this.

发言者1：2011。现在分部做得非常好。彼得将谈论产品市场适合，这个神奇的概念，人们并不真正理解它。当然，这是第一份在任何初创公司都能胜任的工作。彼得，非常感谢你来和我们谈话，并期待着听到这个消息。

Peter : I'm going to talk about finding product market fit. Segment is a Be to Be  company so that's probably why none of you have ever heard of us but just  to give you a little sense, we're about 150 people and grew from about four  people three and a half years ago. Growing quickly and hopefully I can shed some  light on finding product market fit for you.

彼得：我要谈谈如何找到合适的产品市场。这可能是你们中没有人听说过我们的原因，但为了给你们一点感觉，我们大约有150人，从三年半前的四人增长到现在。增长迅速，希望我能为您找到适合您的产品市场提供一些信息。

I thought just start by looking back  to Alan Kay's lecture.

我想从回顾艾伦·凯的演讲开始吧。

I think he had some pretty incredible advice on how to  do really amazing research by looking into the future and imagining what that future might  be like.

我认为他对于如何通过展望未来和想象未来的未来做真正令人惊奇的研究提出了一些非常令人难以置信的建议。

In particular, he had this diagram of exploring the pink plain and testing  out different ideas there and then at some point having a break through and realizing  that there's a blue plain and you can go explore an entirely new space and  that that's a key break through for understanding how you can really invent that future.  In particular, he had this idea of going into the future and imagining yourself there.  He had this Wayne Gretzky idea of skating to where the puck should be or  will be and going there, grabbing that future and then pulling it back to the  present. The way that he talks about doing this is I think amazing for research.  He talks about basically going and imagining that future world but I'd actually wager that  not a single successful company has been founded by doing that.

特别是，他有一张图，在那里探索粉色平原并测试不同的想法，然后在某个时候有了突破，意识到有一个蓝色的平原，你可以去探索一个全新的空间，这是一个关键的突破，你可以理解你如何才能真正创造那个未来。特别是，他有这样的想法：进入未来，想象自己在那里。他有这样的想法：滑到冰球应该或者将要去的地方，然后去那里，抓住那个未来，然后把它拉回到现在。他谈论这件事的方式，我觉得这对研究来说是惊人的。他谈到的基本上是去想象未来的世界，但实际上我敢打赌，没有一家成功的公司是这样创建的。

I think again, awesome  for research but when it comes to founding companies, it actually has nothing to do  with imagining your vision for the future and what that future could be.

我再一次认为，这对研究来说很棒，但当涉及到创建公司时，它实际上与想象你对未来的愿景以及未来可能是什么毫无关系。

It's not  about how you wish the world was but it's actually about what customers want.

问题不在于你希望世界是怎样的，而在于客户想要什么。

I  think a lot of companies get marketed post facto of hey, we have this great  idea and here's how we deductively logic'ed out what customers were going to want and  then we built the thing but in reality, that's not how it works at all.  In reality, it's a very inductive process. You're going back and forth with customers and  you eventually find something that works.

我认为很多公司都是事后推销的，嘿，我们有一个很棒的想法，这是我们演绎出客户想要什么的逻辑，然后我们制造了这个东西，但实际上，这根本不是它的工作方式。实际上，这是一个非常归纳的过程。你和客户来回往来，最终你会发现一些有用的东西。

I wanted to talk a little bit about that  process today and just how critical it is and actually how difficult it is too.  One of the most common mistakes that start ups make is to build something that  no one wants or solve problems that no one has and so that Wayne Gretzky  method for going into the future and imagining what that future might look like, again,  it's a good idea for research, it might even be a good idea for venture  capitalist, to imagine what the future is like and put start ups into different buckets  of what building that future might look at but I actually think it's a bad  strategy for founders. The reason is that most founders can actually pretty easily build something  that looks like it's from the future or is from the future to some extent  like it's easy to solve the technology problem there but it's actually really difficult.

今天我想谈一谈这个过程，它有多重要，实际上也有多困难。创业公司最常见的错误之一是建立一个没有人想要或解决问题的东西，这样韦恩·格雷茨基(WayneGretzky)就可以预测未来，想象未来会是什么样子，这也是一个研究的好主意，对风险投资家来说甚至可能是一个很好的想法，去想象未来会是什么样子。就像把创业公司放进不同的桶里，看看未来可能会看到什么，但我认为这对创始人来说是个糟糕的策略。原因是，大多数创始人实际上可以很容易地构建一些看起来像是来自未来的东西，或者从某种程度上说，解决技术问题是很容易的，但这实际上是非常困难的。

It's  not really what you need to do. You don't need to build something that is  your vision of the future, you actually need to solve a specific problem that customers  have today, here, now. Most start ups actually fail to do that. Most start ups  actually build something that looks vaguely futuristic but is not in fact a real problem  that people have today.

这并不是你真正需要做的。你不需要建立一个你对未来的愿景，你实际上需要解决客户今天、这里、现在所面临的一个具体问题。实际上，大多数初创企业都没有做到这一点。大多数创业公司实际上建立的东西看上去模糊未来主义，但实际上并不是一个真正的问题，今天的人们。

It'll kill the company every time. The market always wins. We're  going to dig into that a little bit more and this problem of finding product  market fit stat 80%, 80% of all founders failed to find product market fit so  four out of five attempts to found a company just fail at this earlier stage  of even finding a problem that you can solve in a unique way. The last  one out of five, we're going to struggle through the remainder of actually building that  company up from there but that's just the stats.

每次都会毁了公司。市场总是赢的。我们要进一步研究这个问题最后一个五个中的一个，我们将努力通过其余的实际建设的公司，从那里，但这只是统计数字。

I'll share our own story of  finding product market fit but the short version is that it actually feels when you're  not finding product market fit.

我将分享我们自己的故事，寻找产品市场适合，但短期的版本是，它实际上是感觉，当你没有找到产品市场适合。

It feels like a bottomless, emotionless, freefall, not to get  too dark. When you're failing to find it, it becomes a strange obsession and it  could really make you sick actually. To get a little maybe too personal for a  second, in 2012, in the midst of our search for product market fit, I lost  10 pounds in three weeks and went to the hospital twice for panic attacks.

这感觉就像一个无底洞，无感情，自由落体，不要太黑暗。当你找不到它的时候，它变成了一种奇怪的困扰，它真的会让你生病。在2012年，在我们寻找合适的产品市场的过程中，我在三周内减掉了10磅，两次因恐慌症而去了医院。

I  haven't had a panic attack before or since then and I think it's not just  me actually.

在此之前或之后，我都没有经历过恐慌症发作，我认为这不仅仅是我自己。

I think Sam, I don't know if I should show this or not  but when he was founding Looped, I think he basically forgot to eat properly and  ended up with Scurvy. Sam's back there somewhere. Be warned, finding product market fit is  very emotionally a grind. The reason it is is that you really, really desperately want  to find that fit. You really want to figure out what is going to work.  What is something that customers want. We're all wired to want to succeed to help  people like that. You're so intent on finding this thing that you convince yourself into  seeing mirages of it. You convince yourself this is the thing, we're almost there. This  is something that people really want. This is a picture of myself with my three  co-founders, Ilya, Calvin and Ian, in the summer of 2012 I think and this is  in the midst of our deepest false hopes that we had found something. We'll dive  into that story. Obviously I'm here to day because it worked out.

我想萨姆，我不知道我该不该展示这个，但是当他创立的时候，我认为他基本上忘了吃东西，最后得了坏血病。萨姆在后面的某个地方。请注意，找到合适的产品市场是非常痛苦的情绪。原因是你真的非常想找到合适的人选。你真的想弄清楚什么能起作用。顾客想要什么。我们都渴望成功去帮助这样的人。你如此专注于寻找这件事，以至于你说服自己去看到它的幻影。你说服自己这就是问题所在，我们就快到了。这是人们真正想要的东西。这是我和我的三位联合创始人Ilya，Calvin和Ian在2012年夏天的一张照片，我想这是在我们内心深处的虚假希望中，我们发现了一些东西。我们会深入研究那个故事。很明显我今天在这里是因为一切顺利。

I wouldn't be  speaking if we just disappeared into the darkness. Today we're about 150 in and growing  rapidly.

如果我们消失在黑暗里我就不会说话了。今天，我们大约有150人进入并迅速发展。

Speaker 3: How can you make sure you're finding the big market and not just a small  niche
Peter : That's a good question.

演讲者3：如何确保你找到的是大市场，而不仅仅是一个小利基，彼得：这是个好问题。

I think PG's advice on this is good and valid which  is it's actually harder to find the first problem and solve any problem well than  to find a route out so finding a route out from some initial foothold into  a broad market is actually not that hard. Sounds hard but once you find any  foothold, you can pretty much find something and I can cover that a little bit  in a bit.

我认为PG在这方面的建议是好的，也是有效的。实际上，要找到第一个问题和解决任何问题都要比找到一条路线要困难得多，所以从某个初始位置找到一条通往广阔市场的路线其实并不难。听起来很难，但一旦你找到了立足点，你就能找到一些东西，而我可以在一小段时间内解决这个问题。

Speaker 3: Is that because you have more leverage
Peter : It turns that once you solve a problem for a customer, they'll keep bringing you  more problems. The most efficient thing for them to do is just say well I  have this other problem that's also adjacent to it, can you solve that? You're like  oh, sure.

演讲者3：因为你有更多的筹码，彼得：一旦你为客户解决了一个问题，他们就会给你带来更多的问题。对他们来说，最有效的方法就是说，我还有另外一个问题，就在它旁边，你能解决这个问题吗？你就像哦，当然。

I'll solve that and you keep solving adjacent problems. Once you find one  thing, it's actually almost trivial to find the next thing and the next thing and  the next thing especially selling to other business where you have someone who can just  tell you more stuff. Much harder in consumer, I'm the wrong guy to talk to  about consumer stuff.

我来解决，你继续解决附近的问题。一旦你找到了一件事，找到下一件事和下一件事几乎是微不足道的，特别是卖给其他的生意，在那里你有一个人可以告诉你更多的东西。更难的是，在消费者方面，我是一个错误的人谈论消费者的东西。

I don't get it. Back then, we're just four dudes in an  apartment. We're failing to find product market fit. We were convincing ourselves that maybe we  had it or we were on the cusp of it and we were writing a  lot of code.

我还是不明白在那时候，我们只是一个公寓里的四个男人。我们找不到合适的产品市场。我们正在说服自己，也许我们已经拥有了它，或者我们正处于它的尖端，我们正在编写大量的代码。

I saw someone who was writing code. We were writing a lot  of code and we had no customers. That's the wrong order of operations and so  we were tricking ourselves into this and in reality, what the good thing that was  going on here, the reality was that we were a bunch of cockroaches and the  reason is that it's very important, pre product market fit to save as much cash  as possible, spend as little as possible and extend your runways as long as possible.  A lot of founders make a mistake of spending a bunch on sales or marketing  or other things as soon as they have an idea but in reality, until you  find product market fit, until you find something that people want, you shouldn't be spending  any time on that. You should just be spending time talking with customers and iterating  and you really want to constrain your runway or constrain your burns so you can  have a really long runway. That's what we did. We kept our burn really low.  I think we paid ourselves the minimum allowable amount by law which was 20 or  30k a year. We lived in our apartment/office. The company paid for part of it  as an office.

我看到有人在写代码。我们写了很多代码却没有客户。这是错误的操作顺序，所以我们欺骗自己，在现实中，发生了什么好事，现实是，我们是一群蟑螂，原因是，这是非常重要的，产品前市场适合储蓄尽可能多的现金，花费尽可能少，并延长你的跑道尽可能长的时间。很多创始人都犯了一个错误，他们一有想法就会花很多钱在销售、营销或其他事情上，但在现实中，直到你发现产品市场适合你，直到你找到人们想要的东西，你就不应该在这个问题上花费任何时间。你应该把时间花在和客户交谈和迭代，你真的想限制你的跑道或限制你的烧伤，这样你就可以有一个非常长的跑道。我们就是这么做的。我们的烧伤程度很低。我想我们每年向自己支付的最低允许金额是20或30k。我们住在公寓/办公室里。公司支付了一部分作为办公室的费用。

It was the minimal thing. We stretched out our runway through as  many ideas as we could. To make this process a little bit more explicit, step  one is that you build launch and iterate on several different ideas and this is  where it's really important to be a cockroach where you're conserving everything you have. Then  suddenly something magical happens. We'll talk about that and this is product market fit and  it really does feel magical. Hopefully I can illustrate to you and help you feel  that. Three, product market fit suddenly turns you into a unicorn/cockroach and rather than just  surviving after product market fit, everything gets suddenly easier. Not easy but easier. Customers show  up and buy your thing. People want to join your team. You're still pushing the  boulder up hill, if you will, but you're not totally constrained on progress. You can  actually feel forward momentum for the first time.

这是最起码的事。我们尽可能多地拓展我们的跑道。为了使这个过程更明确一点，第一步是构建、启动和迭代几个不同的想法，这是一个非常重要的地方，在这里，你保存你所有的一切，成为一只蟑螂。然后突然发生了神奇的事情。我们将讨论这一点，这是适合的产品市场，它真的感觉很神奇。希望我能向你说明并帮助你感受到这一点。第三，产品市场的契合会突然把你变成独角兽/蟑螂，而不仅仅是在产品市场适应之后生存下来，一切都会突然变得轻松起来。不容易但更容易。顾客来买你的东西。人们想加入你的团队。如果你愿意的话，你还在把巨石推上山，但你并没有完全受到进度的限制。你可以第一次感受到前进的动力。

It's not one step forward at the  product idea, full step back when a customer doesn't care. You actually can keep iterating  on a product that's starting to work. Let's take that middle portion and let's deconstruct  it a little bit. First we're going to deconstruct what we call category leaders. These  are really large companies that have been very successful. We'll get to the heart of  why product market fit is so important at the very beginning and then we'll talk  about what bad fit feels like, bad product market fit and then we'll talk about  what good product market fit feels like. We'll try to do that through stories. The  goal here is for you to walk away and be able to more easily identify  which is which with your own ideas. Category leaders. The reason we care about category  leaders is that they're much, much larger than the rest of the companies out there.  I'll give you an example. Amazon and Facebook are consumer companies that you might be  familiar with. Sales Force is a company that sells to other business that provides sales  software. The reason that we're interested in them is that they're huge. They're often 10  or a 1000 times larger than the next competitor in the space. Sales Force for  example, you have probably heard of, Sugar CRM, and Zoho are probably companies you've never  heard of. They all do roughly the same thing and so we want to dig  into how can you build a category leader. What's the layer underneath that. What it  comes down to is building a platform where it's not just a product that you're  selling but where the data inside of your product is actually useful for other business  to build their business on top of yours. That's what Sales Force has done, that's  what Amazon has done, that's what Facebook has done.

这并不是在产品理念上向前迈出一步，而是在客户不关心的情况下向后退一步。实际上，您可以继续对开始工作的产品进行迭代。让我们从中间的部分开始，把它解构一下。首先，我们要解构我们所谓的类别领导者。这些都是非常成功的大公司。我们将从一开始就深入到为什么产品市场适合如此重要的核心，然后我们将讨论什么是糟糕的产品市场，坏的产品市场适合，然后我们将讨论什么是好的产品市场适合的感觉。我们会尝试通过故事来做到这一点。这里的目标是让你离开，并能更容易地找出哪一个是与你自己的想法。类别领导。我们关心类别领导者的原因是他们比其他公司要大得多。我给你举个例子。亚马逊和Facebook是你可能熟悉的消费公司。SalesForce是一家向提供销售软件的其他企业销售产品的公司。我们之所以对它们感兴趣是因为它们很大。它们通常比空间中的下一个竞争对手大10倍或1000倍。例如，你可能听说过SugarCRM和Zoho这两个你从未听说过的公司。他们都做了大致相同的事情，所以我们想深入了解如何才能建立一个类别领导。那下面是什么层。问题的关键在于构建一个平台，在这个平台上，它不仅仅是一个你正在销售的产品，而且你产品中的数据实际上对其他企业在你的基础上建立他们的业务是有用的。这就是销售团队所做的，这就是亚马逊所做的，也是Facebook所做的。

If you look at Sales Force,  they have something called the app exchange. The app exchange reveals all the data inside  of Sales Force and allows other companies to build marketing and sales products on top  of that. Similarly, Amazon has the reseller program where now there's tons of other businesses  built on top of Amazon. The key here is having some sort of platform eventually,  when you get to scale, having some sort of platform that other companies are building  on, selling, and by nature of that, pulls people into your ecosystem but how do  you build a platform like that? I know Peter Thiel may not be the most  popular right now but his opinion is that to build a sustainable and compelling platform,  you really need to get to $100 million in revenue. The reason is just that  you need to be at a scale where someone actually can capture a couple percentage  points of your customer base and build a real business themselves.

如果你看看销售团队，他们有一个叫做应用交换的东西。应用程序交换揭示了销售团队内部的所有数据，并允许其他公司在此基础上建立营销和销售产品。同样的，亚马逊也有一个转卖计划，在那里现在有很多其他的企业建立在亚马逊之上。这里的关键是最终拥有某种平台，当你达到规模时，拥有其他公司正在建立、销售的某种平台，从本质上讲，它会把人们吸引到你的生态系统中，但你是如何构建这样一个平台的呢？我知道彼得·蒂尔现在可能不是最受欢迎的人，但他的观点是，要建立一个可持续且引人注目的平台，你真的需要获得1亿美元的收入。原因只是，你需要的规模，某人实际上可以抓住你的客户基础的几个百分点，并建立一个真正的业务本身。

If they can capture  a couple percentage points, say two to three million in revenue, that's a real business.  You can build something on top of that. You want to build a category leader.  To do that, you need a platform to do that, you need 100 million in  revenue so let's keep digging. 100 million in revenue is tough so let's keep digging  down.

如果他们能获得几个百分点的收入，比如说两百万到三百万的收入，那就是真正的生意。你可以在上面建些东西。你想要建立一个类别领袖。要做到这一点，你需要一个平台来做到这一点，你需要1亿美元的收入，所以让我们继续挖掘。1亿美元的收入很难，所以让我们继续挖掘下去吧。

I think you met Jason Lumpkin a couple weeks ago, am I right? Maybe  he's coming soon. He's written some amazing stuff about building softwares of service business. Would  highly recommend reading all his answers on Quora. He breaks down the path to 100  million in revenue in three different steps. He says zero to one million is impossible.  One to 10 million is improbable and 10 to 100 is inevitable. He says that  10 to 100 is inevitable because at that point, there's just so much momentum. You  have customers out there who are singing you praises. They're buying, their companies are going  to buy more.

我想你几周前见过杰森·兰普金，对吗？也许他很快就来了。他写了一些关于建立服务业务软件的精彩文章。强烈建议阅读他在Quora上的所有答案。他在三个不同的步骤中打破了一亿美元的收入道路。他说零到一百万是不可能的。一到一千万是不可能的，十到一百是不可避免的。他说，10到100是不可避免的，因为在那个时候，有这么多的动力。你的顾客都在赞美你。他们正在购买，他们的公司将购买更多。

It might take you a while but eventually you're going to get  from 10 to 100. One to 10 million I think is always a brutal grind  for the founders and the reason is that you're running a real business. You have  real customers, you have some scale, your customers have reasonable demands about how the quality  of service that they expect from the product but the problem is that pre 10  million in revenue, you have a really tough time attracting a world class management team.  You can't hire a great exec team yet because the large enough market isn't there.  What you have is the early crew holding the ship together and trying to make  sure that it's going to work.

这可能需要你一段时间，但最终你会得到从10到100。我认为，对于创始人来说，一千万到一千万都是残酷的磨难，原因是你在经营一家真正的企业。你有真正的客户，你有一定的规模，你的客户对产品的服务质量有合理的要求，但问题是一千万英镑的收入，你很难吸引一支世界级的管理团队。你还不能雇佣一支优秀的高管团队，因为还没有足够大的市场。你所拥有的是早期的船员们将这艘船团结在一起，并试图确保它能正常工作。

It's a very tough period I think for most  founders to scale through and then zero to one million is impossible because this is  finding product market fit and 80% or more people fail at that first step. The  question is, how can you actually make it through that impossible section and become one  of the ones that succeeds and one of the things that people talk about as  investors or founders is how important it is to learn from failure.

我认为，这是一个非常艰难的时期，对大多数创始人来说，要扩大规模是不可能的，因为这是找到合适的产品市场，80%或更多的人在第一步就失败了。问题是，你如何才能通过这一不可能的部分，成为成功的人之一，而人们作为投资者或创始人谈论的事情之一就是从失败中吸取教训是多么重要。

I recently read  a pretty good study talking about the stats of an actual analysis of failure and  success and start ups and finding product market fit. The research shows that you're actually  no more likely to succeed the second time around if you fail the first time.  If you fail in finding product market fit the first time, your odds of success  are still 20 or 22% the second time around but if you succeed in finding  product market it, the chances of your success the second time around go from 22%  to 34% which is still miserable but it's at least 50% better so what I  think that means is that there's actually not that much information encoded in finding product  market fit. You don't actually learn that much but there's quite a bit encoded in  feeling the success of understanding what did work. When we were struggling to find product  market fit in 2011 and 2012, I felt this really acutely. We had failed multiple  times at this point but I still didn't feel like I knew what I was  looking for. What is this mystical product market fit thing? It's so frustrating and we  kept seeing glimmers of hope. We kept convincing ourselves that this, that or the other  thing, a visitor chatting with us on our site was a big deal or vaguely  interested sales prospect was product market fit and so without any positive product market fit  examples, we didn't really know what it looked like so we could convince ourselves with  everything. The way I think about it now, I really, desperately, if you imagine a  machine learning model, I had a bunch of negative training set examples and I had  no positive training set examples so of course, my machine learning algorithm was like oh,  no.

最近，我读到了一篇很好的研究，讨论了对失败和成功进行实际分析的统计数据，以及启动和发现适合产品市场的数据。研究表明，如果你第一次失败的话，你就不太可能在第二次成功了。如果你第一次找不到合适的产品市场，你第二次成功的几率仍然是20%或22%，但如果你成功地找到了产品市场，那么你第二次成功的机会从22%降到34%，这仍然是痛苦的，但至少50%更好，所以我认为这意味着实际上，没有那么多信息编码在发现产品市场适合。你实际上并没有学到那么多，但是在感觉到成功的理解什么是有效的过程中有相当多的编码。当我们在2011年和2012年努力寻找合适的产品市场时，我真的感觉到了这一点。我们在这一点上失败了好几次，但我仍然觉得自己不知道自己在寻找什么。这个神秘的产品市场适合什么东西？这太令人沮丧了，我们一直看到一线希望。我们一直在说服自己，或者说，在我们的网站上和我们聊天的访问者是一件大事，或者说我们对销售前景有着模糊的兴趣，那就是产品市场的适合性，所以如果没有任何积极的产品市场适合的例子，我们就不知道它是什么样子的，所以我们可以用所有的东西来说服自己。按照我现在的想法，我真的，拼命地，如果你想象一个机器学习模型，我有一堆消极的训练集例子，我没有正数训练集的例子-当然，我的机器学习算法就像哦，不。

I'm now going to walk through three stories.

我现在要走三层楼。

I showed you two examples of  failure, actually five ish stories. Two examples of failure and then three examples on the  positive side of times we did feel product market fit and again, my goal is  for you to actually feel what this feels like so you can identify it in  your own product. Today's segment is a customer data platform but we actually started as  an education tool.

我给你们看了两个失败的例子，实际上是五个错误的故事。两个失败的例子，然后是三个积极的例子，我们确实觉得产品市场是合适的，我的目标是让你真正感受到这是什么感觉，这样你就可以在你自己的产品中识别它。今天的细分市场是一个客户数据平台，但我们实际上是作为一种教育工具开始的。

It was designed for lectures like this. This is us coding in  our mountain view apartment in the summer of 2011 and the idea was that as  a professor, standing up, talking to a class, you have no idea if anyone in  the audience actually understands what you're saying and so we were students at the time  at MIT in Rhode Island School of Design. We said what we really want to  do is give students a button to push where they can say I'm confused or  I get it, either one and the professor would see this graph overtime of how  confused the students were. Might be helpful to me right now. We built this. We  were at hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

它是为这样的讲座而设计的。这是我们2011年夏天在山景公寓里的编码，当时的想法是，作为一名教授，站起来，和一堂课交谈，你不知道观众中是否有人真正理解你在说什么，所以当时我们是罗德岛设计学院(MIT)的学生。我们说过，我们真正想做的是给学生一个按钮，让他们说我很困惑，或者我明白了，不管是哪一个人和教授都会看到这张图，显示学生们是多么的困惑。现在可能对我有帮助。我们造了这个。我们有数十万行代码。

It had commenting and nodes and  all sorts of crazy stuff and we actually came to Stanford's campus, might have even  been in this hall, convinced some professors. We would run up to them after class,  this is a picture from Berkeley. We pounced on this professor right after class. We  were testing for product market fit. We were trying to convince the professor like did  you get any feedback from your class during this class, no. Okay, well we have  a solution for you. We were hustling to try to get people to use this  tool but we were mostly ignoring any test of real product market fit there and  so professors would agree to test it out for a few lectures, out of pity  maybe for some students who were from MIT, who were trying to help. We thought  that this was product market fit but it really wasn't and I'll show you why  because if you stand in the back of the classroom and look at what people  actually had on their screens, none of them were using the product. People were using  all these different things. This is that same class at Berkeley the next week, by  the way.

它有评论，节点和各种各样的疯狂的东西，我们来到斯坦福大学的校园，甚至可能在这个大厅里，说服了一些教授。下课后我们会跑到他们跟前，这是伯克利的一张照片。我们一下课就向这位教授猛扑过去。我们在测试产品市场是否合适。我们试图说服教授，就像在这节课上你从班上得到了什么反馈一样，没有。好吧，我们有个解决办法给你。我们在努力让人们使用这个工具，但我们基本上忽略了任何真正的产品市场测试，因此教授们会同意在几个讲座中测试它，也许是出于同情，一些来自麻省理工学院的学生试图帮助他们。我们认为这是适合产品市场的，但事实并非如此。我会告诉你为什么，因为如果你站在教室的后面，看看人们在屏幕上的实际情况，他们中没有人在使用这种产品。人们在使用这些不同的东西。顺便说一句，这是伯克利的同一堂课。

It was horrifying. As soon as the students opened their laptops, they all  went and did other things. Putting a laptop into the classroom was the most distracting  thing you could conceivably do. As you can imagine, this was pretty horrifying. One of  the more embarrassing things that could have happened to us, we had just raised 600k  coming out of and we had sold this vision of this is how the future  of classrooms is going to work.

太恐怖了。学生们一打开笔记本电脑，就都去做其他事情。把笔记本电脑放进教室是最让人分心的事情。正如你所能想象的，这是相当可怕的。可能会发生在我们身上的更尴尬的事情之一，我们刚刚筹集了60万美元，我们卖了这个愿景-教室的未来是如何运作的。

It's going to be digital.

它将是数字化的。

It's going to be  online, much as this is a , et cetera.

它将在网上，就像这是一个，以此类推。

It was a great vision but  again, the market wins every time.

这是一个伟大的愿景，但再次，市场赢了每一次。

It doesn't matter what your vision is.

不管你的愿景是什么。

It matters  what the market actually wants.

市场真正想要的是什么？

In this case, the students didn't care. The students didn't  get that much value out of using the tool.

在这种情况下，学生们根本不在乎。学生们没有从使用这个工具中获得太多的价值。

If you go back, we should've  hadn't even earlier warning sign which is that the professors didn't really want to use  the tool either. You go and talk to the professors. They would sort of out  of pity agree to test it for a few lectures but that is not the  same thing as product market fit where they're like holy crap, that solves this problem  that I have.

如果你回去的话，我们就不应该更早地发出警告信号，那就是教授们也不想使用这个工具。你去和教授谈谈。他们会出于怜悯同意测试几个讲座，但这与产品市场适合他们就像神圣的垃圾，解决了这个问题，我的问题，这是不一样的事情。

It's sort of bullying customers into using your product is not anything  close to product market fit even if they reticently agree to do it.

这是在恐吓顾客使用你的产品并不适合产品市场，即使他们沉默地同意这样做。

I think  being dismissive of users and having your clear vision of the future isn't necessarily solving  a problem for your customers.

我认为，对用户不屑一顾，对未来有清晰的看法并不一定能解决客户的问题。

It's a pretty stunning failure on our part and it's  a key thing that founder do again, and again, and again and their search for  product market fit. Then we had to do the awkward thing which by the way  is the right thing of calling back all the investors and saying ... This was  four weeks after they'd sign the checks, by the way, turns out this is a  terrible idea. We're going to do something. Do you want your money back? In most  of these cases, the investors did not take their money back. They said we invested  for the team like go find another idea. We believe in you guys. Go find  something else. We said okay, let's do it. We were all committed, very committed to  working together as a team of four founders. We shut down the lecture tool. We  went and shut it down in all the classrooms. We went back to the whiteboard  and we said what is something that is interesting here and we had always felt  that we should have been able to determine that we didn't have product market fit  that the product usage wasn't there from our actual data. The way we figured this  out was we went and stood in the classroom, back where Sam is and looked  at what was on all the laptop screens and that was how we figured out  if we had product market fit or not. We should have been able to do  that with the data. We should have been able to look at the analytics and  figure out not only are people using it or not but our anthropology class is  using it different than computer science classes. We decided to build an analytics tool which  it turns out is a bad idea in case anyone is considering that. The way  that we approached this is, how many of you have read the book Lean Start  Up? Wow, that's actually awesome. Y'all are way far ahead. As Lean Start Up talking  about, you want to get out of the building and actually talk to customers. We  read that right around this moment and we were like we're going to go out  and talk to customers. We did that and we tried to validate our ideas so  we'd take people out for coffee and we'd pull people from companies and try to  figure out if they were interested in analytics products.

这是一个相当惊人的失败对我们来说，这是一个关键的事情，创始人一次又一次，并寻找他们的产品市场适合。然后我们不得不做一件尴尬的事，顺便说一句，打电话给所有的投资者说.在他们签支票四个星期后，顺便说一句，这是个糟糕的主意。我们要做点什么。你想要回你的钱吗？在大多数情况下，投资者没有收回他们的钱。他们说我们为团队投资就像去找另一个点子。我们相信你们。去找点别的东西。我们说好的，我们开始吧。我们都致力于，非常致力于作为一个由四位创始人组成的团队一起工作。我们关闭了讲座工具。我们在所有的教室里都关闭了它。我们回到白板上，我们说了一些有趣的东西，我们一直觉得我们应该能够确定我们的产品市场不适合，因为我们的实际数据中没有产品的使用情况。我们的思路是，我们去教室，站在教室里，回到萨姆的位置，看看所有笔记本电脑屏幕上的东西，这就是我们如何判断我们是否适合产品市场。我们应该能够用数据做到这一点。我们应该能够看到分析，并找出不仅是人们使用它或不使用，而且我们的人类学课使用它不同于计算机科学课程。我们决定建立一个分析工具，这是一个坏主意，以防任何人考虑。我们处理这个问题的方式是，你们中有多少人读过“精益创业”一书？哇，真是太棒了。你们都遥遥领先。当精益开始谈论的时候，你想离开大楼，和顾客交谈。就在这一刻，我们读到了这篇文章，就像我们要出去和顾客交谈一样。我们这样做了，我们试图验证我们的想法，所以我们会带人们出去喝咖啡，我们会把公司的人从公司里拉出来，试图找出他们是否对分析产品感兴趣。

I'd say again and again, they  were vaguely interested and they had willingness to meet and chat with us and they  said they wanted product updates as things came out. We thought this must be it,  this must be product market fit where people are interested in what we're doing. Again,  this is not product market fit. This is idle interest. Very, very big difference. Based  on this idle interest, we got very excited and we spent the next six months  just writing codes. This is in a new office. That's my co-founder, Calvin and Ilya.  As you can see, there's lots of code on our screen. Again, wrong order of  operations.

我会一遍又一遍地说，他们很感兴趣，他们愿意和我们见面和聊天，他们说他们想在事情发生后更新产品。我们认为这是必须的，这必须是产品市场适合的地方，人们对我们正在做的事情感兴趣。再说一次，这并不适合产品市场。这是无中生有的利益。非常大的差别。基于这种无中生有的兴趣，我们非常兴奋，在接下来的六个月里，我们只是在写代码。这是在新办公室里。那是我的联合创始人卡尔文和伊利亚。如您所见，我们的屏幕上有很多代码。再一次错误的操作顺序。

I had gone on one sales trip to visit potential customers and they were  all pretty happy with mixed panel and Google analytics but they had these edge case  features that they were hoping that we could solve and so I tricked myself into  believing that these little edge cases that we might be able to solve were actually  really a wide gap that we could fill as a product.

我去过一次销售之旅，拜访潜在的客户，他们对混合面板和谷歌分析都很满意，但他们有这些边缘案例的功能，他们希望我们能解决，所以我骗自己相信，我们可能解决的这些小边缘案例实际上是一个很大的差距，我们可以填补作为一个产品。

I came back and  I pitched to my co-founders and we would keep believing that we were almost there  if we just ship one more feature, one more thing, we're going to get to  product market fit. Again, bad idea. We used lots of little positive interactions like this.  You can also read this not as a positive interaction but every once in a  while, some stray person would visit our website and they'd open a chat. This is  idle interest. Hey, what's Segment? This is a complete transcript of that website chat. You  can see it's 3 AM so we're up late coding. This person is interested so  maybe this is product market fit. Again, this is not what it looks like. This  is just idle interest.

我回来后，我向我的联合创始人推销，我们会一直相信，如果我们再推出一个功能，再做一件事，我们就能得到产品市场的契合。再说一次，坏主意。我们使用了很多小的积极的互动，像这样。你也可以读到这不是一个积极的互动，但偶尔，一些流浪的人会访问我们的网站，他们会打开聊天。这是无中生有的利益。嘿，什么是段？这是该网站聊天的完整记录。你看现在是凌晨3点，所以我们晚了编码。这个人很感兴趣，所以也许这是适合产品市场的。再说一次，这不是看上去的样子。这只是无中生有的利益。

It's not December 2012. We've been at this for about a  year and a half and we decided that something was wrong. Clearly this was not  working. We went back to YC. We emailed Paul Graham and we said hey, we  think we should catch up and explain what's happened over the last year and a  half. Okay great. So we go, this is us in front of the old YC  building. We're walking around the little cul-de-sac by YC on Pioneer Way. We're bringing him  up to speed. We spent half a million dollars. Here's everything we've been through over  the last couple of years and as we're walking around, he comes to a stop  and he looks at us and he says so just to be clear, you've spent  half a million dollars and you have nothing to show for it. Totally accurate and  super fair and shocked us into oh, shit, we got to do something. That was  the moment where we realized we had hit rock bottom but we still had 100k  left so we still got one more shot. That was all the product market fit  failure cases. Now you're going to see some success but let's rewind. Let's go all  the way back to the first week of YC.

现在不是2012年12月。我们已经干了一年半了，我们决定出了点问题。很明显这不管用。我们回到了YC。我们给保罗·格雷厄姆发了电子邮件，我们说，嘿，我们认为我们应该跟上并解释过去一年半发生的事情。好吧太好了。所以我们走，这是我们在老YC大楼前面。我们在先锋路上绕着YC的小包走。我们要让他跟上速度。我们花了50万美元。这是我们在过去几年里所经历的一切，当我们四处走动时，他停了下来，他看着我们，他说，为了澄清，你已经花了50万美元，你没有什么可展示的。完全准确，非常公平，震惊了我们-哦，妈的，我们得做点什么。就在那一刻，我们意识到我们已经触底了，但我们还有100公里，所以我们还有一次机会。这就是所有的产品市场适合失败的案例。现在你将看到一些成功，但让我们倒带。让我们回到YC的第一周。

In that first week, we had  been like well, we have this classroom lecture tool and we should have analytics on  it so we looked at the different analytics tools, case metrics, Google analytics, mixed panel  and we were looking at what's similar here and we saw they have different graphs  and different APIs but it's actually the same data going into all these tools. They  give you different stuff out the other end. We don't really want to make a  business decision here about which tool we want to use so we'll just solve the  engineering problem because we're engineers. We'll just build some code that sends data to all  three and does this automatic translation so we put one data point in, it gets  translated into three API calls that go out to all three services. Cool, this was  100 lines of code and the hundreds of thousands that we wrote. Set that aside.  Then about four months later, it gets improved a little bit, four months later, it  gets improved a little bit, at that point, we are trying to sell our own  analytics tool akin to mixed panel and Google analytics. We keep encountering the sales objection  when we're trying to sell it which is I already have mixed panel installed.

在第一周，我们有了这个课堂演讲工具，我们应该对它进行分析，所以我们研究了不同的分析工具，案例度量，谷歌分析，混合面板，我们在这里看到了相似的东西，我们看到它们有不同的图表和不同的API，但是实际上，这些工具中的数据是相同的。他们从另一端给你不同的东西。我们并不是真的想在这里对我们想要使用的工具做出商业决定，所以我们只需要解决工程问题，因为我们是工程师。我们将构建一些代码，将数据发送到所有三个服务，并进行自动转换，因此我们在其中放置一个数据点，将其转换为三个API调用，这些API调用都指向所有三个服务。酷，这是我们写的100行代码和几十万行代码。把这个放在一边。大约四个月后，它得到了一点改进，四个月后，它得到了一些改进，在那个时候，我们试图销售我们自己的分析工具，类似于混合面板和谷歌分析。我们一直遇到销售反对，当我们试图出售它，即我已经安装了混合面板。

I  don't really want to install your tool.

我真的不想安装你的工具。

It seems like a lot of work so  my co-founder Ilya has this great idea. He says what if we take that little  library road a year ago that we've totally forgotten about and we add ourselves as  the fourth service that it can send data too and then every time somebody hits  us with that objection, we hit them with the open source library and we say  okay, great now you can try them both in parallel and we use it as  like a growth hack to get customers to start adopting our tool. Okay great. We  started doing that. We start sending it out, people start replying. This is awesome.

这似乎是很多工作，所以我的联合创始人伊利亚有一个伟大的想法。他说，如果我们一年前走了一条我们完全忘记的小图书馆之路，我们把自己作为第四种服务，它也可以发送数据，然后每次有人反对我们，我们就用开源库来攻击它们，我们说，好吧，很好，现在你可以并行地尝试它们，然后我们使用这就像一个增长黑客，让客户开始采用我们的工具。好吧太好了。我们开始这么做。我们开始发送，人们开始回复。这太棒了。

I  love the library.

我喜欢图书馆。

I'm definitely going to use it. Few weeks later, we follow up.  Hey, we saw that you're still not sending any data to Segment.io, what's going on.  They're like well the library is fantastic.

我肯定会用它。几周后，我们跟进。嘿，我们看到你还没把任何数据发送给段。噢，怎么回事。他们很好，图书馆太棒了。

I just don't really want to use your  analytics service. Should have taken note right then but few months go by, people start  starring us on GetHub.

我只是不想使用你的分析服务。当时应该注意到，但几个月过去了，人们开始在GetHub上主演我们。

It was a big deal for us at the time, 30  stars.

当时这对我们来说是件大事，30位明星。

I think maybe there was one poor request issued and then fast forward some  more, people keep paying attention.

我想也许有一个错误的请求发出，然后快速前进，更多，人们一直在关注。

It's the first time we ever felt pull. People were  finding this thing and doing something with it and fast forward, we have this conversation  with PG. The next day, we sit down and we're like all right. We need  a new idea. My co-founder Ian is like you know what? I have an idea.  Remember that analytics library that has been idling on GetHub, I think that could be  a big business.

这是我们第一次感觉到拉力。人们发现了这件事，用它做了一些事情，然后快速前进，我们和PG进行了对话。第二天，我们坐下来，感觉很好。我们需要一个新的想法。我的联合创始人伊恩就像你知道吗？我有个主意请记住，一直闲置在GetHub上的分析图书馆，我认为这可能是一笔大生意。

I was like you've got to be kidding me. That's the worst  idea I've ever heard. First of all it's open source. Second of all, it's 580  lines of codes. Who the heck is going to pay for that? How do you  build a business around that? It makes no sense. We're fighting and fighting and fighting  and I went home and I was wracking my brain like how can I kill  this idea? It's really bad.

我就像你在开玩笑。这是我听过的最糟糕的主意了。首先，它是开源的。其次，是580行代码。谁会为此付出代价？你如何以此为基础建立一家企业？这毫无意义。我们在战斗，我回到家，我绞尽脑汁，想怎样才能扼杀这个想法？真的很糟糕。

It's going to sink us. We only have one more  shot.

它会让我们沉下去的。我们只有一次机会。

I came in the next day and I was like here's what we're going  to do. We're going to build a landing page.

我第二天就来了，就像我们要做的一样。我们要建立一个登陆页面。

It's going to be an awesome  landing page.

这将是一个令人敬畏的登陆页面。

It's going to be beautiful. We're going to put up it on Hackernews.  It's going to pitch the product and I'll have an email sign up form at  the bottom and we'll use this to test whether it's a good idea or not.  They agree like okay, great. Totally done. We get ready to launch it on Hackernews.  I'm starting to think about other ideas and it goes straight to the top.

一定会很漂亮的。我们要把它放到黑客新闻上。它将介绍该产品，我将有一个电子邮件注册表格在底部，我们将使用这个来测试它是否一个好主意。他们同意得很好。完事了。我们准备在黑客新闻上发布。我开始考虑其他的想法，它直接到了顶端。

It  gets about 300 up votes on Hackernews.

它在HackerNews上获得了大约300张选票。

It gets a few thousand stars of GetHub.  We have people reaching out to us on LinkedIn demanding access to the beta. This  guy says what does a brother have to do to get bumped up on your  beta list? There were others like this. Holy crap. Full stop. Compare this to everything  previously. Everything changed. This is what product market fit looks like where it's not just  a single metric slowly starts moving, it's not just a few random conversations where people  express vague interest. Every single metric went totally haywire. With our lecture tool and our  analytics tool, we've been searching in the dark for what features to build next. We  did not have that problem anymore. There were thousands of people who had signed up  and they're like you're seven integrations are good but I need these 10 more and  I'm deploying it tomorrow on blah blah, holy crap, slow down. That's actually one of  the key things. One of the key things is that it flips from being something  that you're pushing against the customer to all of a sudden, the customer's running away  with it like hold on, wait, it's not quite ready yet. Another example with our  analytics tool, we had this sad unanswered questions and chats. No one really seemed to  care about what we had built but now we had thousands of stars, people wishing  poll requests, we got 10 poll requests in the first 48 hours or something like  that.

它得到了几千颗格赫布星。我们有很多人在LinkedIn上向我们伸出援手，要求访问测试版。这家伙说一个兄弟要怎么做才能被列入你的测试版名单？还有其他类似的。我的天啊。完全停止。将此与以前的一切进行比较。一切都变了。这就是产品市场的状况，它不仅仅是一个单一的指标开始缓慢移动，它不仅仅是一些随机的谈话，人们表达了模糊的兴趣。每一个指标都完全失控了。使用我们的演讲工具和分析工具，我们一直在黑暗中寻找下一步需要构建哪些功能。我们不再有这个问题了。有成千上万的人已经注册了，他们就像你一样，七个集成是好的，但我需要这10个更多，我将部署它的废话，天哪，慢慢来。这实际上是关键之一。其中一件关键的事情是，它从你在推给顾客的东西变成了突然之间，客户就像抓住它一样跑掉了，等等，它还没有完全准备好。另一个例子，我们的分析工具，我们有这个可悲的未回答的问题和聊天。似乎没有人真正关心我们建造了什么，但是现在我们有成千上万的明星，人们希望投票请求，我们在最初的48小时内收到了10个投票请求，或者类似的事情。

I guess the other key thing is with our lecture tool and with our  analytics tool. We had this huge vision, we had this vision of here's how the  classroom should operate. Here's how companies should do analytics. We went about trying to build  a product that fit the vision but this was the total opposite. This was a  little tiny library that we built for ourselves that solved a real problem, had no  vision associated with it whatsoever at the beginning. Now it does because we have something  that we want to go accomplish but at the beginning it solves the tiniest of  tiny problems and it's your question earlier, this is that tiny little foothold and again,  it's an open source library with 580 lines of code. That's a foothold and since  then, we've expanded greatly into doing all sorts of things and solving adjacent problems for  customers. The market doesn't care at all what your vision of the world is. The  market wants what it wants and it will win every time.

我想另一个关键是我们的演讲工具和我们的分析工具。我们有一个巨大的愿景，我们有这样的愿景：教室应该如何运作。以下是公司应该如何进行分析。我们试着开发出一款符合我们愿景的产品，但事实恰恰相反。这是一个我们为自己建造的小型图书馆，解决了一个真正的问题，从一开始就没有任何与之相关的愿景。这是因为我们想要完成一些事情，但在开始的时候，它解决了最小的一些小问题，这是你之前的问题，这是一个小小的立足点，它是一个开源库，包含580行代码。这是一个立足点，从那时起，我们已经扩展到做各种各样的事情，为客户解决相邻的问题。市场根本不在乎你对世界的看法。市场想要它想要的，它每次都会赢。

If you walk away  with one thing today, I think let's be incredible that basically product market fit doesn't  feel like vague idle interest.

如果你今天放弃了一件事，我想让我们难以置信的是，基本上，产品市场适合的感觉不像是模糊的闲散兴趣。

It doesn't feel like a glimmer of hope from some  earlier conversation.

从早些时候的谈话中可以看出，这并不是一丝希望。

It doesn't feel like a trickle of people signing up.

这感觉不像是一小群人注册了。

It really feels  like everything in your business has gone totally haywire. There's a big rush of adrenaline  from customers starting to adopt it and ripping it out of your hands.

我真的觉得你生意上的一切都搞砸了。有一大群来自客户的肾上腺素开始采用，并从你的手中撕下它。

It feels  like the market is dragging you forward.

感觉就像市场在拖你的后腿。

I think the dropbox founders said this best  that product market fit feels like stepping on a landmine. You can't mistake the two  so if you are at all questioning if you have product market fit or not,  you don't. Obviously that didn't stop us from making this mistake so just to make  sure that ... Wait this is backwards, oh no, it's not.

我认为Dropbox的创始人们说得最好，产品市场适合的感觉就像踩上了地雷。你不能搞错这两件事，所以如果你在质疑你是否适合产品市场，你就不会。很明显，这并没有阻止我们犯这个错误，只是为了确保.等等，这是倒过来的，哦，不是。

I thought class metric  for sure had product market fit. Big vision. Market said no. Market doesn't care what  you think.

我认为等级指标确实适合产品市场。大视野。市场说不行。市场不在乎你怎么想。

I thought Segment io for sure had great market fit. Again, market said  no. Market doesn't care. Market wins. Even on our third attempt when we did find  product market fit, I thought for sure, this is too tiny to matter but it  actually solved a real problem and the market demanded it and ripped it out of  our hands. Either that goes to show how obtuse I am or how hard it  is to find product market fit.

我认为塞格门蒂奥肯定有很好的市场适合。市场又一次拒绝了。市场不在乎。市场赢了。即使在我们第三次尝试找到合适的产品市场时，我也肯定地认为，这件事太小了，但它实际上解决了一个真正的问题，市场要求它，并把它从我们的手中夺走。这要么表明我是多么愚蠢，要么就是很难找到适合自己的产品市场。

Speaker 4: How come people lack the taste for something that was open source
Peter : Good question.

演讲者4：为什么人们对开源的东西缺乏兴趣，彼得：好问题。

It turns out that the open source library-  Oh, sorry. The question is why would someone pay anything for an open source library  that's 580 lines of code. Good question.

原来开源库-哦，对不起。问题是，为什么有人会为一个包含580行代码的开源库支付任何费用。问得好。

It turns out that the open source library  by itself doesn't totally solve the problem so the actual problem that we found out  that we were solving after we launched it was that marketing teams keep coming to  engineering departments and saying I just signed a contract with exact target, an email marketing  tool or I just signed a contract with W analytics. Here's the docs. The engineering  team says what the heck, I have a roadmap.

事实证明，开放源码库本身并不能完全解决问题，所以我们发现的实际问题是，在我们启动后，市场营销团队不断来到工程部，说我刚刚签署了一份目标明确的合同，一个电子邮件营销工具，或者我刚刚和W分析公司签了一份合同。这是医生。工程小组说了什么，我有一个路线图。

I need to be executing on  this other thing.

我需要在另一件事上执行死刑。

I can't do this analytics implementation and what really needed to happen  and what analytics js could solve the problem that we could solve is the hosted  version is allowing engineers to do a single implementation of collecting that data once and  then letting marketers just push buttons in our interface to send the data wherever they  need it but the open source library doesn't solve that problem. Engineers saw that it  was the right abstraction but if a marketer needed a new tool and there was  no preserved version, the engineer still has to go compile it.

我无法完成这个分析实现，真正需要实现的是分析js能够解决的问题，我们可以解决的问题是，托管版本允许工程师完成一次收集数据的单个实现，然后让营销人员在我们的界面上按下按钮，将数据发送到他们需要的地方，但是开源库并不能解决这个问题。工程师们认为这是正确的抽象，但是如果营销人员需要一个新的工具，并且没有保存的版本，工程师仍然需要编译它。

In some ways, we  got lucky that the open sourced version doesn't fully solve the problem.

在某些方面，我们幸运的是开源版本没有完全解决问题。

I'm going to  steal gratuitously from Allan Kay's slides again.

我又要从艾伦·凯的幻灯片上偷东西了。

I think finding product market fit feels a  lot like finding this blue plane when you're in the pink plane.

我认为找到适合产品市场的感觉很像在粉红色飞机上找到这架蓝色飞机。

I want to  give some other examples of finding product market fit after finding that initial product market  fit. They key difference from that initial break through from what Allan Kay was talking  about was that rather than removing yourself from the world and trying to imagine what  the future is like, you actually need to go out into the world and research  what problems people really have. Once you find that product, once you find that blue  plane, then things actually get enormously easier. That blue plane is a foothold into a  totally new perspective and I think Allan Kay talked about the value of perspective on  context should it get this foothold into a new way of thinking about the world,  a new way of solving some problem for someone and so not only do you  know what good fit feels like but you now are operating in green pastures and  you're approaching problems in ways that all the incumbents in the pink plane don't think  about the world.

在发现最初的产品市场适合之后，我想给出一些其他的寻找产品市场适合的例子。与艾伦·凯所说的最初突破不同的是，与之不同的是，与其把自己从这个世界中移开，去想象未来是什么样子，你实际上需要走出这个世界，去研究人们到底有什么问题。一旦你找到了那个产品，一旦你找到了那个蓝色的飞机，事情就会变得非常容易。那个蓝色的平面是一个全新视角的立足点，我认为艾伦·凯谈到了视角在语境中的价值，如果它能让这个视角进入一个新的思考世界的方式，一种解决问题的新方法，那么你不仅知道合适的感觉是什么，而且你现在是在绿色的环境中运作。牧场和你在处理问题的方式，在粉红色飞机上的所有现任者都不考虑世界。

I wanted to give you two examples of finding product market fit  since that initial win for us. Short intro to what Segment does, we help people  collect data from mobile apps and websites. We pull it up to Segment and we  fan it out to all the different tools that you need. That's all you really  need to know. One of the places where we could send data was Amazon S3.  This is a place to put all your log files. We started to notice that  all our business tier customers were using this one integration. They were all sending their  data to S3 but you have to do something with the data. You don't just  collect log files. You do something with log files. We were like what the heck  is going on here so we went and visited five of our largest customers in  New York, this was about three years ago and we said okay, you're using the  S3 integration but what the heck are you using it for? For five out of  five customers in a row, they said well we have a data engineering team that's  taking data from the S3 bucket, converting it into CS view files and managing all  the schema-translations and now they're uploading it into a data warehouse like Redshift. The first  time I heard that from a customer, I was like okay, that's interesting.

我想给你两个例子，找到适合的产品市场，因为我们最初的胜利。简短的介绍段做什么，我们帮助人们收集移动应用程序和网站的数据。我们把它拉到片段上，然后把它扇出到您需要的所有不同的工具中。这就是你真正需要知道的。我们可以发送数据的地方之一是AmazonS 3。这是一个存放所有日志文件的地方。我们开始注意到，我们所有的业务层客户都在使用这一集成。他们都把他们的数据发送到S3，但你必须对数据做些什么。你不只是收集日志文件。你用日志文件做些什么。我们就像这里发生的事情，所以我们去拜访了我们在纽约的五个最大的客户，这是三年前，我们说，好吧，你在使用S3集成，但是你用它做什么呢？对于五分之五的客户来说，他们说，我们有一个数据工程团队，从S3桶中获取数据，将其转换成CS视图文件，并管理所有模式转换，现在他们将其上传到像RedShift这样的数据仓库中。当我第一次听到顾客这么说的时候，我觉得很好，这很有趣。

I took  a note, went to the second meeting, customer said the exactly same thing.

我做了个笔记，去参加第二次会议，顾客说了完全一样的话。

I said  that's weird. Taking note. Third conversation, I was like this is getting ridiculous. Did you  guys talk ahead of time or what happened here? By the fifth time, obviously I  know what we need to build. We just need to build a connection from this,  straight to Redshift. Then the question we went and built that and just to show  you now, now we have a company that here in millions of dollars in revenue.  We have a real product that real people are using. What does product market fit  look like at that point? We're introducing a second product basically.

我说这很奇怪。注意到。第三次谈话，我觉得这太荒谬了。你们提前说话了还是这里发生了什么？到了第五次，显然我知道我们需要建造什么了。我们只需要从这里建立一个连接，直接到RedShift。然后，我们提出了一个问题，这个问题就是为了向大家展示，现在我们有了一家公司，公司的收入达到了数百万美元。我们有一个真正的产品，真正的人正在使用。在那个时候，产品市场是什么样的呢？我们基本上是在推出第二种产品。

It looks like this.  You can tell when we introduced Redshift. Again, almost every metric in the business goes  nuts so it's very, very clear whether or not you have something that is really  transformative for your customers or not. One more story and then I will open it  up for Q and A. This is maybe about five months ago, we had five  ideas for products that we thought might be exciting to our customers so I went  to visit a customer up large company, up in the Pacific Northwest.

看起来像这样。你知道我们什么时候引进红移的。再说一遍，几乎所有的衡量标准都是疯狂的，所以很清楚你是否有什么能真正为你的客户带来变革的东西。再讲一个故事，然后我将为Q和A打开它。这大概是五个月前，我们有五个产品的想法，我们认为这些产品可能会让我们的客户兴奋，所以我去拜访了一家大公司，位于太平洋西北部的一家大公司。

I sat down  with a data architect there and I said okay, here are the five ideas that  I want to run through and see if they're interesting to you.

我和一位数据架构师坐了下来，我说，好吧，这是我想要讨论的五个想法，看看它们是否对你感兴趣。

I went through  the first idea and he was like yeah, you know what? I totally get it.  That sounds super valuable.

我经历了第一个想法，他说是的，你知道吗？我完全明白。听起来很有价值。

I went through the second one and he's like that's really  cool. That's cool that you can do that. That makes a lot of sense. Third  idea, fourth idea, same kind of thing. This is how I would summarize that. That's  great.

我经历了第二次，他觉得这很酷。你能做到真是太好了。这很有道理。第三个想法，第四个想法，同样的东西。这就是我要总结的。太棒了。

I totally understand where the value is means yeah ... That would be great.  Doesn't care is what that is code for. That's someone being nice. On the fifth  idea, I said hey, here's what we can do, blah blah blah, and he said  wait, sorry, you can do what? I re-explained it and he said oh, interesting and  he said can you set up a follow up meeting with this team, this team,  and this team? We also need to tell Joe about this because it could affect  this other thing and that again, that is the feeling of product market fit. You're  like wait, wait, no, no, it doesn't exist yet. These are ideas. All of a  sudden the customer is just going to rip it out of you and so now  you're on a tight timeline because the customer expects that it already exists. Again, that's  what product market fit actually feels like.

我完全明白价值在哪里意味着是的.。那太好了不在乎那是什么代码。那是个好人。关于第五个想法，我说嘿，这是我们能做的，诸如此类的，他说，等等，对不起，你能做什么？我重新解释了，他说，哦，有趣，他说，你能安排一个后续会议与这个团队，这个团队？我们也需要告诉乔这件事，因为它可能会影响到另一件事，那就是产品市场的契合感。你就像在等待，不，它还不存在。这些都是想法。突然之间，客户就会把它从你身上拿出来，所以现在你的时间表很紧，因为客户希望它已经存在了。同样，这也是产品市场真正适合的感觉。

I think if you want to find product  market fit and build one of these category leading companies, become one out of the  five founders that actually does succeed in finding this, I think you just need to  be really honest with yourself that the glimmers of false hope that you have is  not the same as customers ripping something out of your hands. You just need to  be honest with yourself. That's the message. Questions? Yeah, Sam?
Sam: I certainly agree, it's been my experience that product market fit is like but when  you're trying to find it, for what kind of ideas to try when you're just  casting around, looking for ideas?
Peter : I actually think that the bigger problem is not necessarily having the ideas.

我认为，如果你想找到合适的产品市场，并建立一个这样的领先公司，成为五个真正成功的创始人之一，我认为你只需要诚实地对自己说，你所拥有的虚假希望的微光与客户从你手中夺走的东西不一样。你只需要对自己诚实。这就是信息。问题？是吗萨姆？山姆：我当然同意，我的经验是，产品市场适合，但是当你试图找到它时，当你只是四处寻找想法的时候，你会尝试什么样的想法呢？彼得：我实际上认为更大的问题不一定是有想法。

I think  everyone has lots of interesting ideas.

我想每个人都有很多有趣的想法。

I think the bigger problem is not killing the  bad ideas fast enough.

我认为更大的问题是没有足够快地扼杀坏想法。

I have the most respect for the Codecademy founders in this  respect.

在这方面，我最尊敬的是科斯多米的创始人。

I think they tried 12 ideas in seven weeks or something like that, in  the summer of YC.

我认为在YC的夏天，他们在七周内尝试了12个想法，或者诸如此类的想法。

It was something totally absurd but they tried them and killed  them so fast and then four days before demo day, they started a new idea  which was Codecademy and then it worked. On launch day, on demo day, they had  300,000 users or something like that. That's the landmine effect of nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,  nothing, nothing and they were so good about killing the ideas. They had no problem  throwing out something that wasn't going to work.

这是完全荒谬的事情，但他们尝试了他们并杀死了他们这么快，然后在演示的前一天，他们开始了一个新的想法，这是科德勒米，然后它成功了。在发布日，在演示日，他们有30万用户或诸如此类的东西。这就是什么都没有的地雷效应，没什么，而且他们对扼杀这些想法很在行。他们没有问题抛出一些没用的东西。

I don't think there's any magic to  finding the right idea.

我不认为找到正确的想法有什么魔力。

If you just kill the bad ideas fast enough, you'll probably  find something.

如果你足够快地消灭坏想法，你可能会发现一些东西。

Speaker 8: Talk a little bit about pricing.

演讲者8：谈谈定价。

It seems like with 500 lines of code and  solving a significant but small problem, I don't know if that's the way to describe  it. How do you go about pricing something like that when you're doing that customer  discovery?
Peter : The question is how do you go about pricing something like this where it's 500  lines of code, it seems like it solves a small problem for people? We thought  it was a small problem for people and we underpriced hugely for a long time.  It turns out that that problem that the 500 lines of code solves, is actually  really valuable. We have lots of customers that pay over $100,000 a year to solve  that problem. There's more to the product now than the 500 lines of code, a  lot more but it's nevertheless is ... The size is the business problem.

似乎有500行代码和解决一个重要但小的问题，我不知道这是否是描述它的方式。当你在做客户发现的时候，你是如何定价的呢？彼得：问题是，你如何定价像这样的东西，当它有500行代码时，它似乎解决了人们的一个小问题？我们认为这对人们来说是个小问题，我们长期以来一直低估了价格。这500行代码解决了这个问题，实际上是很有价值的。我们有很多客户每年支付超过10万美元来解决这个问题。现在的产品有比500行代码更多的东西，更多，但它仍然是。规模是生意上的问题。

It's almost  nothing to do with the amount of code written.

这几乎与编写的代码数量无关。

I think it did take us  a little while to revalue things in that respect. To answer your question most directly,  we spent the first year just accumulating customers. We just had a lot of people  adopting it. Got to maybe 1000 or 2000 companies sending data through Segment and then  we tried experimenting with pricing and then I'd say the biggest kick in the but  to get to the right point here is we had a sales advisor who said  ... There were reasonably sized companies using us like LiveNation and Ardio and stuff like  that. We would go to sales meetings at these companies and the sales advisor would  get me pumped up ahead of time. He'd be like Peter, you have to ask  for $120,000 a year.

我认为在这方面，我们确实需要一段时间才能重新评估事情的价值。为了最直接地回答你的问题，我们只花了第一年的时间积累客户。我们刚刚有很多人收养了它。大概有1000到2000家公司通过Segment发送数据，然后我们尝试了定价，然后我想说的是，最大的好处在于我们有一位销售顾问，他说。有一些规模相当大的公司在利用我们，比如LiveNation和Ardio之类的公司。我们会去这些公司参加销售会议，销售顾问会让我提前振作起来。他会像彼得一样，你必须要求每年12万美元。

I'm like that's crazy. What are you talking about? He's like  Peter, if you don't ask for $120,000 a year, I'm quitting as your sales advisor.  I was like well, all right. Here we go.

我觉得这太疯狂了。你说什么呢?他就像彼得，如果你不要求每年12万美元，我就辞去你的销售顾问。我很好，好吧。开始吧。

I would ask, I'd turn beet  red and they would negotiate it down to 18k.

我会问，我会把甜菜变成红色，他们会把它降低到18K。

If you keep doing it, eventually  someone is like well that seems reasonable. You have to keep testing the value like  that. You don't know how much value you're delivering until you start asking for money.  I think if I had to do it over again, I'd start asking for money  earlier and I'd be a lot more comfortable with it like if you're solving a  real business problem, people are going to be happy to pay for it.

如果你一直这样做，最终有人会觉得很好，这似乎是合理的。你必须一直这样测试这个值。在你开始索要钱之前，你不知道你带来了多少价值。我想，如果我不得不再做一次，我会更早地开始要求钱，我会对它感到舒服得多，如果你要解决一个真正的商业问题，人们会很乐意为此付出代价。

I'm not  sure if I totally answered your question.

我不确定我是否完全回答了你的问题。

Speaker 9: How do you know that you're asking the right people about said product? What if  just a small shift and who you should be asking that you're not realizing how  did you-
Peter : The question is how do you know whether you're asking the right people and how  do you know whether you should slightly shift who you're talking to versus shift the  product? This is why it's so hard to find product market fit the first time  and why it's so much easier the second time once you have some product market  fit because once you do have a defined customer set that you sell to, you  can pretty easily figure out by going back to the same people whether or not  you're solving an adjacent problem for them.

演讲者9：你怎么知道你问的是正确的人说的产品？如果只是一个小小的转变，你应该问谁，你没有意识到你是怎么做到的呢-彼得：问题是，你如何知道你问的是正确的人，你如何知道你是否应该稍微改变你正在谈论的人，而不是改变你的产品？这就是为什么你很难第一次找到合适的产品市场，第二次那么容易，因为一旦你有了一个明确的客户集，你就可以很容易地找到相同的人，不管你是否在为他们解决一个相邻的问题。

It's really hard. The thing that makes it  super hard at the beginning is that it's like you have two things and you  can either slide the product or you can slide the market by talking to different  people.

真的很难。一开始让它变得非常困难的是，你有两样东西，你要么可以滑动产品，要么可以通过与不同的人交谈来滑动市场。

I'm not sure that there's a magic rule to know when to slide which  but I think founders get slippery with themselves. They aren't totally honest with themselves about  which thing they're doing when.

我不确定是否有一个神奇的规则，知道什么时候滑倒，但我认为创始人会滑倒自己。他们对自己在什么时候做的事情并不完全诚实。

I think it's most important to just recognize that okay,  if we make this shift, we are shifting the audience versus shifting the product.

我认为最重要的是要认识到，好吧，如果我们做出这种转变，我们是在转移受众，而不是转移产品。

I  think otherwise, you can shift the product and the audience simultaneous and think you're doing  well but then realize you're not.

我认为否则，你可以同时转移产品和观众，并认为你做得很好，但后来意识到你不是。

I'm not sure if there's a slam dunk solution  to that other than just being really honest with yourself about which thing you're moving  when. Any other questions? Last chance.

我不确定是否有一个扣篮的解决方案，除了对自己诚实的事情，你什么时候移动。还有其他问题吗？最后一次机会。

Speaker 10: You mentioned that you guys were trying to find product market before you guys find  it, there was a lot of moments where it was kill this product, kill this  product, how do you encourage people on your team to be like let's keep focusing,  the next thing, what do you what do you talk to other people about it?
Peter : I think there's a pretty big difference between finding that first product market fit where  you can kill a product, immediately move to a totally new audience like Codecademy tried  a whole bunch of different stuff. Speaking of switching audiences, they went from like S&B  to programmers to restaurants, all over the place. Later on, when you actually are building  a company around it and you have product managers and each product manager is searching  for a big break through, it's a little bit easier and you can't shift the  audience anymore. The audience is fixed and so now it's a slightly more straightforward problem  for helping a product manager understand how to go talk to customers and reveal what  problems those customers have and then actually solve them.

演讲者10：你们说过在你们找到产品之前，你们正在努力寻找产品市场，有很多时候，他们扼杀了这个产品，你如何鼓励团队中的人像我们一样集中精力，接下来的事情，你会和其他人谈些什么呢？彼得：我认为，找到第一个产品市场适合你可以杀死一个产品，立即转移到一个全新的观众，如科德罗米尝试了一大堆不同的东西，有很大的不同。说到转换观众，他们从像标准普尔一样，从程序员到餐馆，到处都是。后来，当你在公司周围建立一家公司的时候，你有了产品经理，每个产品经理都在寻找一个大突破，这有点容易，你不能再转移观众了。听众是固定的，所以现在帮助产品经理了解如何与客户交谈，并揭示出客户有哪些问题，然后实际解决这些问题，这是一个稍微简单一些的问题。

It's mostly training in that loop  and it comes from talking to either larger customers or your best customers or your  worst customers and trying to push the boundaries around the core of what very happy  people have to what other problems you can solve for them.

这主要是在这个循环中进行的培训，它来自于与更大的客户、最好的客户或最差的客户交谈，并试图把那些非常快乐的人的核心问题推到你能为他们解决的其他问题上。

Speaker 11: When you talk to your customers, what do you ask them? What's your script?
Peter : The question is, when you're talking to customers and trying to understand what their problems  are, what's the script? I think the biggest mistake is trying to pitch your existing  ideas. There's a place for that. Right when you have some product market fit and  you want to test some of these things.

演讲者11：当你和顾客交谈时，你会问他们什么？你的剧本是什么？彼得：问题是，当你和客户交谈，试图了解他们的问题是什么时，剧本是什么？我认为最大的错误是试图推销你现有的想法。那是有地方的。当你有合适的产品市场，你想测试其中的一些东西。

I think most founders and certainly we  made this mistake early on of pitching and trying to sell rather than actually trying  to understand what their problems were so now when I talk to a customer, I  just start by asking them what their business problems are like hey, person at retail  company, do you spend a lot on Facebook, they're like yeah, yeah, yeah. We spend  a lot on Facaebook. Oh, how do you measure if that spend if efficient or  not? They're like well, we don't really know. You're like okay, well is that a  problem? They're like yeah, that's a big problem. Okay, well tell me why you haven't  solved it? They're like well we haven't solved it because blah blah blah. You just  start digging into these problems and you're actually set up to do a sale then.  You're like well I have just the thing! They're like holy crap! If you don't  have a product yet, now you know exactly what problem you can fix.

我认为大多数创始人-当然，我们在早期就犯了这个错误-推销，而不是试图真正理解他们的问题是什么-所以现在当我和一位客户交谈时，我只是问他们的业务问题是什么样的-嘿，零售公司的人，你在Facebook上花了很多钱，他们是这样的，是的。我们花了很多钱买资料簿。哦，你如何衡量这种消费是否有效？他们很好，我们不太清楚。你好像没事，那有问题吗？他们好像是的，这是个大问题。好吧，告诉我你为什么还没解决？我们还没解决这件事是因为废话。你只要开始研究这些问题，你就可以开始做生意了。你就像我有个好东西！他们就像神圣的垃圾！如果你还没有产品，现在你就知道你能解决什么问题了。

I think  it's more about listening and digging than it is about pitching an idea.

我认为更多的是倾听和挖掘，而不是推销一个想法。

Speaker 12: How do you find these customers? How do you be like hey this is my  customer, this company, not this company?
Peter : The question is how do you find these customers? At the beginning it's just emailing,  poll, it's getting interest through everyone you know, it's scratching and clawing your way through  your social network and through introductions. After you have customers in an area then it  gets easier because you have people coming to you all the time, mostly through in  bound and there's a steady stream of people to talk to but the initial piece,  that's why people talk about hustle being such an important founder quality is because no  one's going to help you. You just got to go find them, LinkedIn, investors, friends,  it's whatever you can claw together.

你是如何找到这些顾客的？嘿，这是我的客户，这个公司，不是这个公司？彼得：问题是你怎么找到这些顾客的？一开始，它只是通过电子邮件，民意测验，通过你认识的每一个人来获得兴趣，它是通过你的社交网络和介绍你的抓挠和抓取你的方式。当你在某个地区有了客户之后，事情就变得更容易了，因为你有很多人来找你，大部分时间都是固定的，而且有源源不断的人可以和你交谈，但最初的一部分，这就是为什么人们谈论匆忙是一个如此重要的创办者品质的原因，因为没有人会帮助你。你得去找他们，LinkedIn，投资者，朋友，这是你们能共同掌握的一切。

Speaker 13: At the beginning, when you shoot for these customers, cold emailing them, how many percentage  of people actually come back to you?
Peter : Question is when you cold email customers, what percentage of people come back to you.  I don't remember. That was a while ago. Very low, single digit percentages maybe. You're  going to send a lot of emails that are unanswered. That's the nature of sales  honestly.

演讲者13：一开始，当你为这些顾客拍照时，冷发邮件给他们，到底有多少人会回来找你？彼得：问题是，当你给客户发邮件时，有多少人会回来找你？我不记得了那是很久以前的事了。很低，可能是个位数。你会发送很多没有回复的电子邮件。诚实地说，这就是销售的本质。

If you're selling a business to business environment, you're going to send a lot  of emails that go unanswered. Sales is basically the exercise if you get the door  slammed in your face, nine times out of ten.

如果你要把一家企业卖给商业环境，你会发送很多电子邮件，但这些邮件都没有回复。销售基本上是一种锻炼，如果你被当面砸了门，十次中就有九次。

Speaker 14: What's your where do you think you'll be in five years?
Peter : Back to the diagram. What we have today is basically stream processing so we have  both the ability to collect data across a broad section of stuff here as well  as the ability to fan it out to a bunch of different places. What we  want to do is provide a platform that all of these tools can build on  top of.

演讲者14：你认为五年后你会在哪里？彼得：回到图表。我们今天所拥有的基本上是流处理，所以我们有能力在这里收集广泛的数据，也有能力将数据传播到不同的地方。我们要做的是提供一个平台，所有这些工具都可以在此基础上构建。

It's a super short version. You can imagine every team needs access to  customer data. We want to become the platform on which those tools are built, whether  that's email marketing or push notifications or analytics or help desks or CRMs or payment  systems, fraud detection, et cetera, all of those things operate on a course out of  customer data and that's the customer data that already flows through Segment by nature of  us being that integration connection layer so we just want to expose that data to  partners to build on top of it. When I talked about building a platform at  the beginning, that's the next step for us.

这是个超短的版本。您可以想象每个团队都需要访问客户数据。我们希望成为构建这些工具的平台，无论是电子邮件营销，还是推送通知或分析，帮助服务台或CRMS，还是支付系统，欺诈检测等等，所有这些东西都是在客户数据之外的过程中运行的，而这是已经从我们的本质上通过分段的客户数据，因此我们是集成的连接层。只是想向合作伙伴公开这些数据，以便在此基础上进行构建。当我一开始谈论建立一个平台的时候，这是我们下一步的工作。

Speaker 15: Peter, we're out of time. Thank you very much.


彼得，我们没时间了。非常感谢
