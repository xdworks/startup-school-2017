# How to Find Product Market Fit - Peter Reinhardt

Speaker 1: Today we have Peter Reinhardt. He's the CEO of Segment, went through YC ... When?
Peter : 2011.

Speaker 1: 2011. Now Segment is doing extremely well. Peter is going to talk about product market  fit, this magic concept where people don't really understand it. Certainly the first job to  get right in any start up. Peter, thank you very much for coming to talk  to us and look forward to hearing this.

Peter : I'm going to talk about finding product market fit. Segment is a Be to Be  company so that's probably why none of you have ever heard of us but just  to give you a little sense, we're about 150 people and grew from about four  people three and a half years ago. Growing quickly and hopefully I can shed some  light on finding product market fit for you. I thought just start by looking back  to Alan Kay's lecture. I think he had some pretty incredible advice on how to  do really amazing research by looking into the future and imagining what that future might  be like. In particular, he had this diagram of exploring the pink plain and testing  out different ideas there and then at some point having a break through and realizing  that there's a blue plain and you can go explore an entirely new space and  that that's a key break through for understanding how you can really invent that future.  In particular, he had this idea of going into the future and imagining yourself there.  He had this Wayne Gretzky idea of skating to where the puck should be or  will be and going there, grabbing that future and then pulling it back to the  present. The way that he talks about doing this is I think amazing for research.  He talks about basically going and imagining that future world but I'd actually wager that  not a single successful company has been founded by doing that. I think again, awesome  for research but when it comes to founding companies, it actually has nothing to do  with imagining your vision for the future and what that future could be. It's not  about how you wish the world was but it's actually about what customers want. I  think a lot of companies get marketed post facto of hey, we have this great  idea and here's how we deductively logic'ed out what customers were going to want and  then we built the thing but in reality, that's not how it works at all.  In reality, it's a very inductive process. You're going back and forth with customers and  you eventually find something that works. I wanted to talk a little bit about that  process today and just how critical it is and actually how difficult it is too.  One of the most common mistakes that start ups make is to build something that  no one wants or solve problems that no one has and so that Wayne Gretzky  method for going into the future and imagining what that future might look like, again,  it's a good idea for research, it might even be a good idea for venture  capitalist, to imagine what the future is like and put start ups into different buckets  of what building that future might look at but I actually think it's a bad  strategy for founders. The reason is that most founders can actually pretty easily build something  that looks like it's from the future or is from the future to some extent  like it's easy to solve the technology problem there but it's actually really difficult. It's  not really what you need to do. You don't need to build something that is  your vision of the future, you actually need to solve a specific problem that customers  have today, here, now. Most start ups actually fail to do that. Most start ups  actually build something that looks vaguely futuristic but is not in fact a real problem  that people have today. It'll kill the company every time. The market always wins. We're  going to dig into that a little bit more and this problem of finding product  market fit stat 80%, 80% of all founders failed to find product market fit so  four out of five attempts to found a company just fail at this earlier stage  of even finding a problem that you can solve in a unique way. The last  one out of five, we're going to struggle through the remainder of actually building that  company up from there but that's just the stats. I'll share our own story of  finding product market fit but the short version is that it actually feels when you're  not finding product market fit. It feels like a bottomless, emotionless, freefall, not to get  too dark. When you're failing to find it, it becomes a strange obsession and it  could really make you sick actually. To get a little maybe too personal for a  second, in 2012, in the midst of our search for product market fit, I lost  10 pounds in three weeks and went to the hospital twice for panic attacks. I  haven't had a panic attack before or since then and I think it's not just  me actually. I think Sam, I don't know if I should show this or not  but when he was founding Looped, I think he basically forgot to eat properly and  ended up with Scurvy. Sam's back there somewhere. Be warned, finding product market fit is  very emotionally a grind. The reason it is is that you really, really desperately want  to find that fit. You really want to figure out what is going to work.  What is something that customers want. We're all wired to want to succeed to help  people like that. You're so intent on finding this thing that you convince yourself into  seeing mirages of it. You convince yourself this is the thing, we're almost there. This  is something that people really want. This is a picture of myself with my three  co-founders, Ilya, Calvin and Ian, in the summer of 2012 I think and this is  in the midst of our deepest false hopes that we had found something. We'll dive  into that story. Obviously I'm here to day because it worked out. I wouldn't be  speaking if we just disappeared into the darkness. Today we're about 150 in and growing  rapidly.

Speaker 3: How can you make sure you're finding the big market and not just a small  niche
Peter : That's a good question. I think PG's advice on this is good and valid which  is it's actually harder to find the first problem and solve any problem well than  to find a route out so finding a route out from some initial foothold into  a broad market is actually not that hard. Sounds hard but once you find any  foothold, you can pretty much find something and I can cover that a little bit  in a bit.

Speaker 3: Is that because you have more leverage
Peter : It turns that once you solve a problem for a customer, they'll keep bringing you  more problems. The most efficient thing for them to do is just say well I  have this other problem that's also adjacent to it, can you solve that? You're like  oh, sure. I'll solve that and you keep solving adjacent problems. Once you find one  thing, it's actually almost trivial to find the next thing and the next thing and  the next thing especially selling to other business where you have someone who can just  tell you more stuff. Much harder in consumer, I'm the wrong guy to talk to  about consumer stuff. I don't get it. Back then, we're just four dudes in an  apartment. We're failing to find product market fit. We were convincing ourselves that maybe we  had it or we were on the cusp of it and we were writing a  lot of code. I saw someone who was writing code. We were writing a lot  of code and we had no customers. That's the wrong order of operations and so  we were tricking ourselves into this and in reality, what the good thing that was  going on here, the reality was that we were a bunch of cockroaches and the  reason is that it's very important, pre product market fit to save as much cash  as possible, spend as little as possible and extend your runways as long as possible.  A lot of founders make a mistake of spending a bunch on sales or marketing  or other things as soon as they have an idea but in reality, until you  find product market fit, until you find something that people want, you shouldn't be spending  any time on that. You should just be spending time talking with customers and iterating  and you really want to constrain your runway or constrain your burns so you can  have a really long runway. That's what we did. We kept our burn really low.  I think we paid ourselves the minimum allowable amount by law which was 20 or  30k a year. We lived in our apartment/office. The company paid for part of it  as an office. It was the minimal thing. We stretched out our runway through as  many ideas as we could. To make this process a little bit more explicit, step  one is that you build launch and iterate on several different ideas and this is  where it's really important to be a cockroach where you're conserving everything you have. Then  suddenly something magical happens. We'll talk about that and this is product market fit and  it really does feel magical. Hopefully I can illustrate to you and help you feel  that. Three, product market fit suddenly turns you into a unicorn/cockroach and rather than just  surviving after product market fit, everything gets suddenly easier. Not easy but easier. Customers show  up and buy your thing. People want to join your team. You're still pushing the  boulder up hill, if you will, but you're not totally constrained on progress. You can  actually feel forward momentum for the first time. It's not one step forward at the  product idea, full step back when a customer doesn't care. You actually can keep iterating  on a product that's starting to work. Let's take that middle portion and let's deconstruct  it a little bit. First we're going to deconstruct what we call category leaders. These  are really large companies that have been very successful. We'll get to the heart of  why product market fit is so important at the very beginning and then we'll talk  about what bad fit feels like, bad product market fit and then we'll talk about  what good product market fit feels like. We'll try to do that through stories. The  goal here is for you to walk away and be able to more easily identify  which is which with your own ideas. Category leaders. The reason we care about category  leaders is that they're much, much larger than the rest of the companies out there.  I'll give you an example. Amazon and Facebook are consumer companies that you might be  familiar with. Sales Force is a company that sells to other business that provides sales  software. The reason that we're interested in them is that they're huge. They're often 10  or a 1000 times larger than the next competitor in the space. Sales Force for  example, you have probably heard of, Sugar CRM, and Zoho are probably companies you've never  heard of. They all do roughly the same thing and so we want to dig  into how can you build a category leader. What's the layer underneath that. What it  comes down to is building a platform where it's not just a product that you're  selling but where the data inside of your product is actually useful for other business  to build their business on top of yours. That's what Sales Force has done, that's  what Amazon has done, that's what Facebook has done. If you look at Sales Force,  they have something called the app exchange. The app exchange reveals all the data inside  of Sales Force and allows other companies to build marketing and sales products on top  of that. Similarly, Amazon has the reseller program where now there's tons of other businesses  built on top of Amazon. The key here is having some sort of platform eventually,  when you get to scale, having some sort of platform that other companies are building  on, selling, and by nature of that, pulls people into your ecosystem but how do  you build a platform like that? I know Peter Thiel may not be the most  popular right now but his opinion is that to build a sustainable and compelling platform,  you really need to get to $100 million in revenue. The reason is just that  you need to be at a scale where someone actually can capture a couple percentage  points of your customer base and build a real business themselves. If they can capture  a couple percentage points, say two to three million in revenue, that's a real business.  You can build something on top of that. You want to build a category leader.  To do that, you need a platform to do that, you need 100 million in  revenue so let's keep digging. 100 million in revenue is tough so let's keep digging  down. I think you met Jason Lumpkin a couple weeks ago, am I right? Maybe  he's coming soon. He's written some amazing stuff about building softwares of service business. Would  highly recommend reading all his answers on Quora. He breaks down the path to 100  million in revenue in three different steps. He says zero to one million is impossible.  One to 10 million is improbable and 10 to 100 is inevitable. He says that  10 to 100 is inevitable because at that point, there's just so much momentum. You  have customers out there who are singing you praises. They're buying, their companies are going  to buy more. It might take you a while but eventually you're going to get  from 10 to 100. One to 10 million I think is always a brutal grind  for the founders and the reason is that you're running a real business. You have  real customers, you have some scale, your customers have reasonable demands about how the quality  of service that they expect from the product but the problem is that pre 10  million in revenue, you have a really tough time attracting a world class management team.  You can't hire a great exec team yet because the large enough market isn't there.  What you have is the early crew holding the ship together and trying to make  sure that it's going to work. It's a very tough period I think for most  founders to scale through and then zero to one million is impossible because this is  finding product market fit and 80% or more people fail at that first step. The  question is, how can you actually make it through that impossible section and become one  of the ones that succeeds and one of the things that people talk about as  investors or founders is how important it is to learn from failure. I recently read  a pretty good study talking about the stats of an actual analysis of failure and  success and start ups and finding product market fit. The research shows that you're actually  no more likely to succeed the second time around if you fail the first time.  If you fail in finding product market fit the first time, your odds of success  are still 20 or 22% the second time around but if you succeed in finding  product market it, the chances of your success the second time around go from 22%  to 34% which is still miserable but it's at least 50% better so what I  think that means is that there's actually not that much information encoded in finding product  market fit. You don't actually learn that much but there's quite a bit encoded in  feeling the success of understanding what did work. When we were struggling to find product  market fit in 2011 and 2012, I felt this really acutely. We had failed multiple  times at this point but I still didn't feel like I knew what I was  looking for. What is this mystical product market fit thing? It's so frustrating and we  kept seeing glimmers of hope. We kept convincing ourselves that this, that or the other  thing, a visitor chatting with us on our site was a big deal or vaguely  interested sales prospect was product market fit and so without any positive product market fit  examples, we didn't really know what it looked like so we could convince ourselves with  everything. The way I think about it now, I really, desperately, if you imagine a  machine learning model, I had a bunch of negative training set examples and I had  no positive training set examples so of course, my machine learning algorithm was like oh,  no. I'm now going to walk through three stories. I showed you two examples of  failure, actually five ish stories. Two examples of failure and then three examples on the  positive side of times we did feel product market fit and again, my goal is  for you to actually feel what this feels like so you can identify it in  your own product. Today's segment is a customer data platform but we actually started as  an education tool. It was designed for lectures like this. This is us coding in  our mountain view apartment in the summer of 2011 and the idea was that as  a professor, standing up, talking to a class, you have no idea if anyone in  the audience actually understands what you're saying and so we were students at the time  at MIT in Rhode Island School of Design. We said what we really want to  do is give students a button to push where they can say I'm confused or  I get it, either one and the professor would see this graph overtime of how  confused the students were. Might be helpful to me right now. We built this. We  were at hundreds of thousands of lines of code. It had commenting and nodes and  all sorts of crazy stuff and we actually came to Stanford's campus, might have even  been in this hall, convinced some professors. We would run up to them after class,  this is a picture from Berkeley. We pounced on this professor right after class. We  were testing for product market fit. We were trying to convince the professor like did  you get any feedback from your class during this class, no. Okay, well we have  a solution for you. We were hustling to try to get people to use this  tool but we were mostly ignoring any test of real product market fit there and  so professors would agree to test it out for a few lectures, out of pity  maybe for some students who were from MIT, who were trying to help. We thought  that this was product market fit but it really wasn't and I'll show you why  because if you stand in the back of the classroom and look at what people  actually had on their screens, none of them were using the product. People were using  all these different things. This is that same class at Berkeley the next week, by  the way. It was horrifying. As soon as the students opened their laptops, they all  went and did other things. Putting a laptop into the classroom was the most distracting  thing you could conceivably do. As you can imagine, this was pretty horrifying. One of  the more embarrassing things that could have happened to us, we had just raised 600k  coming out of and we had sold this vision of this is how the future  of classrooms is going to work. It's going to be digital. It's going to be  online, much as this is a , et cetera. It was a great vision but  again, the market wins every time. It doesn't matter what your vision is. It matters  what the market actually wants. In this case, the students didn't care. The students didn't  get that much value out of using the tool. If you go back, we should've  hadn't even earlier warning sign which is that the professors didn't really want to use  the tool either. You go and talk to the professors. They would sort of out  of pity agree to test it for a few lectures but that is not the  same thing as product market fit where they're like holy crap, that solves this problem  that I have. It's sort of bullying customers into using your product is not anything  close to product market fit even if they reticently agree to do it. I think  being dismissive of users and having your clear vision of the future isn't necessarily solving  a problem for your customers. It's a pretty stunning failure on our part and it's  a key thing that founder do again, and again, and again and their search for  product market fit. Then we had to do the awkward thing which by the way  is the right thing of calling back all the investors and saying ... This was  four weeks after they'd sign the checks, by the way, turns out this is a  terrible idea. We're going to do something. Do you want your money back? In most  of these cases, the investors did not take their money back. They said we invested  for the team like go find another idea. We believe in you guys. Go find  something else. We said okay, let's do it. We were all committed, very committed to  working together as a team of four founders. We shut down the lecture tool. We  went and shut it down in all the classrooms. We went back to the whiteboard  and we said what is something that is interesting here and we had always felt  that we should have been able to determine that we didn't have product market fit  that the product usage wasn't there from our actual data. The way we figured this  out was we went and stood in the classroom, back where Sam is and looked  at what was on all the laptop screens and that was how we figured out  if we had product market fit or not. We should have been able to do  that with the data. We should have been able to look at the analytics and  figure out not only are people using it or not but our anthropology class is  using it different than computer science classes. We decided to build an analytics tool which  it turns out is a bad idea in case anyone is considering that. The way  that we approached this is, how many of you have read the book Lean Start  Up? Wow, that's actually awesome. Y'all are way far ahead. As Lean Start Up talking  about, you want to get out of the building and actually talk to customers. We  read that right around this moment and we were like we're going to go out  and talk to customers. We did that and we tried to validate our ideas so  we'd take people out for coffee and we'd pull people from companies and try to  figure out if they were interested in analytics products. I'd say again and again, they  were vaguely interested and they had willingness to meet and chat with us and they  said they wanted product updates as things came out. We thought this must be it,  this must be product market fit where people are interested in what we're doing. Again,  this is not product market fit. This is idle interest. Very, very big difference. Based  on this idle interest, we got very excited and we spent the next six months  just writing codes. This is in a new office. That's my co-founder, Calvin and Ilya.  As you can see, there's lots of code on our screen. Again, wrong order of  operations. I had gone on one sales trip to visit potential customers and they were  all pretty happy with mixed panel and Google analytics but they had these edge case  features that they were hoping that we could solve and so I tricked myself into  believing that these little edge cases that we might be able to solve were actually  really a wide gap that we could fill as a product. I came back and  I pitched to my co-founders and we would keep believing that we were almost there  if we just ship one more feature, one more thing, we're going to get to  product market fit. Again, bad idea. We used lots of little positive interactions like this.  You can also read this not as a positive interaction but every once in a  while, some stray person would visit our website and they'd open a chat. This is  idle interest. Hey, what's Segment? This is a complete transcript of that website chat. You  can see it's 3 AM so we're up late coding. This person is interested so  maybe this is product market fit. Again, this is not what it looks like. This  is just idle interest. It's not December 2012. We've been at this for about a  year and a half and we decided that something was wrong. Clearly this was not  working. We went back to YC. We emailed Paul Graham and we said hey, we  think we should catch up and explain what's happened over the last year and a  half. Okay great. So we go, this is us in front of the old YC  building. We're walking around the little cul-de-sac by YC on Pioneer Way. We're bringing him  up to speed. We spent half a million dollars. Here's everything we've been through over  the last couple of years and as we're walking around, he comes to a stop  and he looks at us and he says so just to be clear, you've spent  half a million dollars and you have nothing to show for it. Totally accurate and  super fair and shocked us into oh, shit, we got to do something. That was  the moment where we realized we had hit rock bottom but we still had 100k  left so we still got one more shot. That was all the product market fit  failure cases. Now you're going to see some success but let's rewind. Let's go all  the way back to the first week of YC. In that first week, we had  been like well, we have this classroom lecture tool and we should have analytics on  it so we looked at the different analytics tools, case metrics, Google analytics, mixed panel  and we were looking at what's similar here and we saw they have different graphs  and different APIs but it's actually the same data going into all these tools. They  give you different stuff out the other end. We don't really want to make a  business decision here about which tool we want to use so we'll just solve the  engineering problem because we're engineers. We'll just build some code that sends data to all  three and does this automatic translation so we put one data point in, it gets  translated into three API calls that go out to all three services. Cool, this was  100 lines of code and the hundreds of thousands that we wrote. Set that aside.  Then about four months later, it gets improved a little bit, four months later, it  gets improved a little bit, at that point, we are trying to sell our own  analytics tool akin to mixed panel and Google analytics. We keep encountering the sales objection  when we're trying to sell it which is I already have mixed panel installed. I  don't really want to install your tool. It seems like a lot of work so  my co-founder Ilya has this great idea. He says what if we take that little  library road a year ago that we've totally forgotten about and we add ourselves as  the fourth service that it can send data too and then every time somebody hits  us with that objection, we hit them with the open source library and we say  okay, great now you can try them both in parallel and we use it as  like a growth hack to get customers to start adopting our tool. Okay great. We  started doing that. We start sending it out, people start replying. This is awesome. I  love the library. I'm definitely going to use it. Few weeks later, we follow up.  Hey, we saw that you're still not sending any data to Segment.io, what's going on.  They're like well the library is fantastic. I just don't really want to use your  analytics service. Should have taken note right then but few months go by, people start  starring us on GetHub. It was a big deal for us at the time, 30  stars. I think maybe there was one poor request issued and then fast forward some  more, people keep paying attention. It's the first time we ever felt pull. People were  finding this thing and doing something with it and fast forward, we have this conversation  with PG. The next day, we sit down and we're like all right. We need  a new idea. My co-founder Ian is like you know what? I have an idea.  Remember that analytics library that has been idling on GetHub, I think that could be  a big business. I was like you've got to be kidding me. That's the worst  idea I've ever heard. First of all it's open source. Second of all, it's 580  lines of codes. Who the heck is going to pay for that? How do you  build a business around that? It makes no sense. We're fighting and fighting and fighting  and I went home and I was wracking my brain like how can I kill  this idea? It's really bad. It's going to sink us. We only have one more  shot. I came in the next day and I was like here's what we're going  to do. We're going to build a landing page. It's going to be an awesome  landing page. It's going to be beautiful. We're going to put up it on Hackernews.  It's going to pitch the product and I'll have an email sign up form at  the bottom and we'll use this to test whether it's a good idea or not.  They agree like okay, great. Totally done. We get ready to launch it on Hackernews.  I'm starting to think about other ideas and it goes straight to the top. It  gets about 300 up votes on Hackernews. It gets a few thousand stars of GetHub.  We have people reaching out to us on LinkedIn demanding access to the beta. This  guy says what does a brother have to do to get bumped up on your  beta list? There were others like this. Holy crap. Full stop. Compare this to everything  previously. Everything changed. This is what product market fit looks like where it's not just  a single metric slowly starts moving, it's not just a few random conversations where people  express vague interest. Every single metric went totally haywire. With our lecture tool and our  analytics tool, we've been searching in the dark for what features to build next. We  did not have that problem anymore. There were thousands of people who had signed up  and they're like you're seven integrations are good but I need these 10 more and  I'm deploying it tomorrow on blah blah, holy crap, slow down. That's actually one of  the key things. One of the key things is that it flips from being something  that you're pushing against the customer to all of a sudden, the customer's running away  with it like hold on, wait, it's not quite ready yet. Another example with our  analytics tool, we had this sad unanswered questions and chats. No one really seemed to  care about what we had built but now we had thousands of stars, people wishing  poll requests, we got 10 poll requests in the first 48 hours or something like  that. I guess the other key thing is with our lecture tool and with our  analytics tool. We had this huge vision, we had this vision of here's how the  classroom should operate. Here's how companies should do analytics. We went about trying to build  a product that fit the vision but this was the total opposite. This was a  little tiny library that we built for ourselves that solved a real problem, had no  vision associated with it whatsoever at the beginning. Now it does because we have something  that we want to go accomplish but at the beginning it solves the tiniest of  tiny problems and it's your question earlier, this is that tiny little foothold and again,  it's an open source library with 580 lines of code. That's a foothold and since  then, we've expanded greatly into doing all sorts of things and solving adjacent problems for  customers. The market doesn't care at all what your vision of the world is. The  market wants what it wants and it will win every time. If you walk away  with one thing today, I think let's be incredible that basically product market fit doesn't  feel like vague idle interest. It doesn't feel like a glimmer of hope from some  earlier conversation. It doesn't feel like a trickle of people signing up. It really feels  like everything in your business has gone totally haywire. There's a big rush of adrenaline  from customers starting to adopt it and ripping it out of your hands. It feels  like the market is dragging you forward. I think the dropbox founders said this best  that product market fit feels like stepping on a landmine. You can't mistake the two  so if you are at all questioning if you have product market fit or not,  you don't. Obviously that didn't stop us from making this mistake so just to make  sure that ... Wait this is backwards, oh no, it's not. I thought class metric  for sure had product market fit. Big vision. Market said no. Market doesn't care what  you think. I thought Segment io for sure had great market fit. Again, market said  no. Market doesn't care. Market wins. Even on our third attempt when we did find  product market fit, I thought for sure, this is too tiny to matter but it  actually solved a real problem and the market demanded it and ripped it out of  our hands. Either that goes to show how obtuse I am or how hard it  is to find product market fit.

Speaker 4: How come people lack the taste for something that was open source
Peter : Good question. It turns out that the open source library-  Oh, sorry. The question is why would someone pay anything for an open source library  that's 580 lines of code. Good question. It turns out that the open source library  by itself doesn't totally solve the problem so the actual problem that we found out  that we were solving after we launched it was that marketing teams keep coming to  engineering departments and saying I just signed a contract with exact target, an email marketing  tool or I just signed a contract with W analytics. Here's the docs. The engineering  team says what the heck, I have a roadmap. I need to be executing on  this other thing. I can't do this analytics implementation and what really needed to happen  and what analytics js could solve the problem that we could solve is the hosted  version is allowing engineers to do a single implementation of collecting that data once and  then letting marketers just push buttons in our interface to send the data wherever they  need it but the open source library doesn't solve that problem. Engineers saw that it  was the right abstraction but if a marketer needed a new tool and there was  no preserved version, the engineer still has to go compile it. In some ways, we  got lucky that the open sourced version doesn't fully solve the problem. I'm going to  steal gratuitously from Allan Kay's slides again. I think finding product market fit feels a  lot like finding this blue plane when you're in the pink plane. I want to  give some other examples of finding product market fit after finding that initial product market  fit. They key difference from that initial break through from what Allan Kay was talking  about was that rather than removing yourself from the world and trying to imagine what  the future is like, you actually need to go out into the world and research  what problems people really have. Once you find that product, once you find that blue  plane, then things actually get enormously easier. That blue plane is a foothold into a  totally new perspective and I think Allan Kay talked about the value of perspective on  context should it get this foothold into a new way of thinking about the world,  a new way of solving some problem for someone and so not only do you  know what good fit feels like but you now are operating in green pastures and  you're approaching problems in ways that all the incumbents in the pink plane don't think  about the world. I wanted to give you two examples of finding product market fit  since that initial win for us. Short intro to what Segment does, we help people  collect data from mobile apps and websites. We pull it up to Segment and we  fan it out to all the different tools that you need. That's all you really  need to know. One of the places where we could send data was Amazon S3.  This is a place to put all your log files. We started to notice that  all our business tier customers were using this one integration. They were all sending their  data to S3 but you have to do something with the data. You don't just  collect log files. You do something with log files. We were like what the heck  is going on here so we went and visited five of our largest customers in  New York, this was about three years ago and we said okay, you're using the  S3 integration but what the heck are you using it for? For five out of  five customers in a row, they said well we have a data engineering team that's  taking data from the S3 bucket, converting it into CS view files and managing all  the schema-translations and now they're uploading it into a data warehouse like Redshift. The first  time I heard that from a customer, I was like okay, that's interesting. I took  a note, went to the second meeting, customer said the exactly same thing. I said  that's weird. Taking note. Third conversation, I was like this is getting ridiculous. Did you  guys talk ahead of time or what happened here? By the fifth time, obviously I  know what we need to build. We just need to build a connection from this,  straight to Redshift. Then the question we went and built that and just to show  you now, now we have a company that here in millions of dollars in revenue.  We have a real product that real people are using. What does product market fit  look like at that point? We're introducing a second product basically. It looks like this.  You can tell when we introduced Redshift. Again, almost every metric in the business goes  nuts so it's very, very clear whether or not you have something that is really  transformative for your customers or not. One more story and then I will open it  up for Q and A. This is maybe about five months ago, we had five  ideas for products that we thought might be exciting to our customers so I went  to visit a customer up large company, up in the Pacific Northwest. I sat down  with a data architect there and I said okay, here are the five ideas that  I want to run through and see if they're interesting to you. I went through  the first idea and he was like yeah, you know what? I totally get it.  That sounds super valuable. I went through the second one and he's like that's really  cool. That's cool that you can do that. That makes a lot of sense. Third  idea, fourth idea, same kind of thing. This is how I would summarize that. That's  great. I totally understand where the value is means yeah ... That would be great.  Doesn't care is what that is code for. That's someone being nice. On the fifth  idea, I said hey, here's what we can do, blah blah blah, and he said  wait, sorry, you can do what? I re-explained it and he said oh, interesting and  he said can you set up a follow up meeting with this team, this team,  and this team? We also need to tell Joe about this because it could affect  this other thing and that again, that is the feeling of product market fit. You're  like wait, wait, no, no, it doesn't exist yet. These are ideas. All of a  sudden the customer is just going to rip it out of you and so now  you're on a tight timeline because the customer expects that it already exists. Again, that's  what product market fit actually feels like. I think if you want to find product  market fit and build one of these category leading companies, become one out of the  five founders that actually does succeed in finding this, I think you just need to  be really honest with yourself that the glimmers of false hope that you have is  not the same as customers ripping something out of your hands. You just need to  be honest with yourself. That's the message. Questions? Yeah, Sam?
Sam: I certainly agree, it's been my experience that product market fit is like but when  you're trying to find it, for what kind of ideas to try when you're just  casting around, looking for ideas?
Peter : I actually think that the bigger problem is not necessarily having the ideas. I think  everyone has lots of interesting ideas. I think the bigger problem is not killing the  bad ideas fast enough. I have the most respect for the Codecademy founders in this  respect. I think they tried 12 ideas in seven weeks or something like that, in  the summer of YC. It was something totally absurd but they tried them and killed  them so fast and then four days before demo day, they started a new idea  which was Codecademy and then it worked. On launch day, on demo day, they had  300,000 users or something like that. That's the landmine effect of nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,  nothing, nothing and they were so good about killing the ideas. They had no problem  throwing out something that wasn't going to work. I don't think there's any magic to  finding the right idea. If you just kill the bad ideas fast enough, you'll probably  find something.

Speaker 8: Talk a little bit about pricing. It seems like with 500 lines of code and  solving a significant but small problem, I don't know if that's the way to describe  it. How do you go about pricing something like that when you're doing that customer  discovery?
Peter : The question is how do you go about pricing something like this where it's 500  lines of code, it seems like it solves a small problem for people? We thought  it was a small problem for people and we underpriced hugely for a long time.  It turns out that that problem that the 500 lines of code solves, is actually  really valuable. We have lots of customers that pay over $100,000 a year to solve  that problem. There's more to the product now than the 500 lines of code, a  lot more but it's nevertheless is ... The size is the business problem. It's almost  nothing to do with the amount of code written. I think it did take us  a little while to revalue things in that respect. To answer your question most directly,  we spent the first year just accumulating customers. We just had a lot of people  adopting it. Got to maybe 1000 or 2000 companies sending data through Segment and then  we tried experimenting with pricing and then I'd say the biggest kick in the but  to get to the right point here is we had a sales advisor who said  ... There were reasonably sized companies using us like LiveNation and Ardio and stuff like  that. We would go to sales meetings at these companies and the sales advisor would  get me pumped up ahead of time. He'd be like Peter, you have to ask  for $120,000 a year. I'm like that's crazy. What are you talking about? He's like  Peter, if you don't ask for $120,000 a year, I'm quitting as your sales advisor.  I was like well, all right. Here we go. I would ask, I'd turn beet  red and they would negotiate it down to 18k. If you keep doing it, eventually  someone is like well that seems reasonable. You have to keep testing the value like  that. You don't know how much value you're delivering until you start asking for money.  I think if I had to do it over again, I'd start asking for money  earlier and I'd be a lot more comfortable with it like if you're solving a  real business problem, people are going to be happy to pay for it. I'm not  sure if I totally answered your question.

Speaker 9: How do you know that you're asking the right people about said product? What if  just a small shift and who you should be asking that you're not realizing how  did you-
Peter : The question is how do you know whether you're asking the right people and how  do you know whether you should slightly shift who you're talking to versus shift the  product? This is why it's so hard to find product market fit the first time  and why it's so much easier the second time once you have some product market  fit because once you do have a defined customer set that you sell to, you  can pretty easily figure out by going back to the same people whether or not  you're solving an adjacent problem for them. It's really hard. The thing that makes it  super hard at the beginning is that it's like you have two things and you  can either slide the product or you can slide the market by talking to different  people. I'm not sure that there's a magic rule to know when to slide which  but I think founders get slippery with themselves. They aren't totally honest with themselves about  which thing they're doing when. I think it's most important to just recognize that okay,  if we make this shift, we are shifting the audience versus shifting the product. I  think otherwise, you can shift the product and the audience simultaneous and think you're doing  well but then realize you're not. I'm not sure if there's a slam dunk solution  to that other than just being really honest with yourself about which thing you're moving  when. Any other questions? Last chance.

Speaker 10: You mentioned that you guys were trying to find product market before you guys find  it, there was a lot of moments where it was kill this product, kill this  product, how do you encourage people on your team to be like let's keep focusing,  the next thing, what do you what do you talk to other people about it?
Peter : I think there's a pretty big difference between finding that first product market fit where  you can kill a product, immediately move to a totally new audience like Codecademy tried  a whole bunch of different stuff. Speaking of switching audiences, they went from like S&B  to programmers to restaurants, all over the place. Later on, when you actually are building  a company around it and you have product managers and each product manager is searching  for a big break through, it's a little bit easier and you can't shift the  audience anymore. The audience is fixed and so now it's a slightly more straightforward problem  for helping a product manager understand how to go talk to customers and reveal what  problems those customers have and then actually solve them. It's mostly training in that loop  and it comes from talking to either larger customers or your best customers or your  worst customers and trying to push the boundaries around the core of what very happy  people have to what other problems you can solve for them.

Speaker 11: When you talk to your customers, what do you ask them? What's your script?
Peter : The question is, when you're talking to customers and trying to understand what their problems  are, what's the script? I think the biggest mistake is trying to pitch your existing  ideas. There's a place for that. Right when you have some product market fit and  you want to test some of these things. I think most founders and certainly we  made this mistake early on of pitching and trying to sell rather than actually trying  to understand what their problems were so now when I talk to a customer, I  just start by asking them what their business problems are like hey, person at retail  company, do you spend a lot on Facebook, they're like yeah, yeah, yeah. We spend  a lot on Facaebook. Oh, how do you measure if that spend if efficient or  not? They're like well, we don't really know. You're like okay, well is that a  problem? They're like yeah, that's a big problem. Okay, well tell me why you haven't  solved it? They're like well we haven't solved it because blah blah blah. You just  start digging into these problems and you're actually set up to do a sale then.  You're like well I have just the thing! They're like holy crap! If you don't  have a product yet, now you know exactly what problem you can fix. I think  it's more about listening and digging than it is about pitching an idea.

Speaker 12: How do you find these customers? How do you be like hey this is my  customer, this company, not this company?
Peter : The question is how do you find these customers? At the beginning it's just emailing,  poll, it's getting interest through everyone you know, it's scratching and clawing your way through  your social network and through introductions. After you have customers in an area then it  gets easier because you have people coming to you all the time, mostly through in  bound and there's a steady stream of people to talk to but the initial piece,  that's why people talk about hustle being such an important founder quality is because no  one's going to help you. You just got to go find them, LinkedIn, investors, friends,  it's whatever you can claw together.

Speaker 13: At the beginning, when you shoot for these customers, cold emailing them, how many percentage  of people actually come back to you?
Peter : Question is when you cold email customers, what percentage of people come back to you.  I don't remember. That was a while ago. Very low, single digit percentages maybe. You're  going to send a lot of emails that are unanswered. That's the nature of sales  honestly. If you're selling a business to business environment, you're going to send a lot  of emails that go unanswered. Sales is basically the exercise if you get the door  slammed in your face, nine times out of ten.

Speaker 14: What's your where do you think you'll be in five years?
Peter : Back to the diagram. What we have today is basically stream processing so we have  both the ability to collect data across a broad section of stuff here as well  as the ability to fan it out to a bunch of different places. What we  want to do is provide a platform that all of these tools can build on  top of. It's a super short version. You can imagine every team needs access to  customer data. We want to become the platform on which those tools are built, whether  that's email marketing or push notifications or analytics or help desks or CRMs or payment  systems, fraud detection, et cetera, all of those things operate on a course out of  customer data and that's the customer data that already flows through Segment by nature of  us being that integration connection layer so we just want to expose that data to  partners to build on top of it. When I talked about building a platform at  the beginning, that's the next step for us.

Speaker 15: Peter, we're out of time. Thank you very much.
