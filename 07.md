# How to Build a Product IV - Jan Koum

Sam: Today's speaker, we have Jan Koum. Jan is the founder of WhatsApp. Whatsapp, as we  mentioned in an earlier iteration of this, is the startup that did everything right. After  not trying to get jobs at Facebook, and not, for either Jan or Brian, they  put their heads down, they figured a product that people really wanted, and while everybody  else in Silicon Valley was going to conferences, doing PR, whatever else it is people  do other than making a product that people really love, WhatsApp just quietly built this  thing that was used by ... How many people by the time of the acquisition?
Jan Koum: 450.

山姆：今天的演讲者是简·库姆。简是WhatsApp的创始人。WhatsApp，正如我们在之前的一次迭代中提到的，是一家做好一切事情的初创公司。在没有试图在Facebook找到工作，也没有，不管是简还是布莱恩，他们都低下了头，发现了一种人们真正想要的产品。当硅谷的其他人都去参加会议，做公关，除了制作人们真正喜欢的产品以外，其他人都在做其他事情，WhatsApp只是悄悄地打造了这款产品，被人们使用.收购时有多少人？简·库姆：450岁。

Sam: 450 million people for a consumer app, and more than a billion now, and was  acquired by Facebook a couple of years ago, and Jan can tell that story, but  thank you very much for coming to talk with us.

山姆：4.5亿消费者应用，现在超过10亿，几年前被Facebook收购，简可以讲述这个故事，但非常感谢你能来和我们交谈。

Jan Koum: Sure. Thanks for having me. So, when someone asked to come and speak here, I  think I made some smart-ass comment how I'm going to speak about people actually building  a product and not going to class, or something like that. But as Sam mentioned,  we were just fortunate in a way that we stumbled into something that people really  wanted, and I'll explain in a second how we got there, but the credit really  goes to not necessarily us having some brilliant idea.

简·库姆：当然。谢谢你邀请我。所以，当有人要求在这里发言时，我想我做了一些聪明的评论-我将要谈论的是人们实际上是在构建一个产品，而不是去上课，或者诸如此类的事情。但正如Sam提到的，我们只是幸运地偶然遇到了人们真正想要的东西，我马上就会解释我们是如何到达那里的，但我们的功劳并不一定是我们有了一些聪明的想法。

I think the credit goes to  also being in the right time, at the right place, and building a product that  people wanted, and just realizing that people wanted it. So just to kind of give  the history of how we got where we got, we actually ... Both me, and  my girlfriend, and Brian, we were at Yahoo for about ...

我认为这也归功于在正确的时间，在正确的地点，并建立一个人们想要的产品，而只是意识到人们想要它。为了让我们了解一下我们是怎么得到的，我们实际上.我，我女朋友，和布莱恩，我们在雅虎待了大约.

I was there for  9 years, he was there for 11 years, and that time was actually really, really  valuable for us to learn how to scale back on servers, what makes a good  product, what makes a bad product, and seeing the Yahoo as a company get really  successful, and them to start. We left in 2007, just coincidentally we both left around  the same time, like within a month difference, and we took some time off. We  took about a year off, so we left at 2007, we took all of 2008  off. He moved to New York with his girlfriend, I was just goofing off, and  I really kind of fell in love with my Nokia phone.

我在那里呆了9年，他在那里呆了11年，这段时间对我们来说真的非常有价值，我们可以学习如何缩减服务器规模，什么能制造出好的产品，什么会制造出糟糕的产品，把雅虎看作是一家真正成功的公司，让他们开始创业。我们是在2007年离开的，巧合的是，我们两个差不多在同一时间离开了，就像一个月内的差距，我们休假了一段时间。我们放了一年的假，所以我们在2007年离开了，我们整个2008年都休假了。他和他的女朋友搬到纽约，我只是在胡闹，我真的爱上了我的诺基亚手机。

I had this candy  bar, I think it was 6610 Nokia phone that I jail-broke.

我有这个糖果条，我想是6610诺基亚手机，我坐牢-坏了。

I installed a net-mon  software, which showed you which mobile cell you were connected to, and all these advanced  things you could do with the phone that you couldn't do when you took it  out of the box. So at the end of 2008, I went traveling.

我安装了一个net-mon软件，它向你展示了你连接到哪个移动手机，以及所有这些你可以用手机做的高级事情，当你把手机从盒子里拿出来的时候，你做不到的。所以在2008年底，我去旅行了。

I went  to Argentina, I went to Russia, to Ukraine, to Hungary, to Israel, to a bunch  of countries.

我去了阿根廷，我去了俄罗斯，乌克兰，匈牙利，以色列，还有很多国家。

I was gone for like 2-3 months on and off, and what I  found really hard during that time was keeping in touch with my friends, especially in  Argentina.

我离开了大约2-3个月，在这段时间里，我发现真正困难的是与我的朋友保持联系，特别是在阿根廷。

I don't know if anybody here is from Argentina, or been to Argentina, like  ... There you go, so one person. What was your dialing code? Like it's so  complicated! I could never understand it. When we were in Argentina, just having people call  us, or me calling people was like ...

我不知道这里有没有人来自阿根廷，或者去过阿根廷，比如.给你，所以只有一个人。你的拨号密码是什么？好像太复杂了！我永远无法理解。当我们在阿根廷的时候，让人给我们打电话，或者我给别人打电话，就像.

I went and got a local sim  card, but I couldn't figure out how people would call me, because of these weird,  complicated dialing codes and prefixes, and I was just like, ugh! So this is how  2008 ends, and January of 2009, my birthday was coming up in February, and I  figured I'll get myself an early birthday present, I'll go buy and iPhone.

我去拿了一张本地的卡，但是我不知道人们会怎么打电话给我，因为这些奇怪的，复杂的拨号代码和前缀，我就像，呃！这就是2008年的结局，2009年1月，我的生日在二月到来，我想我会提前给自己买一份生日礼物，我会去买和买iPhone。

I went  to the Apple store, bought an iPhone, and right around the same time as the  came out.

我去了苹果商店，买了一部iPhone，就在它问世的同时。

I think there was no SDK when iPhone first came out in 2007,  but I think they released at September of 2008. So I was literally 3-4 months  after iPhone came out ... Sorry, after iOS SDK came out, I got an iPhone  and I started tinkering with it.

我认为iPhone在2007年首次发布时没有SDK，但我认为它们是在2008年9月发布的。所以在iPhone问世后的3-4个月里.对不起，iOS SDK出来后，我买了一部iPhone，我开始对它进行修补。

I was also really board, and I had a  lot of free time, so I'm like, "Okay, well let's install this weird thing called  Xcode," luckily I had a Mac. Let's install Xcode, let's figure out what can be  done, let's build some simple app, and then you kind of realize, "Holy shit! It  has full internet connectivity, and it can do full TCP/IP stack, so it basically is  a little computer that can talk to your server." So I'm like, "Okay, cool. What  can we do with it?" The first thing that we built, which I don't know  how many of you know this is the history of WhatsApp, the first thing that  we build was actually this concept of a status. So the idea was, if you  ever used, and you all might be too young for this, if you ever used  something like AOL, AIM or ICQ, or IRC, or any of these products, you have  this concept of status, like Yahoo Messenger had this "away from keyboard", or "I'm busy",  or "I'm in at a meeting". So the first thing that you would do when  you used those messengers is you would like ... The first message you would send  was, "Hey, are you there?" That was like the first message you sent to start  a conversation with somebody on ICQ, or if you private messaged somebody on IRC, because  people would be away, and so they would use a status to indicate I'm not  near a computer, or I'm AFK, or whatever. So the idea was, "Well, let's take  this concept of status and just apply it to your phone, so before people call  you, they can check your status." Maybe you're busy, maybe you're in a meeting, maybe  you're traveling, whatever. So if you don't pick up, at least people know why you  don't pick up, and that was kind of like the WhatsApp 1.0 application, and what  we built was the app that hooked into your address book, so the other thing  that kind of worked in our favor was there were address book APIs on the  mobile phone. They didn't really exist on a desktop, right? If you think about desktop,  like Windows from 2000 to 2008-ish, people never really put address books on their desktops.  People always had address books on their mobile phones, and so even if API existed,  there was nothing to query, because the address book database was empty on all these  devices. Luckily, the one thing that Apple opened was their address book APIs, which was  great for us. What we did was ... Sorry, we basically went through the address  book, and we could figure out if the contact in your address book was another  WhatsApp user, and that's basically how the status worked. We would take your phone number,  and if it was an international phone number, we would try to normalize it to  the plus format so all the phone numbers in our system would start was a  plus in the full international format. We would be able to detect if the other  person is a person on the WhatsApp network, a user of our product, and the  idea was that before you start a phone call, or before you send a message,  you would check the status of this person from WhatsApp, and they would say, "Oh,  I'm available," and you would call them. That was the WhatsApp 1.0.

我也是真正的董事会，我有很多空闲时间，所以我想，“好吧，让我们安装这个奇怪的叫做Xcode的东西，”幸运的是我有一个Mac。让我们安装Xcode，让我们知道可以做什么，让我们构建一些简单的应用程序，然后您就会意识到，“天哪！它有完全的互联网连接，它可以完成完整的TCP/IP堆栈，所以它基本上是一台可以与您的服务器对话的小型计算机。”所以我说，“好吧，好吧。我们能用它做什么？”我们构建的第一件事，我不知道你们中有多少人知道这是WhatsApp的历史，我们构建的第一件事实际上是一个状态的概念。所以他们的想法是，如果你们曾经使用过，你们可能都太年轻了，如果你们使用过AOL，AIM，ICQ，或者IRC之类的产品，或者任何这些产品，你就有这样的地位概念，就像Yahoo Messenger有这样的“远离键盘”，或者“我很忙”，或者“我在开会”。所以当你使用那些信使的时候你会做的第一件事就是你想.你要传达的第一个信息是，“嘿，你在吗？”这就像你发送的第一条信息，开始与ICQ上的某个人交谈，或者如果你在IRC上给某人发私人信息，因为人们会离开，所以他们会用状态来表示我不在电脑附近，或者我是AFK，或者其他什么。所以我们的想法是，“好吧，让我们把这个状态的概念应用到你的手机上，这样在人们打电话给你之前，他们可以检查你的状态。”也许你很忙，也许你在开会，也许你在旅行，随便吧。所以如果你不接电话，至少人们知道你为什么不接电话，这有点像WhatsApp 1.0应用程序，我们构建的是连接到你的地址簿上的应用程序，所以对我们有利的另一件事是手机上有通讯录API。它们并不存在于桌面上，对吗？如果你想到桌面，比如2000到2008年间的Windows，人们从来不会把地址簿放在桌面上。人们的手机上总是有地址簿，所以即使存在API，也没有什么可查询的，因为地址簿数据库在所有这些设备上都是空的。幸运的是，苹果打开的一件事是他们的地址簿API，这对我们来说很棒。我们所做的是.。对不起，我们基本上检查了地址簿，我们可以知道通讯录中的联系人是否是WhatsApp的另一个用户，这基本上就是状态的工作方式。我们会取你的电话号码，如果它是一个国际电话号码，我们会尝试将它标准化为加号格式，这样我们系统中的所有电话号码都会以完整的国际格式开始。我们可以检测到另一个人是否是WhatsApp网络上的人，我们的产品的用户之一，他们的想法是，在你开始打电话之前，或者在你发送信息之前，你会从WhatsApp上检查这个人的状态，他们会说，“哦，我有空，”然后你就给他们打电话。那是WhatsApp 1.0。

It failed horribly,  like, it was a disaster.

它失败得可怕，就像，这是一场灾难。

It was depressing. Nobody used it. People downloaded it, surprisingly  enough, and I think people downloaded it because there were like no apps back at  that time. There were maybe a thousand or two thousand apps in the whole App  Store, because it just went live. So we benefited from being early, but the idea  wasn't that great. People would download, and they would never use it. People just called  people like they normally would.

太令人沮丧了。没人用过。令人惊讶的是，人们下载了它，我认为人们下载它是因为当时还没有应用程序。整个应用商店里可能有一千到两千个应用程序，因为它刚刚上线。所以我们从早早中获益，但这个想法并没有那么好。人们会下载，他们永远不会使用它。人们只是像平常那样给人打电话。

It was really hard to replace a native dialer, that's  kind of what we wanted to do. We wanted to replace the native dialing application.  We struggled for a little bit. We kept adding all these weird features, in retrospect.  Back then we though they were the best thing ever, like you could set your  status to automatically change at a certain time of day.

很难替换本地方言，这是我们想要做的。我们希望取代本机拨号应用程序。我们挣扎了一会儿。回想起来，我们一直在添加这些奇怪的特性。那时我们认为它们是最好的东西，就像你可以在一天中的某个时间自动改变你的状态一样。

If you knew you were  always in a meeting from 2:00 to 4:00, you could automatically configure it to always  say that you were in a meeting from 2:00 to 4:00.

如果您知道您一直处于2：00至4：00的会议中，则可以自动将其配置为总是在2：00至4：00的会议中。

It kind of had  that functionality, and then something happened around the summer of 2009, Apple introduced Push notifications.  Back then, if you wanted the application to wake up, the only way to wake  it up was the user tapping on an application icon, and there was no way  to do anything in the background, which in retrospect was really backwards, because ...

它有这种功能，然后在2009年夏天左右发生了一些事情，苹果公司推出了推送通知。那时，如果您希望应用程序醒过来，唯一的唤醒方法就是用户点击应用程序图标，而在后台没有办法做任何事情，回想起来，因为.

I  don't know if any of you know about Nokia Symbian phones, but s60 and BlackBerry  had all this capability, even before iPhone came out, to do auto-start, to do background  multitasking, to do networking, to do all of this stuff. So iOS actually limited what  we can do, so we were struggling, and then Apple introduced Push notifications. We were  like, "Hallelujah!" We ended up hooking it up into Push notifications, I think this was  around the summer time, even before they were still in beta, because we had developer  access. We noticed that people were using the status as a way to kind of  communicate with each other. They would change the status to say, "I'm going to a  bar," and the change in status would broadcast, and go to all the other people  who used WhatsApp in their address book. So around the summer of 2009, we were  like, "Huh.

我不知道你们中是否有人知道诺基亚塞班手机，但是S60和黑莓都有这样的能力，甚至在iphone问世之前，他们就可以自动启动，做背景多任务处理，做网络，做所有这些事情。因此iOS实际上限制了我们的能力，所以我们一直在挣扎，然后苹果推出了推送通知。我们说，“哈利路亚！”我们最终把它连接到推送通知中，我认为这是在夏天的时候，甚至在它们还处于测试版之前，因为我们有了开发人员的访问权限。我们注意到人们利用这种状态作为一种相互交流的方式。他们会改变状态，说，“我要去酒吧”，状态的改变会广播，然后去找所有在通讯录上使用WhatsApp的人。所以在2009年夏天左右，我们说，“嗯。

Interesting, maybe we should build messaging." And then it all kind of clicked,  because I always used SMS, and if you remember in the old Nokia phones, the  SMS was not threaded. So you would get a message, it would show up as  a phone number, and if you get any other messages from that person, it would  show up as just another entry in your list. Then iOS came out and introduced  threaded SMS and everybody went, "Wow." So we kind of said, "Okay, well we can  do full networking, we can do TCP/IP, we can connect a phone if your phone  is a client to a server on the backend. We already had all this code  to figure out if you're a WhatsApp user or not, we could take your phone  number, parse it, figure out all the international prefixes. We even figured out Argentina at  some point, which was not an easy thing to do, but we got there. So  we got to a state where we could actually have people send messages over WhatsApp,  and if you look at our application today, you see all these features. You see  group chat, you see ability to send media, to record voice messages, to do all  this stuff. We didn't have any of it. The only thing we had was one-on-one  messaging, that's it. Just think how antiquated that is, and that's what the launch was.  Around September, I think it was September-ish ... Maybe late August, early September ... Maybe  even early October, I actually don't remember, is when we launched messaging, and it took  off.

有趣的是，也许我们应该建立消息传递。“然后所有的点击，因为我总是使用短信，如果你还记得在旧的诺基亚手机，短信不是线程。所以你会收到一条信息，它会显示为一个电话号码，如果你收到来自那个人的任何其他信息，它就会显示为你列表中的另一个条目。然后IOS推出了线程短信，每个人都说：“哇！”所以我们说，“好吧，我们可以做完全的网络，我们可以做TCP/IP，如果你的手机是客户端，我们可以连接到后端的服务器。我们已经有了所有这些代码来确定您是否是WhatsApp用户，我们可以获取您的电话号码，解析它，找出所有的国际前缀。我们甚至在某个时候发现了阿根廷，这不是一件容易的事情，但我们到达了那里。因此，我们到了一个可以让人们通过WhatsApp发送消息的状态，如果您今天查看我们的应用程序，您会看到所有这些特性。你看到了集体聊天，你看到了发送媒体，记录语音信息，做所有这些事情的能力。我们什么都没有。我们唯一拥有的就是一对一的信息，仅此而已。想想看，这是多么过时，这就是发射的原因。在九月左右，我想是九月.也许八月底九月初.。也许甚至是10月初，我真的不记得了，那是我们发布消息的时候，它起飞了。

It was intuitive to us why it took off, because SMS was so expensive  back in those days, right? And especially international SMS. So if you had two people  who were living in two different countries, how did they communicate? Well, they could send  each other SMS, it was expensive. They could us Skype, but Skype mostly worked on  a desktop, so you had to synchronize the time when both of you are in  front of a computer, and people usually are not. Some of you have computers open,  but if you get a Skype call now, you're not going to answer it, right?  There was really no good way for people to communicate in real time. So that's  why SMS was so popular, because your phone was always with you.

这是我们的直觉，为什么它起飞，因为短信是如此昂贵的回到过去，对吗？尤其是国际短信。如果你有两个人住在两个不同的国家，他们是如何沟通的呢？嗯，他们可以互相发短信，这太贵了。他们可以是Skype，但Skype主要是在桌面上工作，所以你必须同步你们两个都在电脑前的时间，而人们通常不是这样的。有些人开着电脑，但如果现在接到Skype电话，你就不会接，对吧？对人们来说，没有一种好的实时交流方式。这就是短信之所以如此流行的原因，因为你的手机总是伴随着你。

It was always  in your pocket, it was always no matter where you went you had your phone  with you. When you sent an SMS, you never said, "Hey, are you there?" You  never did that, you just sent an SMS. The only thing sometimes you could say  is, "Hey, did you get my message?" Because SMS was so unreliable, especially internationally. That  was the other problem that we could solve by building on top of TCP/IP, is  we could add reliability in our protocol. So we rolled out messaging, we made it  super reliable, we added all these visual indicators. You knew if the message actually was  successfully delivered to a server, you knew if it was successfully delivered to the device  that you were sending it to, and it just took off. When Sam talked about,  "Well, we kind of went heads down, and we didn't go to conferences, and we  didn't do a whole lot of other stuff." It's just because we were lucky. We  stumbled into something that people really, really had a need for. Just think about SMS  back in 2006-2007, right? There was no iMessage, nothing else worked on your phone. SMS  was expensive, it was horribly limiting. You could only send 160 characters at a time,  and if you sent a longer message, it would break it into multiple chunks, and  sometimes the chunk of the bottom would arrive first. So you have to read the  message at the bottom and then read the message on top after that. Media was  horribly expensive, and it was not working well across platforms.

它总是在你的口袋里，无论你去哪里，你都带着你的手机。当你发短信的时候，你从没说过：“嘿，你在吗？”你没那么做你只是发了条短信。有时候你唯一能说的就是，“嘿，你收到我的信息了吗？”因为短信太不可靠了，尤其是在国际上。这是我们可以通过构建TCP/IP来解决的另一个问题，那就是我们可以在我们的协议中增加可靠性。所以我们推出了消息，我们使它超级可靠，我们增加了所有这些视觉指示器。您知道消息是否确实成功地传递到服务器，您知道它是否成功地传递到您要发送到的设备，然后它就起飞了。当萨姆谈到，“嗯，我们有点低下头，我们没有去参加会议，我们也没有做很多其他的事情。”只是因为我们很幸运。我们无意中发现了人们真正需要的东西。回想一下2006-2007年的短信，对吧？没有iMessage，你手机上没有其他功能。短信是昂贵的，它是可怕的限制。一次只能发送160个字符，如果发送更长的消息，它会将其分解为多个块，有时底部的块会首先到达。所以，你必须在底部阅读信息，然后再阅读顶部的信息。媒体价格昂贵，跨平台运行也不太好。

If I sent a video  recorded on Nokia phone to a BlackBerry user, I probably couldn't have watched it. Or  if you sent a video recorded on BlackBerry to an iPhone it probably wouldn't work  either. So we had all these limitations with SMS that we were trying to address  in our product, and obviously the biggest problem was cost. SMS was very expensive in  Europe and in many countries outside of North America, and we just kept going. Once  we figured out that there is a need for it, we were like, "Well, we  better hire." So we hired some of our old friends from Yahoo, who left Yahoo,  some of our ex-Yahoo friends. We hired a friend of mine who I actually meant  when I was working at Stamford, when I was doing IT at Graduate School of  Business in like '96, '97-ish, back when I was in high school. So he came,  and he helped work on the BlackBerry client, and so our goal was like, "Okay,  well we've got to build all these features, but we've also got to build all  these platforms," because we started out with iPhone, but the world back then was very  different. Nokia actually was majority smart phone platform back in the days. Not in North  America, but if you looked at the rest of the world, everybody was using Nokia  smart phones, and BlackBerry, and Android I think didn't even exist, or just barely existed  at the end of 2009 and early 2010. So, we had to build for Nokia,  and we had to find people who could actually build for Nokia, Symbian and s60,  and we had to find those people in Europe because nobody in Silicon Valley even  heard of Nokia. We found two really good engineers to help us build that. Funny  story about our Nokia client, it's actually built using Python. Not a lot of people  know that actually Nokia s60 had a Python runtime. So remember when Brian, my co-founder,  he started looking at Nokia because we knew that we had to do Nokia, so  he went away for a week. He comes back a week later, he's like, "You're  not going to believe this, you can use Python to build a client." I was  like, "No way! Get out of here." He was like, "No, no, no, no, no!  Seriously! You don't understand. You can run Python on this little, tiny phone." I was  like, "Okay, let's try and do it," and that's what we did. The Basic was  a whole backend. The communications, the protocol was all in Python, and the UI was  actually in C++. We started working on building multiple platforms, and we started working on  building features. So we launched BlackBerry, we launched Nokia s60, we launched Android, all within  a few months of each other in 2010, and then we started building features. We  had to build what people asked us to build. People wanted group chat. Everybody's like,  "This is great.

如果我把诺基亚手机上录制的视频发送给黑莓用户，我可能无法观看。或者，如果你把一段用黑莓录制的视频发送到iPhone上，它也可能无法工作。因此，我们在短信中有所有这些限制，我们试图在我们的产品中解决，显然最大的问题是成本。短信在欧洲和北美以外的许多国家非常昂贵，我们一直在继续。一旦我们意识到这是有必要的，我们就会说，“好吧，我们最好雇个人。”所以我们从雅虎雇佣了一些老朋友，他们离开了雅虎，我们的一些前雅虎朋友也离开了雅虎。我们雇佣了我的一个朋友，我在斯坦福德工作的时候，当我在商业研究生院工作的时候，大概是96年，97年，那时我还在读高中。所以他来了，他帮助黑莓客户端的工作，所以我们的目标是，“好吧，我们必须构建所有这些功能，但我们也必须构建所有这些平台，”因为我们从iPhone开始，但当时的世界是非常不同的。诺基亚实际上是当时的大多数智能手机平台。不是在北美，但如果你看看世界其他地方，每个人都在使用诺基亚智能手机，黑莓和安卓，我认为根本不存在，或者只是在2009年底和2010年初几乎不存在。所以，我们必须为诺基亚建造，我们必须找到真正能为诺基亚、塞班和S60建造的人，我们必须在欧洲找到这些人，因为硅谷甚至没有人听说过诺基亚。我们找到了两位非常优秀的工程师来帮助我们建造这座建筑。关于我们诺基亚客户端的有趣故事，它实际上是用Python构建的。并不是很多人知道诺基亚S60实际上有一个Python运行时。所以，还记得我的联合创始人布赖恩，他开始关注诺基亚，因为我们知道我们必须要做诺基亚，所以他离开了一个星期。一周后他回来了，他说，“你不会相信的，你可以用Python构建一个客户端。”我说，“没门！离开这里“他说，“不，不！我是认真的你不明白。你可以在这个小小的手机上运行Python。“我说，“好吧，让我们试着去做”，这就是我们所做的。基本是一个完整的后端。通信、协议都是用Python编写的，UI实际上是用C+编写的。我们开始构建多个平台，并开始构建功能。因此，我们推出了黑莓，我们推出了诺基亚S60，我们推出了Android，在2010年的几个月内，我们开始构建功能。我们必须建造人们要求我们建造的东西。人们想要集体聊天。每个人都说，“这太棒了。

I love your product.

我喜欢你的产品。

I want to have a group conversation with  my family, or three friends, or five coworkers, or ten people in a study group."  And we're like, "Okay, well ... How do we build group chat? Let's figure it  out." We sat down and sketched the user experience, then figured out how to make  the backend system work for group chat, and then people wanted ... Obviously we very  quickly added multimedia, and I think multimedia is what really took us to the next  level. Once we added the ability to send a picture, which today is like comical.  How could not have ability to send a picture through a messaging product over your  smart phone? Back then you couldn't. There was nothing that worked really well, or was  cheap or was reliable. So we added the ability to send a picture, we added  the ability to send videos, we at some point introduced voice messages, and then things  just took off. At that point, it was just scaling the backend, and this is  where it kind of ties into what I was talking about earlier, where me and  Brian worked at Yahoo. Because we spent so much time there, and because we were  there in early days, and we saw the company scale, we had all this experience  to scale the backend, and we had our own share of outages and our service  wasn't 100% perfect, but we would make sure that we would learn from an outage,  and make sure that we would add the right monitoring in place, and we would  have enough capacity always for holidays like Christmas and New Years where the traffic spiked.  But having that experience working at Yahoo, learning how to scale the backend systems, learning  how to tweak the operating systems and kernels, and networking stack, the ethernet driver if  you had to.

我想和我的家人，或者三个朋友，五个同事，或者一个学习小组中的十个人进行一次集体交谈。“我们说，”好吧，好吧.我们如何建立团体聊天？让我们想想办法吧。“我们坐下来，勾勒出用户的体验，然后想出如何使后端系统为群聊工作，然后人们想要.很明显，我们很快就加入了多媒体，我认为多媒体才是真正把我们提升到更高水平的原因。有一次，我们增加了发送图片的能力，这一点今天很滑稽。怎么可能没有能力通过你的智能手机上的短信产品发送图片呢？那时候你做不到。没有什么是真正有效的，或者是廉价的，或者是可靠的。所以我们增加了发送图片的能力，我们增加了发送视频的能力，我们在某个时候引入了语音信息，然后事情就开始起飞了。那时，它只是在扩展后端，这就是我之前所说的，我和Brian在雅虎工作的地方。因为我们在那里花了那么多时间，因为我们在早期就在那里，而且我们看到了公司的规模，我们有所有这些经验来扩展后端，我们有自己的部分停机，我们的服务也不是100%完美，但是我们会确保我们能从一次故障中吸取教训，并确保我们会增加正确的监控。在适当的地方，我们将有足够的能力去度假，比如圣诞节和新年，那里的交通拥堵。但是在雅虎工作的经历，学习如何扩展后端系统，学习如何调整操作系统和内核，以及网络堆栈，如果有必要的话，网络栈就是以太网驱动程序。

It all kind of tied together, so our experience at Yahoo, our  experience with difficult or challenging SMS protocol that we used as consumer, kind of all  combined with this perfect timing that happened in 2009, 2010 with smart phones coming online,  and people wanted to have this ability to communicate.

这一切都是联系在一起的，所以我们在雅虎的经历，我们作为消费者使用的困难或具有挑战性的短信协议，都与2009年和2010年智能手机上线的完美时机结合在一起，人们想要有这种沟通能力。

If you think about a smart  phone, it's ultimately ... Like the messaging is a killer app for a smart phone.  So we just basically stumbled into the killer app, because there is nothing else you  do more with a smart phone than communicate. Most of it is probably talking to  your friends and family, and your loved ones, either over iMessage or WhatsApp, or Skype,  or anything else. Yes, the guy from Argentina.

如果你想到一部智能手机，最终.就像短信是智能手机的杀手应用一样。所以我们只是无意中进入了杀手级的应用程序，因为在智能手机上，没有比交流更多的事情了。其中大部分可能是通过iMessage、WhatsApp、Skype或其他方式与你的朋友、家人和你的亲人交谈。是的，阿根廷人。

Speaker 1: Could you do it again?
Sam: Huh?
Speaker 1: Could you make another app again that takes off?
Sam: A messaging app, or just an app?
Speaker 1: Just any app.

演讲者1：你能再做一次吗？山姆：嗯？扬声器1：你能再做一个能起飞的应用吗？山姆：短信应用，还是仅仅是一个应用？扬声器1：任何应用程序。

Jan Koum: I couldn't.

简·库姆：我不能。

I'm sure you can.

我相信你可以。

I already did it once, the chances of being  successful again are like zero. The odds are in your side, so you should go  and do something. That's why we're able to actually spend all of our time heads  down, building our product, because we had this amazing product market fit. We had this  amazing product that people wanted. They were like, "Gimme, gimme, gimme!" When we were rolling  out Nokia s40, which was just step below a Nokia s60, which was kind of  like a picture phone, people were emailing us, asking for like, "When is it going  to be done? When is it going to be done? When is it going to  be done?!" So there was a huge pent up demand for any platform before we  would launch it, and that's why we didn't have a need to go to the  conferences and do a lot of PR, or do anything like that, because we had  people who needed our product, and we had millions of people who were waiting for  us to build a new feature or a new platform, and that's why we were  able to just go heads down and build the product. That was kind of the  background that I wanted to give you on how we got started. We can do  a Q&A for the next 15-20 minutes, and ... Yeah.

我已经做过一次了，再次成功的机会几乎为零。机会在你身边，所以你应该去做点什么。这就是为什么我们能够把我们所有的时间都花在头上，建造我们的产品，因为我们拥有这个惊人的产品市场。我们有一个人们想要的惊人的产品。他们说，“给我，给我！”当我们推出诺基亚S40时，它就在诺基亚S60的下方，就像一部图片手机，人们给我们发电子邮件，问我们“什么时候才能完成？”因此，在我们推出任何平台之前，对它的需求都是巨大的，这就是为什么我们没有必要去参加会议，做很多公关工作，或者做类似的事情，因为我们有需要我们的产品的人，还有数以百万计的人在等着我们建立一个新的功能或者一个新的功能。新的平台，这就是为什么我们能够直接着手构建产品的原因。这就是我想给你们的背景，我们是如何开始的。我们可以在接下来的15到20分钟内做个问答，然后.嗯

Speaker 2: The specific thing I wanted to hear most about is how you dealt with the  launch of iMessage, and Facebook Messenger, and all of these other messaging platforms. WhatsApp was  clearly first, and then the world got scary quickly. How did you think about that?  What was it like inside of the company?
Jan Koum: So, how did we think about iMessenger and all these other platforms? Well, with iMessage  we ... When did they launch? I think 2011-ish? Something like that.

演讲者2：我最想听到的是你是如何处理iMessage，Facebook Messenger，以及其他所有这些消息平台的发布的。WhatsApp显然是第一位的，然后这个世界很快就变得可怕起来。你是怎么想的？公司内部是什么样的？简·库姆：那么，我们是如何看待iMessenger和所有其他平台的呢？有了iMessage我们.。他们什么时候发射的？我想2011年吧？差不多是这样的。

I think 2011,  at the developer conference. So the world in Silicon Valley is very different from the  world outside.

我想2011年，在开发者大会上。所以硅谷的世界和外面的世界很不一样。

In Silicon Valley, if you look around, 90% of people of an iPhone.  Not only do they have an iPhone, they have the latest, greatest iPhone. Outside of  Silicon Valley, it's like 80-90% Android. So for us, having an iMessage launch was just  like a small blip on our radar.

在硅谷，如果你环顾四周，90%的iPhone用户。他们不仅有iPhone，还有最新最棒的iPhone。在硅谷之外，它大约有80%-90%的Android。所以对我们来说，iMessage的发射就像我们雷达上的一个小亮点。

Speaker 2: What about Facebook Messenger?
Jan Koum: So I think Facebook for a very long time didn't have a good messaging .  I remember they bought this company called Beluga, which ...

演讲者2：Facebook信使呢？简·库姆：所以我认为Facebook很长一段时间没有很好的信息传递。我记得他们买了一家叫Beluga的公司。

I think it was Beluga.  That was group messaging, so they were kind of focused on group messaging at first,  and then they shut it down and turned it into Facebook Messenger, but Facebook Messenger  was part of the Facebook app.

我想是贝卢加干的。这是一种群发消息，所以他们一开始就专注于群发消息，然后他们关闭了它，把它变成了Facebook Messenger，但Facebook Messenger是Facebook应用程序的一部分。

It wasn't really a dedicated app back in the  day, but ultimately if you look at the Facebook Messenger, the graph that the Facebook  Messenger is using is very different from the graph on your phone.

这并不是一个真正的专用应用程序，但最终如果你看一下Facebook Messenger，Facebook Messenger正在使用的图表与你手机上的图表有很大的不同。

If you think  about people you add to your address book, and people who you add on Facebook,  there's going to be some overlap, but for the most part it's going to be  different. People who I add on Facebook are probably not people who I'm going to  message with a lot, and people who I put in my address book are people  who are probably a different graph in terms of how important they are to me,  and if I add you into my ... Basically if I exchange a number with  somebody, it means I give them the ability to WhatsApp me, SMS me, or call  me. There are probably a lot of people who I'm friends with on Facebook who,  if they called me, I would probably first go like, "Who is this? Oh yeah!  We met each other once and I added them." I'm probably not necessarily a typical  example.

如果你想到你在地址簿上添加的人，以及你在Facebook上添加的人，就会有一些重叠之处，但在大多数情况下，情况会有所不同。我在facebook上添加的人可能不是我要用大量信息留言的人，而我在我的地址簿中输入的人，在他们对我有多重要的问题上可能是一个不同的图表，如果我把你加进我的.基本上，如果我和某个人交换了一个号码，那就意味着我给了他们这个能力，可以给我应用软件，给我发短信，或者给我打电话。在Facebook上，可能有很多我是朋友的人，如果他们打电话给我，我可能会先说：“这是谁？哦，是的！我们见过一次面，我加了他们。”我可能不一定是个典型的例子。

I'm sure there are people who have different graphs on different networks.

我相信有些人在不同的网络上有不同的图表。

I'm sure  there are people who use WhatsApp only for work, and they only have their coworkers  on the WhatsApp, or in their address book, and I'm sure that there are people  who only have a certain set of their contacts in one or the other. But  I think overall, this idea of like, "Well, if I add you to my phone,  I give you permission to interrupt my life," is what makes our network a little  different, because people have these connections that are stronger with people who they have on  each other's address book. With Facebook, I have people I went to high school with,  I have people who I went to nursery with, and it's great that I can  keep in touch with them on Facebook, but I wouldn't want them to call me  randomly, out of the blue at 7:00pm.

我相信有些人只在工作中使用WhatsApp，他们只有同事在WhatsApp上，或者在他们的通讯录里，而且我确信有些人在其中一种或另一种中只有一组特定的联系人。但我认为，总的来说，“如果我把你加到我的手机里，我允许你打断我的生活，”这让我们的网络有点不同，因为人们有更强的联系，与他们在对方的通讯录上的人。在Facebook上，我有和我一起上高中的人，也有和我一起去托儿所的人，很高兴我能在Facebook上和他们保持联系，但我不想让他们在晚上7点突然间随便给我打电话。

It would be just awkward, because I haven't  talked to them for years. So the graphs are different in that sense. So we  always had ... Kind of going back and generalizing it, we always had competition. From  like day one. There was actually a point in time where there was a new  messaging app popping up like every month, and every month there was an article in  TechCrunch how this awesome new messaging app is going to take down all other messaging  apps, and I don't know if they paid TechCrunch to write it or what, and  then we just read this, and we'll go like, "They have no users! How can  you write that story in TechCrunch?!" It just makes no sense, and obviously we didn't  want to say anything, because we don't want to draw attention to ourselves. We actually  on purpose tried to stay under the radar, but it was just kind of funny  to see this from the sidelines, all this kind of dog and pony show that  happened with all these apps.

这会很尴尬，因为我已经好多年没和他们说话了。所以图在这个意义上是不同的。所以我们总是.。回到过去，把它概括起来，我们总是有竞争的。从第一天开始。每个月都会有一款新的即时通讯应用出现，每个月都会有一篇文章在TechCrunch上发表-这个令人敬畏的新消息应用程序将把所有其他的消息应用程序都删除-我不知道他们是否付钱给TechCrunch来编写它，然后我们就读了这篇文章，我们会说：“他们没有用户！你怎么能用TechCrunch写这个故事呢？“这是毫无意义的，显然我们什么也不想说，因为我们不想让别人注意到我们自己。我们实际上是故意想不被人注意的，但是在场边看到这一切，所有这些应用程序都发生了这样的狗和小马表演，这是一件很有趣的事情。

I mean, there was PingMe, there was MessageMe, there was  GroupMe, there was Kik. They were like, "Hello!" There were like ten different messaging apps  at some point, which kept getting all this publicity, and we were like, "Good for  you. Have the publicity you want, we'll just stand under the radar, and not have  any attention drawn to us." So we always had competition, be it big guys like  iMessage or Facebook Messenger, be it little guys like Kik. We always had competition, we  always ... Even today we still have apps like Telegram out there, and LINE or  Kakao, but what we said, that our destiny is really in our hands. We can't  worry too much about competition, we have to worry about our product, and our users,  and if we spend a lot of time thinking about competition or looking at competition,  we're going to fail. Yeah.

我是说，有平美，有MessageMe，有GroupMe，有Kik。他们说，“你好！”在某种程度上，有十个不同的消息应用程序，这些应用不断地吸引着我们的注意，我们说，“真好。有你想要的宣传，我们就会躲在人们的注意之下，而不会引起我们的注意。”所以我们一直都有竞争，不管是像iMessage这样的大人物，还是Facebook Messenger，不管是像Kik这样的小人物。我们总是有竞争，我们总是.即使在今天，我们仍然有像Telegram、Line或Kakao这样的应用程序，但是我们说的是，我们的命运真的掌握在我们的手中。我们不能太担心竞争，我们必须担心我们的产品，我们的用户，如果我们花费大量的时间去思考竞争或关注竞争，我们就会失败。嗯

Speaker 3: So trying to build on what you just talked about this, so with your graph  ...

演讲者3：所以试着在你刚才所说的基础上，用你的图表.

I mean, I feel like this whole social graph, it is actually now changing?  At least among me and my friends.

我的意思是，我觉得整个社会图表，它实际上正在改变？至少在我和我的朋友中间。

I think I don't call people so much,  I don't really send them SMS.

我想我不会经常给人们打电话，我也不会给他们发短信。

I will probably add people mostly on this social  media, like online, Facebook, or I could on chat apps like WhatsApp, but I feel  like this whole social graph, it is changing slowly, because people call less and people  send SMS less. People like to do it more on these social media platforms. Do  you have a view on that? And do you think there's any opportunity beyond that?  Or do you think this has been true?
Jan Koum: Yeah, I think it's true. So the question was, the world is changing. People call  less, and now people add. The social networks all kind of merge into one now.  Yeah, you're right.

我可能会在这个社交媒体上添加很多人，比如在线，Facebook，或者我可以在WhatsApp这样的聊天应用上添加，但我觉得整个社交图变化很慢，因为人们打电话少了，发短信少了。人们喜欢在这些社交媒体平台上做更多的事情。你对此有什么看法吗？你觉得还有其他的机会吗？还是你认为这是真的？简·库姆：是的，我认为这是真的。所以问题是，世界正在发生变化。人们少打电话，现在又增加了。现在所有的社交网络都融合在一起了。是啊，你说得对。

I think people call less these days, and people mostly message each  other.

我认为现在人们打电话的次数减少了，而且人们大多互相传递信息。

I don't really know if we would do anything differently today, or even back  then.

我真的不知道我们今天会不会做什么不同的事情，甚至是在那个时候。

I think for us, the focus has always been on, "Well, we want to  provide a utility, we want to provide an application that is purely only about communication."  So if you look at some other apps like WeChat, or LINE, or Kakao, they  do a lot of different things, right? You can order taxis through WeChat, and you  can follow people online. Like LINE has a whole feed concept, and we always wanted  to build something that is really, really efficient and utilitarian, and also fast and reliable.  I mean, not a lot of people can have the latest and greatest smart phone.  A lot of people have Android phones that are low end. A lot of people  have or used to have BlackBerry phones that didn't have a lot of horsepower, and  a lot of memory, and a lot of CPU. For us it was always about  reliability and efficiency of the app, and not trying to do all these different things  that a lot of different social networks and apps do.

我认为，对我们来说，重点一直是，“好吧，我们想提供一个实用程序，我们想提供一个纯粹是关于通信的应用程序。”所以，如果你看看其他一些应用，比如微信，线，或者Kakao，它们会做很多不同的事情，对吗？你可以通过微信订购出租车，也可以在网上跟踪人们。就像line有一个完整的提要概念，我们一直想要建立一个非常、非常高效和实用的东西，同时也是快速可靠的。我是说，没有多少人能拥有最新最棒的智能手机。很多人都有低端的Android手机。很多人都有黑莓手机，没有太多的马力，内存和CPU也不多。对我们来说，它总是关于应用的可靠性和效率，而不是试图做所有这些不同的事情，许多不同的社交网络和应用程序所做的。

Sam: Yeah.

山姆：是啊。

Speaker 4: So how do think about Messenger right now? Because now Messenger integrated a lot of  features that WhatsApp had.

演讲者4：那么现在如何看待信使呢？因为现在Messenger集成了WhatsApp拥有的许多功能。

I am starting to use Messenger a lot more, and that  I think takes away from the air time of WhatsApp. Do you have a ton  of competition?
Jan Koum: No, I think in general there is still a lot of room for both apps  to grow.

我开始更多地使用Messenger了，我认为这会减少WhatsApp的播放时间。你有很多竞争对手吗？简·库姆：不，我认为总的来说，这两款应用都有很大的发展空间。

I think Messenger is really strong in countries like North America, like the  United States for example. So I think we compliment each other geographically.

我认为信使号在北美这样的国家非常强大，比如美国。所以我想我们在地理上互相恭维。

I think if  you look at countries like India, or Israel, or Hong Kong, or Germany, or Spain,  WhatsApp has a really strong foothold in those countries, and I think if you look  at something like Australia or North America, you're probably going to see Messenger do really  well. So a lot of it is also not necessarily split by a graph, but  also by a country you're in. Yeah?
Speaker 5: I appreciate the humility that you couldn't do it again with another app, but I'm  sure people ask you all the time for help or advice. How do you determine  if you hear an idea or look at an application that can do really well?  How do you think you know?
Jan Koum: It's very simple. The question is how od you determine if an app has a  potential or is a good idea.

我认为，如果你看看印度、以色列、香港、德国或西班牙这样的国家，WhatsApp在这些国家有很强的立足点，我认为如果你看看澳大利亚或北美，你可能会看到Messenger做得很好。所以很多东西也不一定是被图表分割的，而是被你所在的国家分割出来的。嗯演讲者5：我很感激你不能再用另一款应用程序做这件事的谦卑，但我相信人们总是向你寻求帮助或建议。您如何确定您是否听到了一个想法，或看了一个应用程序，可以做得很好？你怎么知道的？简·库姆：很简单。问题是你如何判断一个应用程序是有潜力的，还是一个好主意。

It has to solve a really basic problem, and  it has to do it in a simple and efficient way.

它必须解决一个真正的基本问题，它必须以一种简单和有效的方式。

I mean, going back  to what we built, we in some ways solved a problem, right? People had a  problem communicating when they were not in the same room, when they were in different  cities, or different countries, or in different time zones. So it's not that it wasn't  impossible, it's just it was hard and it was expensive, and we made it easier  and cheaper, and when you offer something to people that is easier and cheeper, people  of course will use it. So I think the number one thing to look at  for me, when I look at a product, does it solve a need? And does  it solve a need on a global scale.

我是说，回到我们建造的地方，我们在某种程度上解决了一个问题，对吗？当人们不在同一个房间，在不同的城市，不同的国家，或者在不同的时区时，他们的沟通就会有问题。这并不是说它不是不可能的，只是它很难，而且很昂贵，而且我们让它变得越来越容易，当你给人们提供更容易、更便宜的东西时，人们当然会使用它。所以我认为，对我来说最重要的是，当我看一个产品的时候，它能解决一个需求吗？它能解决全球范围的需求吗？

If you solve a need for people  on Stamford campus, that's great, but can it scale to a billion or two billion  people.

如果你解决了斯坦福德校园对人的需求，那就太好了，但它能扩大到十亿到二十亿人吗？

If you solve a need for people only in Silicon Valley by providing them  chargers for their Teslas, great. How many people have Teslas in the world? It's got  to be a global ... Actually a lot of people have a Tesla, I don't  know, but it's got to be a global solution that applies to everybody in every  country potentially, right? That was kind of-
Speaker 5: That's something I see so many start-ups sort of get wrong as you said, in  Silicon Valley. Everyone's got the iPhone 7S or whatever we're on now. How did you  build that into the culture of the company? To think about your users all around  the world?
Jan Koum: I don't know. We got lucky with the people we hired. That was the other  thing that I didn't mention that I should've mentioned. We ended up with a really  incredible team that we mostly hired out of our personal network from ex-Yahoo, and from  friends of friends.

如果你只需要为硅谷的人提供他们的特斯拉充电器，那就太好了。世界上有多少人有特斯拉？一定是全球性的.。事实上，很多人都有特斯拉，我不知道，但这必须是一个可能适用于每个国家每个人的全球性解决方案，对吧？就像你说的那样，在硅谷，我看到很多初创公司都搞错了。每个人都有iPhone 7s或者我们现在正在使用的任何东西。你是如何把它融入公司文化的？想想你在世界各地的用户？简·库姆：我不知道。我们很幸运和我们雇的人在一起。那是我不该提的另一件事。最后，我们有了一个非常棒的团队，我们主要是从我们的个人网络中从前雅虎(Yahoo)和朋友的朋友那里雇来的。

I think ourselves had a really good understanding.

我想我们自己已经有了很好的理解。

I mean, me myself  being an immigrant, and growing up in another country, and going to all these other  countries, I understood that there was more to a smart phones than just iPhone. That  was the thing that everybody talked about and wrote about in 2008 and 2009. So  for me, especially as somebody who really liked Nokia phones before Nokia went out of  business, I was like, "We got to build for Nokia, because they're great phones, and  there's like a billion Nokia smart phones out there." So I think just me and  my girlfriend are having that perspective, probably distilled through the company, and people understood that,  "Hey, you know you don't want to just build for iPhones. You don't want to  just build for the latest and greatest. You have all these millions of phones out  there, billions of phones out there that you've got to build for because you want  those users to be using your product, and they also were asking us to do  that." Yeah.

我的意思是，我自己是一个移民，在另一个国家长大，去所有这些国家，我明白智能手机不仅仅是iPhone。这是2008年和2009年每个人都在谈论和写的事情。所以对我来说，尤其是在诺基亚倒闭之前我真的很喜欢诺基亚手机，我说：“我们必须为诺基亚建造，因为它们是很棒的手机，还有大约10亿诺基亚智能手机。”所以我认为只有我和我的女朋友有着这样的观点，很可能是公司的一部分，人们明白，“嘿，你知道你不想只为iPhone而设计。”你不想只为最新和最伟大的东西而建。你有数百万部手机，你必须为之打造数十亿部手机，因为你想让用户使用你的产品，他们也要求我们这样做。“嗯

Speaker 5: Can you talk about the business, as far as incorporation, equity and raising money?
Jan Koum: The business side, my favorite topic. Sure. So we incorporated on my birthday, on February  24th of 2009, and the reason I ... The thinking that was going ... So  let me back up. We were trying to submit an app into the Apple Store,  and I didn't want to do it under my own name. Like, I didn't want  the app to say Jan Koum, because I figured who would want to install an  app made some guy? So I figured would be official! We should have a company!  I'm like, "Okay, so go to Google. How do you start a company, right?" It's  just like, step 1! So I got friend of mine, he was an insurance broker.  He had his own company and he was like three blocks away from me in  Santa Clara, where I lived.

演讲者5：你能谈谈公司、股本和集资等业务吗？简·库姆：商业方面，我最喜欢的话题。好的所以在我生日那天，2009年2月24日，我们合并了，我.当时的想法.。所以让我退后。我们试图把一个应用程序提交到苹果商店，而我不想用我自己的名字去做。比如，我不想让这个应用说简·库姆，因为我想谁会想要安装一个由某个人制作的应用程序呢？所以我想应该是正式的！我们应该有个公司！我说，“好吧，那就去谷歌吧。你是怎么创办一家公司的，对吗？”就像，第一步！所以我有了朋友，他是个保险经纪人。他有自己的公司，离我三个街区远，就在我住的圣克拉拉。

I went to his office, because I used to buy  insurance for my car and my house from him, and so I was like, "Dude,  how did you incorporate?" He was like, "Oh, it's easy. You take these articles of  incorporation." It's like one page with five things written in it, and you go to  San Francisco to the State Building, the Secretary of State or whatever, and he gives  them $100 and they stamp it and you're done! I'm like, "No way! It can't  be that easy." He's like, "Yeah, it's that easy." I'm like, "All right." So, we  had to submit an app, and they wanted us to show ... Apple Store wanted  us to actually send them a copy of the incorporation articles.

我去了他的办公室，因为我过去经常从他那里为我的车和房子买保险，所以我就想，“伙计，你是怎么融入的？”他说，“哦，这很简单。你拿着这些公司条款。”就像一页纸上写着五样东西，然后你去旧金山的国家大厦，国务卿或者其他什么，他给他们100美元，他们盖上邮票，你就完蛋了！我说，“没门！不会那么容易的。”他说，“是啊，就这么简单。”我说“好吧”所以，我们必须提交一个应用程序，他们想让我们展示.苹果商店想让我们寄给他们一份公司章程的副本。

It was like, "Okay,  easy." I have nothing to do that day, I'm going to drive to San Francisco,  get lunch, got to this office, get a stamp, get a letter, great. Send it  to Apple, they look at the letter, they're like, "Yep, you're legit. You're a company,  you can no submit under the name WhatsApp." I'm like, "Cool." Submitted an app under  the name WhatsApp. So that was how we incorporated.

就像，“好吧，放松。”那天我没什么事可做，我要开车去旧金山，吃午饭，去这间办公室，买张邮票，买封信，太好了。把它寄给苹果，他们看了看信，他们说：“是的，你是合法的。你是一家公司，你不能以WhatsApp的名字提交。”我就像，“酷”提交了一个名为WhatsApp的应用程序。所以我们就是这样合并的。

In terms of ...

就.。

It's easier  than it sounds, back then it was like a struggle for me, because I'd never  done it. How did we think about money, or the whole funding thing? So we  left Yahoo with some savings, because Yahoo did really well in the late '90s, early  2000s, and so we had stock, we had options, we had our issues. So I  was actually able to not only take year off, obviously not do anything extravagant, but  live off my savings for a year, and then I had enough money to where  ... While I was still tinkering around with an app, and we didn't have exuberant  costs ...

这比听起来容易得多，那时候对我来说就像是一场斗争，因为我从来没有做过。我们是怎么看待钱的，还是整个资金问题？所以我们给雅虎留了点钱，因为雅虎在90年代末，21世纪初做得很好，所以我们有股票，我们有期权，我们有我们的问题。所以我不仅可以休几年假，显然不做任何奢侈的事情，而且用我的积蓄生活了一年，然后我有了足够的钱去…。当我还在摆弄一个应用程序的时候，我们没有太多的成本.

I actually remember when we started out, I was using my buddy's server,  this guy Chuck who also used to work at Yahoo. He used to run Yahoo  Sports, and so I used to sit next to the Yahoo Sports team, so we  became friends.

我还记得我们刚开始的时候，我在我朋友的服务器上，也是在雅虎工作的查克。他曾经管理雅虎体育，所以我曾经坐在雅虎运动队的旁边，所以我们成了朋友。

I was like, "Hey Chuck, can I use your server? I don't want  to pay $20 a month for a server." He was like, "Yeah, sure." So saving  $20 month on the server was a big deal for me, and so we would  run originally on his server, and I remember at some point as we launched messaging,  and saw all this growth, he was like, "Dude, you got to get your own  servers." And I'm like, "No, no, I'm fine.

我说：“嘿，恰克，我能用一下你的服务器吗？我不想一个月花20美元买一台服务器。”他说，“是的，当然。”所以在服务器上节省20个月对我来说是个大问题，所以我们会在他的服务器上运行，我记得在某个时候，当我们发布消息时，看到了所有的增长，他说，“伙计，你得有自己的服务器。”我说，“不，我很好。

I don't want to pay for my  own servers." He's like, "No, no, no. You got to get your own servers. You're  taking up all this CPU and bandwidth." I'm like, "No, no, no.

我不想为我自己的服务器付钱。“他说，”不，不。你得有自己的服务器。你占用了所有的CPU和带宽。“我说，”不，不。

I'm fine, I'm  fine." So eventually, he kicked me off his server, which was great, because we switched  from Linux to FreeBSD, which a lot of them we had experience with at Yahoo.  So we were able to actually, for a long time live off our savings, and  since we had all this experience on how to run the company efficiently when it  comes to servers, and backend, and bandwidth, and everything. There was not a lot of  expense. The expense started when we had to go hire people, and the idea was  that, "Okay, well we're going to have to pay for more servers. We're going to  have to pay for bandwidth. We're going to have to pay for a , because  the sign up on WhatsApp, you have to verify your phone number." And we did  a small angel round ...

我很好，我很好。“所以最终，他把我踢出了他的服务器，这是很棒的，因为我们从Linux转向FreeBSD，其中很多我们在雅虎都有经验。事实上，我们能够在很长一段时间里靠储蓄维持生活，因为我们有很多关于如何高效运营公司的经验，涉及到服务器、后端、带宽等等。费用不多。当我们不得不去雇佣员工时，费用就开始了，我们的想法是，“好吧，我们得为更多的服务器买单。”我们得为带宽付费。我们要支付一个，因为注册WhatsApp，你必须核实你的电话号码。“我们做了一个小天使轮.

I can't really remember.

我不记得了。

I think it was end of  2009, we did a small angel round, and then we basically kept our company without  losing too much money, because in early days, iPhone app was actually paid. People had  to pay $1 to download an iPhone app while everything else was free, like Android,  and BlackBerry and Nokia. So we had people paying for iPhone app, and that gave  us the ability to pay for the bill, for electricity, for bandwidth bills, for server  bills and all that stuff.

我认为那是在2009年底，我们做了一个小天使圈，然后我们基本上保持我们的公司没有损失太多的钱，因为在早期，iPhone应用程序实际上是付费的。人们不得不花1美元下载iPhone应用程序，而其他一切都是免费的，比如Android、黑莓和诺基亚。因此，我们让人们为iPhone应用付费，这使我们有能力支付账单、电费、带宽账单、服务器账单等诸如此类的费用。

I think probably around 2011, 2010-2011, people started knocking on  our door. Like, we didn't even out to look for money, which is a great  situation to be in, because if you're going to go and raise, and you need  money, you're probably not going to get the terms you want. Which for us, kind  of worked in our favor, because all of these started coming to us, and they're  like, "You guys are doing great, we want to partner with you. We want to  give you money." And we're like, "Eh, we don't really need it," which makes them  want to invest even more. So we kind of did this dance where we're like,  "No, no. We don't really want your money. Come back in a few months." Eventually,  after all of these conversations, me and Brian sat down and we're like, "Okay, well  we're just wasting their time and our time. Should we just take funding, or should  we not?" And we decided that we should, because it's better to have money in  your bank account for your business than not, and that's the words of wisdom that  I got from Jeff , who you know, because Jeff was like: If you can  have money in your bank account, you should have money in your bank account, because  you never know if you need to buy a building, or if you need to  buy some office space, because you started growing too quickly, and you don't want to  negotiate and raise money when it's too late. You want to do it when you  don't need money. So listening to words of wisdom of Jeff , we were like,  "Okay, let's get some funding, and we partnered with Sequoia, and we got money from  Sequoia. Any other questions? Yeah.

我想大概在2011年，2010-2011年，人们开始敲我们的门。就像，我们甚至没有去寻找钱，这是一个很好的情况，因为如果你要去筹集，你需要钱，你可能得不到你想要的条件。对我们来说，这是对我们有利的，因为所有这些都开始向我们走来，他们说，“你们做得很好，我们想和你们合作。我们想给你们钱。”我们说，“呃，我们真的不需要它”，这让他们更想投资。所以我们跳了一支舞，说：“不，我们不想要你的钱，几个月后再来。”最后，在所有这些谈话之后，我和布莱恩坐下来，我们说，“好吧，我们只是在浪费他们的时间和时间。我们应该接受资助，还是不接受？”我们决定我们应该这样做，因为在你的银行账户里有钱做生意总比没有好，这是我从杰夫那里学到的智慧之言，你认识杰夫，因为杰夫说：如果你能在你的银行账户里有钱，你就应该在你的银行账户里有钱，因为你永远不知道你是否需要购买。一栋大楼，或者如果你需要买一些办公空间，因为你开始增长太快，你不想谈判和筹集资金，当一切都太晚了。当你不需要钱的时候你就想这么做。听了杰夫的智慧之言，我们说，“好吧，我们去找点资金，我们和红杉合作，我们从红杉那里得到了钱。还有其他问题吗？是的。”

Speaker 5: Can you sort of walk us through your internal psychology and confidence over the trajectory  of the company? Like at the beginning, did you identify that the market timing was  pretty spot on? Or were you just sort of following what your users were saying  to you?
Jan Koum: I think until we did messaging, when we were doing that link your status feature,  obviously it was rough, because we had no users, and nobody uses our products. So  you're sitting there, in your room, building a product and thinking like, "Well, nobody wants  it. Why am I doing this? What is the meaning of life?" And all of  that stuff, right? It's tough, right? When you're building a product that people don't really  want, you feel rejected. You feel like, "Why aren't you using it? It's great! I  put all my energy in it!" So, once we added messaging, it was 180 degrees  difference. All of sudden everybody wants our product, everybody thinks it's the coolest thing ever.  We get all these letters into our own inboxes, all these emails from people saying  how great your product is. "I'm able to keep in touch with my fiance.

演讲者5：你能让我们了解一下你对公司发展的内在心理和信心吗？就像在开始的时候，你是否发现市场时机是非常合适的？还是你只是在跟踪你的用户对你说的话呢？Jan Koum：我认为在我们做消息传递之前，当我们做链接您的状态特性时，它显然很粗糙，因为我们没有用户，也没有人使用我们的产品。所以你坐在那里，在你的房间里，建造一个产品，然后想，“好吧，没人想要它。我为什么要这样做？生命的意义是什么？”还有那些东西对吧？很难，对吧？当你制造一个人们并不真正想要的产品时，你会觉得自己被拒绝了。你觉得，“你为什么不使用它？太棒了！我把所有的精力都放在里面了！”所以，一旦我们添加了消息，就会有180度的差异。突然间，每个人都想要我们的产品，每个人都认为这是有史以来最酷的东西。我们把所有这些信件都放进我们自己的收件箱里，所有这些电子邮件都来自人们说你的产品有多棒。“我能和我的未婚夫保持联系。

I  got married because of your product." "Your product helped me save lives because the hikers  were lost, and the hikers were able to use WhatsApp share location to send ..."  It's just night and day, right? When people want your product, and they love your  product, the psychology inside a company is just different. People would come into work, and  they would be like, "We're building the best thing ever. People love the product, this  is great." So we didn't really have to do a lot of selling, even to  the candidates. People who came in to interview with us basically fell into two camps.  People who live in the Silicon Valley bubble, and never heard of WhatsApp, and they  would be like, "Why would I want to work for WhatsApp?" And people who fell  into like, ["Wow 00:38:29], there is a whole world out there," bubble, and they were  like, "You guys have millions of users. Like my cousin in Spain, or my friend  in Germany was telling me about your product, and everybody uses it!" Or people would  say, "I went to India, or I went to the Middle East and everybody uses  your product! It's amazing! How come nobody heard about you?" And we're like, "Well, that's  the purpose." So basically, we had these two types of people we would interview, and  obviously the people who had a Silicon Valley bubble didn't even want to come work  for us, which is not the end of the world, because there were plenty of  people who understood there was a whole big world out there, and they were happy  to build a product for hundreds of millions of users all over the world. Yeah.

我结婚是因为你的产品。“你的产品帮助我拯救生命，因为远足者失去了生命，徒步旅行者们能够利用WhatsApp共享的位置发送…”这只是日夜的事，对吗？当人们想要你的产品，而且他们喜欢你的产品时，公司内部的心理就是不同的。人们开始工作，他们会说，“我们正在建造有史以来最好的东西。”人们喜欢这个产品，这太棒了。“所以我们不需要做太多的推销，甚至是对候选人的推销。来采访我们的人基本上分为两个阵营。生活在硅谷泡沫中的人，从来没有听说过WhatsApp，他们会说，“为什么我想为WhatsApp工作？”而那些陷入这样的情况的人，[“哇哦00：38：29]，外面有一个完整的世界，”泡泡，他们说，“你们有数以百万计的用户。”就像我在西班牙的表弟，或者我在德国的朋友告诉我你的产品，每个人都用它！“或者人们会说，”我去了印度，或者我去了中东，每个人都用你的产品！太神奇了！怎么没人听说你呢？“我们说，“好吧，这就是目的。”基本上，我们会采访这两种类型的人，很明显，那些有硅谷泡沫的人甚至不想为我们工作，这并不是世界的末日，因为有很多人知道外面有一个巨大的世界，他们很乐意为世界各地的数亿用户制作一款产品。嗯

Sam: .

山姆：。

Speaker 8: How was the fundraising experience, and you partner with Sequoia?
Jan Koum: Why did we partner with Sequoia? We had a few companies give us term sheets.  One of them even gave us a blank term sheet. They're like, "Fill out the  number you want." And we were like, "Well, if they're that irresponsible with other people's  money, maybe we shouldn't be partnering with them." Sequoia's just an amazing break, right? For  me, living in Silicon Valley since 1992, and reading articles and seeing news about all  these companies that went public like Netscape, and Cisco, and Google, and knowing that a  lot of them were backed by Sequoia just made it not a very difficult decision  to pick Sequoia. We also really people who worked there. A lot of it is  just personal chemistry. A lot of it is the seed company understanding how much to  be hands on or not. Like, Sequoia was actually really great about ... They knew  the numbers and knew we were growing. They didn't meddle, right? They didn't need to  come in and say, "You guys are doing this wrong, or doing that wrong." There  was no need for that, and I think we had that understanding upfront, where they  kind of made us a promise. They were like, "We're here to help you financially.  We're not here to help you with management, we're not here to help you write  code, we're not here to help you build features. We're here just to help you  grow and to help your financial, and if you need any help outside of that,  come knock on our door and we'll try to help." And they were really helpful  with stuff when we asked, like recruiting or anything like that. They would sometimes meet  with prospective candidates and tell them why they should join WhatsApp. So Sequoia was really  great.

主持人8：筹款的经历如何，你和红杉合作过吗？简·库姆：为什么我们要和红杉合作？我们有几家公司给了我们学期单。其中一个甚至给了我们一张空白的学期表。他们说，“填好你想要的号码。”我们说，“如果他们对别人的钱那么不负责任，也许我们不应该和他们合作。”红杉只是一个惊人的休息，对吧？对我来说，从1992年起就住在硅谷，阅读文章，看到所有上市公司的消息，比如网景公司、思科公司和谷歌公司，知道其中很多公司都得到了红杉的支持，所以选择红杉并不是一个非常困难的决定。我们也是在那里工作的人。很多都只是个人的化学反应。很大程度上是因为种子公司知道到底需要多少钱。红杉真的很棒.。他们知道数字，也知道我们在增长。他们没有干涉，对吧？他们不需要进来说，“你们做错了，或者做错了。”没有这个必要，我想我们已经有了预先的理解，他们给了我们一个承诺。他们说：“我们来这里是为了帮助你们的经济。我们不是来帮助你们管理的，我们不是来帮助你们编写代码的，我们不是来帮助你们构建特性的。我们来这里只是为了帮助你们成长，帮助你们的经济，如果你们需要帮助的话，来敲我们的门，我们会尽力帮助你们。”当我们问的时候，他们真的很有帮助，比如招聘或者其他类似的东西。他们有时会遇到潜在的候选人，告诉他们为什么要加入WhatsApp。红杉真的很棒。

It was a brand, and I remember actually, when we had multiple terms sheets,  me and Brain went to Jeff 's house, and we were talking to him.

这是一个品牌，我记得，事实上，当我们有多个条款单，我和大脑去杰夫的房子，我们正在与他交谈。

It  was late in the evening, we were trying to just get advice on what we  should do, and he kind of like looked at all them, and we talked through  all the different term sheets, and then he said, "You know, once you're a Sequoia  company, you're a Sequoia company." It's like that branding is really strong, and it means  a lot.

那是在深夜，我们只是想得到一些关于我们应该做什么的建议，他有点喜欢看所有的，然后我们讨论了所有不同的学期表，然后他说，“你知道，一旦你是红杉公司，你就是红杉公司。”就像这个品牌真的很强大，这意味着很多。

Speaker 9: I have an important one.

演讲者9：我有一个重要的问题。

Jan Koum: Yes, welcome. For you.

简·库姆：好的，欢迎。为了你。

Speaker 9: How did you get your first few thousand users back in the day with set  the status?
Jan Koum: Oh, oh. How did we get our few thousand users? So there was no apps  back then, and iOS ... Well, it wasn't iOS back then, it was iPhone OS,  and the Apple Store had this category, What's New, and the trick was to submit  a new app like every few days so you would always show up on top  of What's New. You would make a small change to the name, because I think  back in the old days, the name difference triggered you as new app. So we  would basically have Status, and then it would say like, "Status for your smart phone,"  or "Status for your calls," or "Status for your iPhone," or, "Updated status." We would  basically tweak the name a little bit with every new version we'd submit, which always  kept us almost always at the top of the New category, and since there were  no apps, people would go to What's New category all the time to try to  download whatever people would build, because today you have thousands of apps, you have like  hundreds. Basically, by gaming the systema little bit, we're able to ...

演讲者9：你是如何让你的第一批几千名用户在一天中重新设置状态的？简·库姆：哦，噢。我们是如何得到几千名用户的？当时没有应用程序，iOS.好吧，那时候不是iOS，而是iPhone操作系统，苹果商店有这个类别，是新的，诀窍是每隔几天提交一个新的应用程序，这样你就会总是出现在“新”的上面。你会对这个名字做一个小小的改动，因为我回想起在过去，名字的不同触发了你作为一个新的应用程序。所以我们基本上是有状态的，然后它会说，“你的智能手机的状态”，或者“你的电话的状态”，或者“你的iPhone的状态”，或者，“更新状态”。我们基本上会在提交的每一个新版本中稍微修改一下名称，这总是让我们几乎总是处于新类别的顶端，而且由于没有应用程序，人们会一直使用新类别的东西来下载人们会构建的东西，因为现在你有成千上万的应用程序，你有上百个应用程序。基本上，通过游戏系统，我们可以.

I think the  loophole got closed really quickly, but luckily by that time we already had messaging. Yeah.

我认为漏洞很快就被堵住了，但幸运的是，那时我们已经收到了消息。嗯

Speaker 10: How did you scout out your company? I mean, how do you scout out WhatsApp  into different countries?
Jan Koum: How did we scout into different countries?
Speaker 10: Yeah.

演讲者10：你是如何侦察你的公司的？我是说，你是如何在不同的国家侦察WhatsApp的？简·库姆：我们是如何侦察到不同国家的？演讲者10：是的。

Jan Koum: We didn't have to scout. Well, we did have to a couple of things, I  take it back. There were two things that we had to do. One, we had  to build different platforms, because there were some countries where iPhones just didn't exist, and  everybody was using either Nokia, or BlackBerry, or a combination of two. The second thing  that we started doing early on is focusing on localization, right? So again, this kind  of goes back to Silicon Valley bubble where everybody in Silicon only speaks English, therefore  the rest of the world must speak English. Not quite. So we focused early on  on localization. We actually hired people internally into the company who were doing two things.  There were customer support representatives, so they would help people with problems, and write FAQs  and help debug issues. They were also all multilingual, so we would hire somebody who  was perfect in Spanish, and we would hire someone who is perfect in German, and  would hire someone who is perfect in Portuguese, and we would hire somebody who is  perfect in Italian. We would hire somebody who is perfect in all these languages where  our apps were starting to grow so we could build a really good, localized experience.  When you download WhatsApp in Brazil, it's not in English, it's in Portuguese.

简·库姆：我们不需要侦察。嗯，我们确实有几件事要做，我收回。我们必须做两件事。第一，我们必须构建不同的平台，因为有些国家的iPhone根本不存在，每个人都在使用诺基亚、黑莓或两者的结合。我们很早就开始做的第二件事就是专注于本地化，对吗？所以，这种情况又回到了硅谷的泡沫，硅谷里的每个人都只会说英语，所以世界上的其他人都必须说英语。不完全是。所以我们很早就专注于本土化。实际上，我们在公司内部雇佣了做两件事的人。有客户支持代表，因此他们将帮助有问题的人，编写常见问题并帮助调试问题。他们也都是多种语言的，所以我们会雇佣一个在西班牙语上很完美的人，我们会雇佣一个在德语上很完美的人，会雇佣一个在葡萄牙语中很完美的人，我们会雇佣一个在意大利语上很完美的人。我们会雇佣那些在所有这些语言中都很完美的人，在这些语言中，我们的应用程序开始成长，这样我们就可以建立一种非常好的本地化体验。当你在巴西下载WhatsApp时，它不是英语，而是葡萄牙语。

I think  that is what helped us grow in all these countries. Yeah.

我认为这正是帮助我们在所有这些国家发展的原因。嗯

Speaker 11: How did you convince your first few employees, I know they came from your personal  network, but how did you convince them to join you?
Jan Koum: It wasn't hard. Most of them were unemployed. So let me see ... So Brian  joined ... Brian left Yahoo, and I think didn't really do anything for like ...  I think he left in '98. So he didn't really do anything for like ten  years. He was one of the early app engineers, so that was one. Chris, my  friend who I knew from Stamford, I think he was doing a start-up that wasn't  really going anywhere, and he was in LA, and he got married to this wonderful  girl whose parents are actually from here. So I think for her, it was an  advantage to move here to be closer to her parents. So I'm like, "Yeah, yeah!  You guys should move. You guys should move, here! Move back to Northern California!" So  it's a combination of her wanting to move to be closer to her parents, and  him not really doing anything and not having a full-time job also contributed. This guy  Eugene, who was one of our early hires, he was working at a company ...  I actually knew him through my social network, we aren't still friends. Like he would  always complain how he hated his job, and how they were trying to screw him  over by promising him stock options and never delivering. He hated it. So I'm like,  "Well, here's a good opportunity." We had, let's see ... Who else? We hired this  guy Michael who was in New York, wasn't really doing anything also. He was referral  through a friend of mine from Yahoo. So there was this guy Michael who I  used to work with at Yahoo, who was working at a start-up and we would  keep in touch, and at some point I was complaining to him how hard it  is to find good engineers that are smart and capable, and can get shit done,  and don't just sit there and theorize. He was like, "Oh, I know a guy,"  calls this guy Michael in New York. So, we randomly call this guy Michael in  New York, and I'm like, "Hey, Michael.

演讲者11：你是如何说服你最初的几个员工的，我知道他们来自你的个人网络，但你是如何说服他们加入你的？简·库姆：这并不难。他们中的大多数人都失业了。让我看看.。所以布莱恩加入了.。布莱恩离开了雅虎，我认为他并没有做任何事情，比如.我想他是在98年离开的。所以他十年来什么都没做。他是早期的应用工程师之一，所以这就是其中之一。克里斯，我在斯坦福德认识的朋友，我想他是在做一个没有真正意义的创业，他在洛杉矶，他嫁给了一个很棒的女孩，她的父母实际上是从这里来的。所以我想对她来说，搬到这里和她父母更亲近是一种优势。所以我说，“是的，是的！你们应该搬走。你们应该离开这里！搬回北加利福尼亚！“因此，这是她想要搬到更靠近她父母的结合，而他没有真正做任何事情，没有全职工作也是有贡献的。这个尤金，是我们早期雇佣的人之一，他在一家公司工作.我其实是通过我的社交网络认识他的，我们已经不是朋友了。就像他总是抱怨他是多么讨厌他的工作，他们是如何试图通过承诺他的股票期权和从来没有交付。他讨厌它。所以我说，“好吧，这是个好机会。”我们有过，让我们看看.。还有谁？我们雇了一个在纽约的迈克尔，他什么也没做。他是通过我的一位雅虎朋友推荐的。所以有个迈克尔，我曾经和他在雅虎工作，他在一家初创公司工作，我们会保持联系。在某个时候，我向他抱怨要找到聪明能干的优秀工程师是多么困难，不能坐以待毙。他说：“哦，我认识一个人。”他在纽约叫迈克尔。所以，我们随机给纽约的迈克尔打电话，我说，“嘿，迈克尔。

I got your name from other Michael. Do  you want to come and interview?" And I figured he would say, "No, I'm pretty  happy in New York," but he wasn't really doing much. He was like, "yeah, okay."  So he came in and interviewed. We had ... Let's see, we had one of  the guys, one of our engineers was in Russia.

我从其他迈克尔那里得到了你的名字。你想去面试吗？“我想他会说，”不，我在纽约很开心，“但他没做什么。他说，”是的，好的。“所以他进来面试了。我们.让我们看看，我们有一个人，我们的一个工程师在俄罗斯。

It was this guy, Igor. He  wasn't really doing much in Russia, also.

是这个人伊戈尔。他在俄罗斯也做得不多。

It's not like they have Silicon Valley in  Russia. We were like this band of outcasts in some way. The group of people  who weren't really doing much, and got together and built a product, but there were  also people who were working full-time who actually had to try really hard to convince  to join. One of the guys, Rick, who helped us a lot, was a backend  as we were scaling the backend, he was working a Yahoo. So I think it  took us six months of meetings and dinners with me and Brian trying to convince  him, and we would meet him ... And we would do it in a very  subtle way. Not like, "Come join us!" We were like, "Oh, you know, we have  all these users, and we have all this ..." and we knew that he was  really, really technical, and he loves solving problems. We weren't saying like, "Come join us,  and we'll give you lots of money or options, or whatever." We were playing a  different angle. We were saying like, "Hi Rick, if you're watching this." We were like,  "Hey Rick, we're having all these technical problems," and we did, "and we just don't  know. There's this weird issue with FreeBSD 8, where it computes for kernel resources with  Erlang, and Erlang is trying to run on these 48 cores, and we don't know  how they're ... There's some contention in the kernel, if only we could figure it  out. We just need some help." And we knew that he loved doing that kind  of stuff, right? So with him we played a different angle, it took us a  few months to convince him, but eventually he joined, and he helped us fix a  lot of bottlenecks in our system. So, they're all different stories, but I think the  bulk of the initial core of people who joined, they were from our professional and  personal networks.

他们在俄罗斯又不是硅谷。在某种程度上我们就像这群被遗弃的人。这群人并没有做什么，他们聚在一起制作了一个产品，但也有一些全职工作的人，他们必须努力说服他们加入。其中一个人，里克，帮助我们很多，是一个后端，当我们正在扩大后端，他是一个雅虎的工作。所以我想我们花了六个月的时间和我和布莱恩试着说服他，然后我们就会见到他.我们会以一种非常微妙的方式来做这件事。不是说“来加入我们”我们说，“哦，你知道，我们有所有这些用户，我们有所有这些.”我们知道他非常，非常专业，他喜欢解决问题。我们不是说，“来加入我们，我们会给你很多钱或选择，或者其他什么。”我们玩的角度不同。我们在说，“嗨，瑞克，如果你在看这个。”我们说，“嘿，瑞克，我们遇到了所有这些技术问题，”我们就是不知道。FreeBSD 8有一个奇怪的问题，它用Erlang计算内核资源，Erlang试图在这48个内核上运行，我们不知道它们是如何的.内核中有一些争议，如果我们能解决的话。我们只是需要一些帮助。“我们知道他喜欢做这种事，对吧？所以我们和他玩了一个不同的角度，我们花了几个月的时间说服他，但最终他加入了，他帮助我们解决了我们系统中的许多瓶颈。所以，它们都是不同的故事，但我认为，最初加入的核心人物大多来自我们的专业和个人网络。

Sam: We are out of time, unfortunately.

山姆：不幸的是，我们没时间了。

Speaker 11: Oh, man! I think you're going
Sam: All right, we'll do one more question.

演讲者11：哦，伙计！山姆：好吧，我们再问一个问题。

Speaker 11: Thank you.

演讲者11：谢谢。

Speaker 12: I think WhatsApp is center role model of being focus.

演讲者12：我认为WhatsApp是焦点的核心角色榜样。

I want to understand your  decision making process when you get feedback from users. How you define it's an asset  to your product? How you define it's a key feature you need to improve, and  how you find out that the efficiency of communicating is a core feature you want  to focus on for so many years?
Jan Koum: How do we know what features to build on, and what features not to build?  And you're absolutely right, because in the early days, people would write in and say,  "We want usernames," or, "We want PINs," because people were so conditioned by all these  messaging apps that came before us, that you need to have a username or PIN.  So like, if you were using DBM, or if you were using ICQ, you had  some random PIN that you would have to exchange with people, or if you were  using Skype or Yahoo Messenger, you had to have a username. People didn't understand that  what we were building was this whole new idea of, you don't need any of  that stuff. You just sign up with your number, and it's connected to your phone  that has the same phone number, and you go. So in early days, a lot  of feedback we took from useful. They were like, "We want groups, we want multimedia,  we want to have additional privacy controls, we want to turn off our last seen."  Great, we built a lot of what people asked, but we also didn't build what  people asked because we didn't think it was the right fit for our product. Like  having the fundamental belief, and the gut feeling that what you're doing is right, and  having that vision of it's just going to work.

当你从用户那里得到反馈时，我想了解你的决策过程。你如何定义它是你的产品的资产？如何定义它是您需要改进的关键特性，以及如何发现沟通的效率是您多年来想要关注的核心特性？简·库姆：我们怎么知道要构建哪些功能，哪些特性不需要构建？你是完全正确的，因为在早期，人们会写信说，“我们想要用户名”或者“我们想要PIN”，因为人们被这些出现在我们面前的消息应用所制约，所以你需要有一个用户名或PIN。比如，如果你使用的是DBM，或者你使用的是ICQ，你有一些随机的PIN，你必须与人交换，或者如果你使用Skype或Yahoo Messenger，你必须有一个用户名。人们不明白我们所建立的是一个全新的想法，你不需要这些东西。你只要注册你的电话号码，它就会连接到你的手机上，而你的电话号码是一样的，然后你就走了。所以在早期，我们从有用的方面得到了很多反馈。他们说，“我们想要团体，我们想要多媒体，我们想要更多的隐私控制，我们想关掉我们最后一次看到的。”很好，我们建造了很多人们要求的东西，但是我们也没有建造人们要求的东西，因为我们认为它不适合我们的产品。比如有基本的信念，有直觉认为你所做的是正确的，而拥有这样的愿景就会奏效。

I'm going to build it using  phone numbers, I'm not going to have usernames, I'm not going to have PINs, because  it makes the product more complicated.

我要用电话号码来构建它，我不会有用户名，也不会有PIN，因为它会使产品更加复杂。

It makes the product to use, people forget their  usernames and PINs and all that stuff. Having that belief in yourself, and knowing that  what you're building is going to work is obviously also important. So that's kind of  how we would make decisions.

它使产品的使用，人们忘记了他们的用户名，PIN和所有的东西。相信自己，并且知道你正在建立的东西是有用的，这显然也很重要。所以这就是我们做决定的方式。

Sam: Okay, you go ahead, and then we'll after the 1:00pm class.

山姆：好吧，你先走，然后下午1点后再上课。

Jan Koum: Yeah.

简·库姆：是的。

Speaker 13: How do you feel about the security issue of future security issues of messenger app?
Jan Koum: What do I feel about security issues or future security issues? Well, for us, as  you know, we rolled out end-to-end encryption, and we weren't the first ones to do  it. Obviously there were apps before us that focused on security, but we were the  first ones to do it on such a global scale for everybody seamlessly, right? I  mean, there is no other app today that has more than a billion people that  has end-to-end encryption enabled by default into everything you do.

演讲者13：你对信使应用未来安全问题的安全问题有什么看法？简·库姆：我对安全问题或未来的安全问题有什么看法？对我们来说，正如你所知道的，我们推出了端到端的加密技术，而我们并不是第一个这么做的人。很明显，我们面前的应用程序都专注于安全，但我们是第一个在全球范围内无缝地为每个人做这件事的人，对吧？我的意思是，今天没有其他的应用程序拥有超过10亿人，默认情况下，你所做的每一件事都有端到端的加密。

Individual chats, group chats, and  everything else. So, we didn't start out ... Again, this kind of goes back to  what we started with.

个人聊天，小组聊天，以及其他一切。所以我们没有开始.。再一次，这种情况可以追溯到我们刚开始的时候。

It was just a pure one-on-one messaging, right? There was no  group chat, there was no multimedia, there was no end-to-end encryption, there was no video  callings, there was no voice callings. There was none of that, but over years we  made a commitment to our users that we were going to add all those features,  and we were going to make them work, and make them work really well. So  obviously, we feel strongly that encryption is important, and we feel strongly about end-to-end encryption,  which is why we added it, and which is why we have it in our  application today.

只是一对一的信息，对吧？没有集体聊天，没有多媒体，没有端到端加密，没有视频呼叫，没有语音呼叫。没有，但多年来，我们向用户承诺，我们将添加所有这些功能，我们将使他们工作，并使他们的工作真的很好。所以很明显，我们强烈认为加密是重要的，我们对端到端加密也有强烈的感觉，这就是为什么我们加入了它，这也是为什么我们今天在我们的应用程序中使用它。

Sam: Great. Thank you so much.


山姆：太好了。非常感谢
