# How to Raise Money, and How to Succeed Long-Term - Jess Lee, Aaron Harris, & Ali Rowghani

#如何筹集资金，如何长期取得成功-杰茜·李，亚伦·哈里斯和阿里·罗哈尼

Aaron Harris: I am Aaron Harris, I'm one of the partners at Y-Combinator.

亚伦·哈里斯：我是亚伦·哈里斯，我是Y-Combinator的合伙人之一。

I've been working at  YC for a while and I've gotten to fund a lot of companies, and I've  gotten to see a lot of companies raise money, everything from seeds to As to  Bs to Cs, to weirdo in-between rounds. So I'm really looking forward to sharing some  of those lessons, but mostly I really want to learn and chat with my guest  over here, Jess Lee from Sequoia. Jess, do you want to introduce yourself?
Jess Lee: Sure.

我在YC工作了一段时间，我资助了很多公司，我看到很多公司都在筹集资金，从种子到BS到Cs，再到怪人。所以我真的很期待分享其中的一些经验，但大部分时间我真的很想和我的客人，红杉的杰茜·李(Jess Lee)一起学习和聊天。杰西，你想自我介绍吗？杰茜·李：当然。

I'm Jess. Back in 2004 I was sitting where you guys are, I think  I took databases in this room, but I studied computer science and then went to  Google where I was a PM for Google Maps, and then co-founded a company called  Polyvore and was CEO there. Then in the last six months, I am not at  Sequoia Capital as a partner.

我是杰茜。早在2004年，我坐在你们的位置上，我想我在这间屋子里收集了数据库，但我学习了计算机科学，然后去了谷歌，当时我是谷歌地图公司(Google Maps)的一名首相，然后联合创立了一家名为Polyvore的公司，并在那里担任首席执行官。在过去的六个月里，我并不是红杉资本的合伙人。

Aaron Harris: So, Sequoia is a reasonably well-known venture capital list firm.

亚伦·哈里斯：红杉是一家相当有名的风险投资公司.

It's actually one of the  first firms in the Valley, one of the longest running, and probably the most successful.  What have you learned in just six months, I guess about the people coming in  the door? What distinguishes off the bat people who are succeeding or who can succeed  in fundraising? What do you want to see?
Jess Lee: Yeah, so part of what we look for at Sequoia is we're looking for really  daring founders who want to build really legendary companies. So at Sequoia we back folks  like at Apple, Google, Yahoo, Airbnb, DropBox, and Strype. So part of what we look  for is a founder who's special in some way, has some unique insight, and for  me in particular because for me, Polyvore was an eight and a half year journey  of crazy highs and crazy lows.

它实际上是硅谷最早的公司之一，也是运行时间最长的公司之一，而且可能是最成功的公司之一。你在短短六个月里学到了什么，我猜那些进来的人是怎么回事？什么是区别于蝙蝠谁是成功的人或谁可以成功的筹款？你想看哪个？是的，所以我们在红杉寻找的部分原因是，我们正在寻找真正大胆的创始人，他们想要建立真正的传奇公司。所以在红杉，我们支持苹果，谷歌，雅虎，Airbnb，Dropbox和Strype。所以我们要找的是一个在某种程度上与众不同的创始人，他有一些独特的洞察力，尤其是对我来说，波利沃尔是一段长达八年半的疯狂高潮和疯狂低谷之旅。

It's really hard, it's just right off the bat,  like the odds are against you, it's almost irrational to start a company, because the  odds are so bad. So you need to have a lot of grit. So that's  definitely something we look for. Then I think one of the other things is a  really clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve, right, I think that's something  that really distinguishes people.

这真的很难，就像机会对你一样，创办一家公司几乎是不理性的，因为机会太大了。所以你需要有很多勇气。所以这绝对是我们要找的东西。我认为其他的事情之一就是对你想要解决的问题有一个非常清晰的理解，对吧，我认为这是真正让人与众不同的东西。

I think a lot of people spend time pitching the solution,  but they don't really explain the problem, and it should be so crisp and clear  what the problem is you're solving that the solution almost just floats from that. Then  the third thing we look for is ideally you're working in a really, really big  market where there's line of sight to like billions of dollars of market caps. So  those are some of the things that we look for.

我想很多人花了很多时间提出解决方案，但他们并没有真正解释这个问题，而且它应该是如此清晰和清楚-你要解决的问题是什么-解决方案几乎就是从这个问题上浮出水面。然后我们要寻找的第三件事是，理想情况下，你是在一个非常大的市场上工作，在这个市场上，我们可以看到数十亿美元的市值。所以这些就是我们要寻找的东西。

Aaron Harris: All right, so for me that breaks down into like three different areas, right, there's  the qualities of the founder, right, in terms of the grit. Then there's something that  bridges quality in the problem which is what the problem the way to explain it,  and then the third thing is just how big that opportunity is. So let's take  the three of those. When I think about the first one, that's huge, right? This  concept of grit.

亚伦·哈里斯：好吧，对我来说，这分为三个不同的领域，对吧，这是创办人的品质，对吧，在勇气方面。在这个问题中，有一些东西可以将质量联系起来，这就是问题的解释方法，然后第三件事就是这个机会有多大。我们来看看其中的三个。当我想到第一个，那是很大的，对吗？这个概念的勇气。

It's really hard to assess that.

这真的很难评估。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: In someone.

亚伦·哈里斯：在某人身上。

I mean you see someone on the street, you don't know if they're  tough. They may tell you a little bit about their lives, maybe that tells you  they're tough.

我是说，你在街上看到一个人，你不知道他们是否坚强。他们可能会告诉你一些他们的生活，也许这说明他们很坚强。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: I know how we think about it. We look at people and we actually want  to see how founders interact, right, we see how founders talk to each other and  how they think about the idea that they're working on and what they've actually done  in the past, have they demonstrated fortitude and toughness? How do you judge it though?  You spend more time with the founders usually before investing. Are there tests that you  make them run? Did you drop them in the middle of a forest with a  knife and a ball of twine?
Jess Lee: No, nothing like that.

亚伦·哈里斯：我知道我们是怎么想的。我们观察人们，我们实际上希望看到创始人是如何互动的，对吧，我们看到了创始人如何相互交谈，他们如何思考他们正在努力的想法以及他们过去所做的事情，他们是否表现出坚韧不拔和坚韧不拔的精神呢？不过，你怎么判断呢？你花更多的时间和创始人在一起，通常是在投资之前。有测试让他们运行吗？你是用刀子和一团麻绳把它们扔到森林中间的吗？杰西·李：不，不是这样的。

I think grit can come from a lot of different places,  right? Like it could come from you having, for example we often ask about the  inspiration for the company, right? Is it something that you're really passionate about that drives  you that you have to solve this problem, or is this something you just thought  would be a good business idea, but like getting through the roller coaster, there's got  to be something that gets you through each of those really difficult moments. So sometimes  it's because you just care about the problem so much, and there's an inspiring story  there, like you're solving a problem you have, your family had, something that shaped you  in your life, so that's one form of grit. Then there's like you said, there's  people who have demonstrated continued ability to like just run through walls and break down  problems and sometimes that shows up in previous work history, previous things that they've done.  Then there's also another form of grit, which is just I mean sometimes it shows  up in completely naïve optimism, and sometimes it's almost better to be a little naïve  and inexperienced about something, 'cause you don't know how hard it's going to be, you  just keeping going, you just very positive outlook, and sometimes it comes from like a  chip on your shoulder where you just like really need to prove yourself, like something's  driving you, you've been underestimated your whole life, and so you just keep going, you  have this desire to prove yourself, so those are some of the different forms that  grit can take.

我认为勇气可以来自很多不同的地方，对吗？比如，我们经常问公司的灵感，对吧？是你真正热爱的东西驱使你去解决这个问题，还是你认为这是一个好的商业想法，但是就像度过过山车一样，一定有一些东西能让你度过每一个真正困难的时刻。所以有时候是因为你非常关心这个问题，有一个鼓舞人心的故事，就像你在解决一个问题，你的家庭，你生活中塑造了你的东西，所以这是一种勇气。然后就像你说的，有些人表现出了持续的能力，他们喜欢穿过墙壁，解决问题，有时这会出现在以前的工作历史中，他们以前做过的事情。还有另一种形式的勇气，我的意思是，有时候它完全是天真的乐观主义，有时对某件事有点天真和缺乏经验几乎更好，因为你不知道它有多难，你只是坚持，你只是非常积极的前景，有时它来自你的肩膀上的一个芯片，你在那里。就像真的需要证明自己，就像某种东西在驱使着你，你被低估了一生，所以你一直坚持下去，你有一种证明自己的欲望，所以这些都是勇气可以采取的不同形式。

Aaron Harris: But as a founder, how does a founder convince you that they have those things?  Do they tell you those stories?
Jess Lee: Yeah.

艾伦·哈里斯：但作为一名创始人，创始人如何让你相信他们拥有这些东西呢？他们告诉你那些故事了吗？杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: Okay.

亚伦·哈里斯：好的。

Jess Lee: So we always try to dig in and try to find out what the inspiration  for the company is, so that often is telling. Then you just with your interactions  with someone you can kind of ask them about their background, what they did before.  Some people have been starting companies from an early age, some people have worked on  multiple businesses, like those are some small signs, but at the end of the day  a lot of it's also just about click with the investor that you're working with,  and whether they see themselves working, because you have to remember like great companies take,  I think on average it takes about eight years to exit, so when you and  your founder-
Aaron Harris: It's actually gone up.

杰茜·李：所以我们总是试着挖掘，并试图找出公司的灵感所在，所以这通常都是有说服力的。然后你只需要和一个人交流，你就可以问他们的背景，他们以前做过什么。有些人从很小的时候就开始创业，有些人从事多种业务，比如这些都是一些小的迹象，但在一天结束时，很多事情也只是与你一起工作的投资者的点击，以及他们是否认为自己在工作，因为你必须记住像伟大的公司一样，我认为这平均来说是需要的。大约八年后，当你和你的创始人亚伦·哈里斯(Aaron Harris)：实际上是上升了。

Jess Lee: Okay.

杰西·李：好的。

Aaron Harris: Average time to IPO is now something like 11 years.

亚伦·哈里斯：现在上市的平均时间大概是11年。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

I meant exit, so even just acquisition.

我是说退出，所以即使是收购。

Aaron Harris: Right.

亚伦·哈里斯：对。

Jess Lee: But you're partnering with a person who you're going to be like ...

但是你和一个你将要成为的人合作.

It's a  long term relationship you're getting into, especially once you start to get to your Series  A and B. So you want to find someone who you have good fit with.  Like it's almost like you're ...

这是一个长期的关系，你正在进入，特别是当你开始进入你的A和B系列，所以你想找到一个你很适合的人。就好像你.

It's someone you're going to be married to for  ten years, except you can't get divorced, because it's very hard to like you can't  kick your investors off your cap table very easily, so it's something to really important  to think about as you prioritize picking an investor. So you kind of have to  spend a little bit of that time I guess dating and getting to know each  other.

这是一个你将要结婚十年的人，除了你不能离婚，因为你很难喜欢你不能轻易地把你的投资者踢出你的上限，所以在你优先挑选一个投资者的时候，这是非常重要的事情。所以你得花点时间，我想是约会和互相了解。

Aaron Harris: Yeah.  If that makes sense.

亚伦·哈里斯：是的。如果这有意义的话。

Aaron Harris: That's a super good point, this idea that you can't kick someone off your cap  table. People I think often cavalierly take money, because they say, "Oh look, I just  need some money, oh this person offered me money." We always get these questions from  founders saying, "Oh, this random person just offered me ten, 50, 100, 200,000 dollars." Like  people do crazy things on fast meetings. One of the hardest things to do at  seed, at A, at B, is decide who it is that you're going to take  money from. Now I'd say, if you get to decide, you're actually in a pretty  good situation, because the first rule is get the money you need to run your  business. Now if there are more people offering you money than you theoretically have room  for, then you start to get choosy. How do you build a competitive dynamic in  a round? How do you get people interested? Now you're all hopefully starting small companies  that are going to be startups that are going to get big, so one day  you're going to want to go out and convince a whole bunch of people you're  going to be the next Google. So how do you build a competitive dynamic in  that fundraising?
Jess Lee: So I think first of all, you can't go into fundraising as like a casual  side thing that you do 20 percent.

亚伦·哈里斯：这是一个超级好的观点，你不能把别人从你的帽子桌上踢下来。我认为那些人往往傲慢地接受金钱，因为他们说，“哦，看，我只是需要一些钱，哦，这个人给了我钱。”我们总是从创始人那里得到这样的问题：“哦，这个随机的人刚刚给了我10，50，100，200，000美元。”就像人们在快速会议上做疯狂的事情一样。最难做的事情之一，在种子，在A，在B，是决定它是谁，你要从谁的钱。现在我想说，如果你能做出决定，你实际上处于一个相当好的状况，因为第一条规则是获得你经营企业所需的资金。现在，如果给你钱的人比理论上有空间的人多，那么你就开始挑剔了。如何在一轮中建立竞争动力？你怎么让人感兴趣？现在，你们都希望能创办一些小公司，这些小公司将成为大公司，所以总有一天，你会想出去说服一大群人，你将成为下一个谷歌(Google)。那么，你如何在筹资过程中建立一个竞争的动力呢？杰茜·李：所以我认为首先，你不能像你20%做的那样，像一件随意的事那样进行募捐。

It's actually better to just be really dedicated  to it, and just like all right, I know it sucks because I have to  step away from running my business, but I'm going to go all in and just  work on this process, and you kind of think about it as a process and  time it so you have conversations at the right time.

更好的做法是专注于这件事，就像好的一样，我知道这很糟糕，因为我不得不放弃经营我的公司，但我会全力以赴，只在这个过程中工作，你会把它看作是一个过程，然后把它当作一个时间，这样你就可以在合适的时间和时间进行交谈了。

I think you want to  prioritize like the people that you talk to based on how much you want to  work with them, times sort of maybe the likelihood that you might be able to  and just work your way through. But you can also just kind of tell I  think when you have conversations with investors, like this is someone who I can imagine  working with for the next ten years, this is someone who I cannot. So you'll  start to feel that click, but really it's all about timing it together and almost  running almost like you're trying to run a competitive process, right? You have to I  think be subtle about letting people know and trying to set timelines and milestones, like  I'm hoping to get this done by this date.

我认为你想要优先考虑和你交谈的人，根据你想要和他们合作的程度，时间可能是你有能力和你的方式完成的可能性。但是你也可以告诉我，当你和投资者交谈的时候，就像我可以想象在接下来的十年里和他一起工作的人，这是一个我无法想象的人。所以，你会开始感觉到点击，但实际上，这一切都是关于计时，几乎运行几乎就像你试图运行一个竞争的过程，对吗？你必须-我想-让人们知道并试图设定时间表和里程碑，就像我希望在这个日期之前完成这件事一样。

I think being clear about your  expectations helps a lot, setting that timeline and saying, "I'm going into second conversations," like  a few of them this week, and then just keeping everyone informed of the timeline  so that you create as much as possible that competitive situation.

我认为明确你的期望很有帮助，设定时间表，然后说，“我要进入第二次对话”，就像本周的几次对话，然后让每个人都知道时间表，这样你就能创造出尽可能多的竞争局面。

Aaron Harris: I think that turning this into a process, turning fundraising into a process is something  a lot of people ignore, because they want to believe the stories of, "Oh, you  know, I just I happened to pitch this person, we hit it off, and all  of a sudden they gave me this money and it was amazing." But the way  to do this is actually build a spreadsheet.

亚伦·哈里斯：我认为把这个转变成一个过程，把筹款变成一个过程是很多人忽视的，因为他们想相信这样的故事：“哦，你知道，我只是碰巧向这个人推销，我们很合得来，突然他们给了我这些钱，这真是太棒了。”但要做到这一点，实际上是构建一个电子表格。

It seems crazy, but put every single  person you want to talk to in that spreadsheet, and note when you reached out  to them, what their response was. When you met with them, what the result of  the conversation was. Probability weight those conversations, just by how much they're likely to give  you and the likelihood that they're going to give you that money. Then you can  start to decide who you want to spend time on. Now this changes between the  seed and the A in terms of the time that you expect. So if you're  talking to angels, one or two meetings, coffees, right? You need to have like some  sort of, well actually we'll talk about deck in a second. You don't need that  much material for pitching an angel.

这似乎很疯狂，但是把你想要交谈的每一个人都放在电子表格里，当你联系他们时，要注意他们的反应是什么。当你和他们见面时，谈话的结果是什么。这些谈话的重要性取决于他们可能给你多少，以及他们给你钱的可能性。然后你可以开始决定你想花时间在谁身上。现在，这改变了种子和A之间的时间，你所期望的。所以如果你在和天使说话，一两次会面，咖啡，对吧？你需要一些类似的东西，好吧，我们一会儿再谈甲板。你不需要那么多的材料来投球天使。

If you're going an pitching Series A funds like  Sequoia, you have to have a lot more together, right? You have to be ready  for longer conversations that are more in depth, right?
Jess Lee: I will say though I think the line between seed and A is kind of  blurring, has been shifting over the years. So Polyvore raised our Series A in 2007,  and that was a two and a half million dollar round or 2.6 I think.  Now that seems more like a seed. So I think it can bleed.

如果你要去像红杉这样的A系列基金，你必须有更多的在一起，对吗？你必须为更深入的对话做好准备，对吧？李杰斯：虽然我认为种子和A之间的界限有点模糊，但这些年来一直在变化。因此，波利沃尔在2007年提高了我们的A系列，那是250万美元，我想是2.6美元。这看起来更像是一颗种子。所以我觉得它会流血。

I think  when you're doing pre-seed it's definitely more the angels. But there are plenty of micro-VC's  as well as firms like Sequoia that participate at the seed stage so just, you  know, you have to be more buttoned up like the more, like I think the  larger the fund size, but it is interesting, I've definitely noticed a huge shift in  the size of rounds getting bigger and bigger and then they're starting to be called  A's later, what used to be a B is now an A.

我想当你做种子前的时候，更多的是天使。但是有大量的微型风投公司和红杉这样的公司在种子阶段参与，所以，你知道，你必须像我认为基金规模越大那样，更多地扣子，但有趣的是，我已经注意到轮的规模发生了巨大的变化，然后他们开始被称为后来，过去是B的现在是A。

Aaron Harris: Right, the price at which they're done is more equivalent, I mean seeds are now  being done at prices that are significantly higher than A's were done even three years  ago. Now that's not always the case, right that happens to be the case in  the hot house of Silicon Valley, especially if you're doing something like Y-C, prices will  be higher than they might be otherwise, or if you're a well-known founder or things  like that. But I think people who get hung up on the amount of money  you're raising or the price at which you raise are doing a disservice to the  company.

亚伦·哈里斯：对，它们的价格是相当的，我的意思是，现在种子的价格远高于三年前A的价格。现在情况并不总是这样，在硅谷的热点地区，尤其是如果你在做类似于Y-C的事情，价格会比其他地方高，或者如果你是知名的创始人或者诸如此类的事情。但我认为，那些为你筹集的资金或你筹集的资金所付出的代价而陷入困境的人，是在损害公司的利益。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: We talked about this the other day.

亚伦·哈里斯：我们前几天谈过这个问题。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: That like people come in and like, "Oh, I have to raise five million at  15 for my seed," why? I mean you're actually probably hurting the chances of your  company by raising too much money too fast, because you're setting the hurdles for your  company way too high.

亚伦·哈里斯：就像人们进来说，“哦，我要在15岁的时候为我的种子筹到500万美元，”为什么？我的意思是，你可能因为筹集太多资金太快而损害了你的公司的机会，因为你给你的公司设置了太高的障碍。

Jess Lee: Yeah, you're not in some competition to try to have the biggest valuation, right, you  need to, independent of everyone else in the market and all your competitors, like you  need to think about what is the business plan that you have, what are the  milestones you need to achieve, kind of at, and then what's maybe 12 to 18  months of runway, or what's the money you could use to accelerate that plan, right?  Think about it that way, and then try to minimize dilution, right. But at the  end of the day, like if you're going to be worth billions of dollars, or  hundreds of millions of dollars, though sometimes people overoptimize on valuation.

是的，你并不是为了获得最高的估值而竞争，对吧，你需要独立于市场上的其他人和你的所有竞争对手，就像你需要考虑你的商业计划是什么，你需要达到的里程碑是什么，在跑道上大概有12到18个月，或者你能用多少钱来加速这个计划，对吧？这样想，然后尽量减少稀释，对吧。但是在一天结束的时候，就像你将价值数十亿美元，或者数亿美元，尽管有时人们对估值过高。

If you think about  all the things you could be thinking about, like the valuation in the terms, the  person that you're working with, the individual partner, and then maybe the reputation or the  firm that you work with, and the brand, and within the firm I think the  two things to look at are the firm's network, as well as the community of  founders that you step into, right? Because as much as like getting help from your  peers who are other founders and other CEO's, and rubbing shoulders with like really amazing  founders who help you out but then also elevate your game, like that's really really  important. That's really something to look for.

如果你想一想你可以考虑的所有事情，比如你的估值，和你一起工作的人，个人合伙人，也许是你与之共事的声誉或公司，以及品牌，在公司内部，我认为两件事是公司的网络，以及你所涉足的创始人群体，对吗？因为就像从其他创始人和其他CEO那里得到你的同事的帮助一样，和那些非常出色的创始人擦肩而过，他们帮助了你，同时也提升了你的游戏水平，这是非常重要的。那真的是要找的东西。

Aaron Harris: Yeah, I think that the research ahead of time on whoever you're talking to is  ...

亚伦·哈里斯：是的，我认为对你谈话对象的研究是.

Jess Lee: That helps, too.

杰茜·李：这也有帮助。

Aaron Harris: People don't do it. People walk into meetings cold or people start talking to investors  or perspective investors knowing nothing about what they want, what they've invested before, what their  interests are, and it's amazing how important those personal connections are, and that knowledge. People  really do treat well when you know something about them, when you don't expect them  to just bring everything to you.

亚伦·哈里斯：人们不会这么做的。人们冷冷地走进会议，或者人们开始与投资者或透视投资者交谈，不知道他们想要什么，他们以前投资过什么，他们的兴趣是什么，令人惊讶的是，这些个人关系和知识有多么重要。当你对他们有所了解时，当你不希望他们把一切都带给你的时候，人们真的会很好地对待他们。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: Remember, it's a two way street, right, it's a partnership like you said.

亚伦·哈里斯：记住，这是一条双向的街道，对吧，就像你说的那样。

Jess Lee: Right.

杰茜·李：对。

I mean I think the same goes in the other direction, right, like if  you walk in and your investor's like what's your name again, and like what do  you do, and like has not prepared at all, like that's also kind of a  bad sign, so ...

我的意思是，我认为这也是另一个方向，对吧，如果你走进来，你的投资者又像你的名字一样，你做什么，就像完全没有准备，就像这也是一个坏兆头，所以.

Aaron Harris: That's a terrible sign.

亚伦·哈里斯：这是个可怕的征兆。

Jess Lee: It's a two way street, like your interview, you're evaluating your investors just as much  as they're evaluating you. You want someone who's going to be hard working who you  feel comfortable with, who can be your first phone call, right? Like startups like I  said, it's just like roller coaster, epic highs, epic lows, like in your epic lows,  like you want someone who's going to be a shock absorber, and help you through  that, not hit the panic button and be like ah, let's all run around like  chickens with our heads cut off and panic and then make you make it worse  for you, make it worse for your team. You want someone who has seen downs  before, knows what to do and can help you out of them, and then also  when you're at your epic high, you don't want someone who's just like ra-ra, cheerleader,  'cause there's always something around the corner that could tank you. So you want someone  who's sort of a sparring partner, right, who like says, like have you thought about  this, someone who pushes you and challenges you to go even greater. So that's I  mean that's certainly part of our philosophy as board members at Sequoia.

李：这是一个双向的街道，就像你的采访一样，你对你的投资者的评价和他们对你的评价一样多。你想要一个能让你感到舒服的努力工作的人，谁能成为你的第一个电话，对吗？就像我说过的创业公司，就像过山车，史诗般的高潮，史诗般的低谷，就像你的史诗般的低谷，你想要一个能成为减震器的人，帮你度过难关，而不是按下惊慌的按钮，就像啊，让我们像鸡一样跑来跑去，我们的头被砍掉，惊慌失措，然后让你变得更糟，让你的团队更糟。你想要一个以前经历过挫折的人，知道该怎么做，并能帮你摆脱困境，然后当你处于史诗般的高度时，你不想要一个像拉拉队长那样的人，因为总会有什么东西可以把你击垮。所以，你想要的是一个有打斗能力的人，对吧，就像你曾经想过的那样，一个推动你前进的人，向你提出更大挑战的人。所以，我的意思是，作为红杉的董事会成员，这当然是我们哲学的一部分。

Aaron Harris: You know, one of the hardest things to do for investors, actually, is to give  good feedback when things are going well that isn't about, "Oh my God, you're going  to kill it, it's going to be the best," 'cause I'll tell you, as a  founder, you want to hear the best story of yourself. Right, you believe the best  story of yourself. Right, you believe the best story of your future, and it feels  so good when an investor, this fancy investor comes in and says, "Ah, you're totally  right, you are going to conquer the world." That advice is super easy to listen  to, 'cause it's just a confirmation bias thing, right? On the other hand, you don't  want an investor who comes in and just beats you up over everything you do.

亚伦·哈里斯：你知道，对投资者来说最难做的事情之一，实际上是在事情进展顺利的时候给出好的反馈，而不是“哦，我的天，你会杀了它，它会是最好的”，因为我会告诉你，作为一个创办人，你想要听到自己最好的故事。对，你相信自己最好的故事。是的，你相信你未来最好的故事，当一个投资者，这个花哨的投资者走进来说，“啊，你是完全正确的，你要征服世界时，感觉真好。”这个建议很容易听，因为这只是确认偏见，对吧？另一方面，你不希望有一个投资者进来，只是为了你所做的每件事而击败你。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: Finding that medium in the relationship, and finding a relationship where both sides can have  that conversation is huge. When I, so Sequoia was one of my investors, and Brian  Schrier and I used to do this, and he was super supportive about the good  things, and on the things that needed fixing, he didn't yell at me, but he  pointed them out logically, it's like, oh, that's actually a good point. That's why he  was a valuable investor.

亚伦·哈里斯：找到这种关系中的媒介，找到一种双方都能进行这种对话的关系是很重要的。当我，所以红杉是我的投资者之一，布赖恩·施里尔和我曾经这样做，他对好的事情非常支持，在需要修复的事情上，他没有对我大喊大叫，但是他有逻辑地指出，这就像是，哦，这实际上是一个很好的观点。所以他是个有价值的投资者。

I think a lot of investors refuse to do that, 'cause  they just want to be best friends.

我认为很多投资者拒绝这样做，因为他们只是想成为最好的朋友。

Jess Lee: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah, that's not good.

杰茜·李：嗯-嗯(是的)，是的，那可不好。

Aaron Harris: I think investors want to be your best friend, not good.

亚伦·哈里斯：我认为投资者想成为你最好的朋友，而不是好朋友。

Jess Lee: That's not an optimal model, yeah.

杰茜·李：这不是一个最理想的模型，是的。

I mean it can be kind of tempting, but  I think that ultimately isn't good in the long run for you or for your  company.

我的意思是，这可能是一种诱惑，但我认为，从长远来看，这对你或你的公司都是不好的。

I think the other model that's not great is the person who's totally uninvolved,  you know, like you want your investors to work hard for you, too, right? So  that's another sort of bad model. What's another not so- oh, the one who's too  involved, who wants to like tell you exactly where your UI and your buttons need  to go, and like sometimes things like, "Well my sister or my daughter uses your  product, and said blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." Sometimes that feedback can be sent in  a constructive way, but if it's, you know, I've got this one data point for  you, I don't know anything about your product, and I think you should do this,  and being very prescriptive about it, that's not good either.

我认为另一个不太好的模式是完全不参与的人，你知道，就像你希望你的投资者也为你努力工作一样，对吧？这是另一种糟糕的模式。另一个不是这样的-哦，那个太投入的人，他想告诉你的UI和按钮需要去哪里，有时就像，“我姐姐或我的女儿使用你的产品，然后说废话。”有时反馈可以建设性的方式发送，但如果是，你知道，我有一个数据点给你，我对你的产品一无所知，我认为你应该这么做，而且对它很有指令性，这也不好。

Aaron Harris: Yeah, so investors need to know what their relationship to the company is. Here's a  maybe counterintuitive tip: try not to take office space in your investor's offices for a  long time. This is this thing that's like really tempting, because hey, there's some free  office space, and hey, there's this perk that you get with it or come work  in our accelerator or incubator. You don't want your investor over your shoulder all the  time.

亚伦·哈里斯：是的，所以投资者需要知道他们与公司的关系。这里有一个可能违反直觉的提示：试着在很长一段时间内不要占用投资者办公室的办公空间。这是一件非常诱人的事情，因为这里有一些免费的办公空间，还有一些额外的好处，你可以在我们的加速器或孵化器里工作。你不希望你的投资者总是在你的肩膀上。

It really inhibits culture, and crazy things. Right because you know that your investor  is going to come look at your spreadsheet or look at your product, you're not  going to try the super weird, crazy idea that you had, because it needs a  little room to grow at the .

它确实抑制了文化和疯狂的事情。因为你知道你的投资者会来看你的电子表格或者你的产品，你不会去尝试你所拥有的这个非常奇怪的疯狂的想法，因为它需要一个小的空间来成长。

Jess Lee: That's interesting.

杰茜·李：这很有趣。

I guess I think if it's going to be an investor who comes  over and like stands over your computer and like says, like, "What's in that spreadsheet?"  Definitely, definitely not. But I think there are models where you can get office space  and not have that relationship, 'cause many times, investors are like running around too also  just talking to a lot of companies, so they might not be there. The other  thing is, if you've got another company in the same space with you, that can  be really awesome, right? Because then you've got a peer group, maybe ideally they're not  super competitive, but you get that founder-to-founder support and that camaraderie, and I think that's  a good reason to sometimes take investor office space.

我想，如果是一个投资者过来，站在你的电脑上，然后说，“电子表格里有什么？”绝对肯定不是。但我认为有些模式可以让你得到办公空间，而不是那种关系，因为很多时候，投资者就像到处跑来跑去，也只是在和很多公司交谈，所以他们可能不在那里。另一件事是，如果你有另一家公司和你在同一空间，那就真的很棒了，对吧？因为这样你就有了一个同龄人群体，也许他们不是超级有竞争力，但你得到了创始人对创始人的支持和那种友谊，我认为这是一个很好的理由，有时可以占用投资者的办公空间。

Aaron Harris: Yeah, I think yeah, there are two sides to that one.

亚伦·哈里斯：是的，我想是的，那是有两面的。

Jess Lee: Yeah, yeah.

是的，是的。

Aaron Harris: One of the things you said really jumped out at me, because it's something that  we work on a lot with our founders, is this idea of being able to  clearly communicate the problem and what your solution is. Why is that valuable?
Jess Lee: So you have to remember that you know your problem cold, right? Like whatever space  you're in, the problem you're solving, you've spent like hours and hours thinking about it,  and you're talking to someone who may not know anything about your space.

亚伦·哈里斯：你说的其中一件事真的让我大吃一惊，因为这是我们和创始人一起做的一件事，那就是能够清楚地交流问题以及你的解决方案是什么。为什么有价值？杰西·李：所以你必须记住，你知道你的问题很冷，对吗？就像你所处的空间，你正在解决的问题，你花了好几个小时思考这个问题，你在和一个可能对你的空间一无所知的人交谈。

In fact,  I experience this a lot at Polyvore, because so Polyvore is a fashion and shopping  app targeted at women. 94 percent of investors are male, so I couldn't rely on  you know, when I pitched an app saying, "Imagine an app where you could buy  dresses all day," you know, 94 percent of investors would go why would I want  that, that sounds terrible, I hate shopping! So it just didn't work, so you had  to come up with a way to communicate that really clearly. So sometimes it's an  analogy, sometimes it's you know, you've drawn a persona, this is your user, this is  their problem, use a real customer for example. For me what we did is for  Polyvore, we were trying to explain an analogy. So what we did is we took  a stack of fashion magazines, like the Vogue September issue, like this thick. All the  September issues, we took them, we threw them on the table and we said, "This  stack of magazines is like $300 million of revenue in one issue, right? Now imagine  that on the Internet." And people were like, "Oh, I get that." So it's sort  of an analogy, and then we showed graphs, you know, and so you have to  think about your audience, right? If it's a space that they won't understand, you really  have to take more time to explain the problem you're solving, the customer you're solving  for, and then from there you can explain your solution.

事实上，我在Polyvore有很多这样的经历，因为Polyvore是一款针对女性的时尚和购物应用。94%的投资者是男性，所以我不能依赖你知道，当我推出一款应用说，“想象一下你可以整天买衣服的应用程序，”你知道，94%的投资者会去-为什么我会那么做-听起来很糟糕，我讨厌购物。所以它不起作用，所以你必须想出一种方法来很清楚地表达这一点。所以有时候这是一个类比，有时是你知道的，你画了一个角色，这是你的用户，这是他们的问题，比如使用一个真正的客户。对我来说，我们所做的是为波利沃尔，我们试图解释一个类比。所以我们做的是拿了一堆时尚杂志，像九月版的“Vogue”，就像这样厚厚的。9月份的所有问题，我们拿来，我们把它们扔到桌子上，然后我们说，“这一堆杂志就像三亿美元的收入，是吗？现在想象一下，在互联网上。”人们会说，“哦，我明白了。”所以这是一个类比，然后我们展示了图表，你知道，所以你必须考虑你的观众，对吗？如果这是一个他们无法理解的空间，你真的需要花更多的时间来解释你要解决的问题，你要解决的客户，然后你就可以解释你的解决方案了。

I've seen a lot of  people just jump directly to the solution, I'm like wait, what are you solving for?  I don't understand how fish farming works. Why would I know, wait what? So I  mean you just have to just know your audience.

我见过很多人直接跳到解决方案上，我就像在等待，你在解决什么？我不明白养鱼是怎么运作的。我为什么要知道等等什么？所以我的意思是你只需要了解你的观众。

Aaron Harris: Yeah, that communication thing, I'm guessing you've all been working on this with your TA's  and group leaders in terms of encapsulating what you do in a sentence if possible,  and it seems a little esoteric, because oh, I'm building this big complex thing, why  should I have to boil it down? What it is is it's really just this  exercise in condensing and clarifying thought. What we've found what we've seen again and again  is the best founders can communicate clearly, and can adjust their explanation for whoever they're  talking to such that it is meaningful. This changes, right, this is different for the  engineer that you're pitching and the investor you're pitching and the customer that you're pitching,  and telling your parents what you do so they get off your case about the  fact that you're not going to work at Google, but working on a crazy startup.  Like you have to be able to contextualize for people. But that clarity of thought  in the end is a real defining factor when you're going in and pitching.

亚伦·哈里斯：是啊，我猜你们一直在和你们的助教和团队领导合作，如果可能的话，把你们做的事情封装在一个句子里，这看起来有点深奥，因为哦，我在建造这个复杂的大东西，为什么我要把它总结下来呢？。它到底是什么，它只是在凝聚和澄清思想的练习。我们一遍又一遍地发现，最好的创始人能够清晰地沟通，并能调整他们对与谁交谈的解释，使之有意义。这改变了，是的，这是不同的，对于工程师，你推销的投资者和你推销的客户，告诉你的父母你做了什么，让他们从你的例子中了解到你不会在谷歌工作，而是在一家疯狂的创业公司工作。就像你必须能够为人们提供相关的信息。但是，这种清晰的想法最终是一个真正的决定性因素，当你要进去和投球。

I  would also say it's one of the things that tells you that you're ready to  go raise money. Right, and I think this is really tricky. When do I know  that my idea that I've been working on, this project that I've been playing with  on the side is good enough to go raise money.

我还想说，这是告诉你已经准备好去筹集资金的事情之一。对，我觉得这很棘手。我什么时候知道我一直在努力的想法，这个我一直在玩的项目已经足够好去筹集资金了。

I think one of the  things that you can actually describe it and why it's valuable succinctly, and it doesn't  take lots of jargon and a whiteboard to explain all the different dynamics.

我认为其中一件事，你真的可以描述它，为什么它是有价值的简洁，它不需要太多的行话和白板来解释所有不同的动力学。

Jess Lee: Yeah, I think it also says something about a skill that's actually really important in  being a founder, which is, can you take a big, hairy complex problem and then  break it down into simpler problems. Like just how you'd like take a program, you're  writing a program, and you decompose into different functions, like if you can take something  big and break it down into problems and solve those, then that's kind of what  you have to do with your company, right, like whatever problem you're trying to solve  is probably quite large, very complicated, all these moving pieces, can you figure out how  to break them into smaller things and then solve them individually, and that skill is  just being able to do it with your pitch deck and being able to explain  this thing you're working on or have been working on for a few years, and  condense that down, like that is actually very important.

杰茜·李：是的，我认为它也说明了一种技能，这对创业者来说是非常重要的，那就是，你能把一个大的、多毛的复杂问题分解成更简单的问题吗？就像你想要一个程序，你在编写一个程序，你分解成不同的功能，比如你可以把一些大的东西分解成问题，然后解决这些问题，那么这就是你和你的公司必须做的事情，对吧，就像你想要解决的任何问题都很大，很复杂，所有这些移动的部分，你能不能想办法把它们分解成更小的东西，然后单独解决，而这个技能就是能够用你的球场甲板来做，并且能够解释你正在做的或者已经做了几年的事情，然后把它压缩下来，就像这样，这是非常重要的。

It's like a tell of an  important skill for building a startup.

这就像讲述创业的一项重要技能。

Aaron Harris: I think for the last topic, we'll dig into, and honestly fundraising could take up  days of conversation in terms of case studies and role playing how you do it,  and unfortunately we can't do that now. But I think the next point for all  of you as you build your companies is really figuring out when you're ready to  talk to investors.

亚伦·哈里斯：我认为，对于最后一个话题，我们会深入研究，老实说，在案例研究和角色扮演方面，筹款可能要花上几天的时间，但不幸的是，我们现在无法做到这一点。但我认为，对于你们所有人来说，在建立自己的公司的时候，下一个问题是，当你们准备好与投资者交谈时，才能真正弄清楚。

I mentioned it briefly for a second, but this is a really  curious thing to figure out. So, how do you know that you're ready to raise  a round of financing? How do you know that you're ready to take someone's money?
Jess Lee: So I think you might be better to talk about that one at the  friends and family stage, and that very early stage.

我简短地提了一下，但这是一件很奇怪的事情。那么，你怎么知道你已经准备好筹集一轮融资了？你怎么知道你已经准备好拿别人的钱了？杰西·李：所以我认为你最好在朋友和家人的时候讨论这个问题，而且应该是非常早期的阶段。

I mean I think you don't  want to, like when you're, I think a startup is, like I said, it's hard  right? It's not something you just kind of, it's not as glamorous as one might  think. There's a lot of like grunt work that goes into it, so I think  having a commitment to an idea that you can imagine doing for quite a long  time, like we said, it takes many, many years for a startup to become successful.  I think to me, that's one of the tipping points and to being able to  say to your friends and family, "Hey mom, can I have $10,000?" To be able  to know that you might not, actually in all likelihood you won't give that back  to her, right, so there's got to be enough of a personal commitment, so that's  how I would describe the very first milestone. Maybe you have more thoughts on that  one.

我是说，我觉得你不想，比如当你在创业的时候，我想，就像我说的，这很难，对吧？这不是你想的那样，它不像你想象的那么迷人。这里面有很多类似的工作，所以我认为对一个你可以想象做很长一段时间的想法有一个承诺，就像我们说的，创业要花很多年才能成功。我想，这是一个转折点，我可以对你的朋友和家人说：“嘿，妈妈，我能要1万美元吗？”能够知道你可能不会，实际上你很可能不会把它还给她，对吧，所以必须有足够的个人承诺，所以这就是我要描述的第一个里程碑。也许你对这件事有更多的想法。

Aaron Harris: I think that's exactly right, it's kind of a fuzzy decision point, but it's just  this thing in your head where at some point the balance of evidence says, I  want to work on this for real, full time.

亚伦·哈里斯：我认为这是完全正确的，这是一个模糊的决策点，但这只是你头脑中的事情，在某种程度上，证据的平衡说，我想真正地、全职地处理这个问题。

I'm okay losing mom's or grandma's  or my brother's ten grand or 50 grand. Like that's probably 98 percent chance that's  just going to go poof.

我不介意失去妈妈的，奶奶的，或者我哥哥的一万或者五万。这大概是98%的几率。

If you're okay with that, from like a thought-through perspective  and not just, I mean some people are cavalier with their friends' and family's money,  but if you're okay with that, because you really want to commit to something, I  think that's the time to go do it.

如果你对此没有意见，从深思熟虑的角度来看，我的意思是，有些人对朋友和家人的钱很轻率，但如果你对此没意见，因为你真的想要做点什么，我认为这是时候去做了。

Jess Lee: Yeah.

杰茜·李：是的。

Aaron Harris: Then as your company grows, there become these other things, there are certain milestones and  metrics, you know, if you're building a SAS business, and you get to a million  dollars in ARR and you're growing at something like 20 percent to 30 percent a  month, you might be ready for a Series A, like all this stuff, those are  sometimes right in terms of the next round of financing, but even those are all  like fuzzy lines. You can never look at someone else's experience fundraising and saying ah,  that perfectly ports over to me. So I think it actually plays out forward at  every point in time, there is a balance of evidence that makes you decide that  you are ready. Or that makes someone else decide that you're ready and they come  and hand you a check.

亚伦·哈里斯：那么，随着你的公司的成长，还有其他的事情，有一些里程碑和衡量标准，你知道，如果你正在建立一个SAS业务，你在ARR中获得一百万美元，并且你每月增长大约20%到30%，你可能已经做好了A系列的准备，就像所有这些东西一样，这些在术语上有时是正确的。下一轮融资，但这些都是模糊的线。你永远不能看别人的募款经验，说啊，那对我来说太完美了。所以我认为它在每一个时间点都是向前的，有一个平衡的证据让你决定你已经准备好了。或者让别人决定你准备好了，他们会来给你一张支票。

I think that's what Sequoia, one of the things Sequoia  does really well is they'll lean in on a deal before the founder even realizes  that they're necessarily ready. Just be like, we think you're amazing and ready, we want  to fund you.

我认为这就是红杉，红杉所做的事情之一，就是在创始人意识到他们必须做好准备之前，他们就会依赖于一笔交易。就像，我们认为你已经准备好了，我们想资助你。

Jess Lee: Isn't that what happened to you?
Aaron Harris: It's what happened to us at our seed round, and it's something that's happened to  friends of mine who have been funded later by Sequoia. So anyway, if you are,  get to the point where you're ready to raise money, or have other questions about  it, just email Jess, I think it's jlee@ ...

杰茜·李：你不就是这样吗？亚伦·哈里斯：这是我们在种子回合中发生的事情，也是发生在我朋友身上的事情，他们后来得到了红杉的资助。所以，不管怎么说，如果你准备好筹集资金，或者有其他问题，只要发电子邮件给杰茜，我想是jlee@.

Jess Lee: Jess@SequoiaCap.com.

Jess Lee：Jess@SequoiaCap.com。

Aaron Harris: Jess@SequoiaCap.com.

艾伦·哈里斯：Jess@SequoiaCap.com。

I think we've got time for a few questions in the room. You can  obviously always email me or email Y-C.

我想我们有时间在房间里问几个问题。很明显，你总是可以给我发电子邮件或者发电子邮件Y-C。

I'm Aaron, A-A-R-O-N @Ycombinator.com. Yeah, this takes up  a lot of time, and a lot of thought, and unfortunately it actually, fundraising takes  up a lot more time and thought than it should because it seems like something  that should be systematic, but is actually chaos, which really confuses people, especially people who  are logically brained. Yeah?
Speaker 3: What should the fundraising strategy be? Should it be like 50 companies and approach all  50 of them at the same time, or should we do it over a month  or two? What's the right approach?
Aaron Harris: In terms of running a process?
Speaker 3: Of running the process, yeah.

我是阿伦，A-R-O-N@Yconsiator.com。是的，这需要很多时间，很多思考，但不幸的是，筹款花费了更多的时间和思考，因为它看起来应该是系统性的，但实际上是混乱的，这真的让人困惑，尤其是那些有逻辑头脑的人。嗯演讲者3：筹资策略应该是什么？我们应该像50家公司一样，同时接触所有50家公司，还是应该在一两个月内这样做？什么是正确的方法？亚伦·哈里斯：在运行过程方面？主持人3：运行过程，是的。

Speaker 4: Can you repeat the question?
Aaron Harris: Yeah, so the question was what's the right way to run a process in terms  of reaching out to firms or individuals? If you have a list of 50, do  you do it sequentially or in parallel, basically.

演讲者4：你能重复这个问题吗？亚伦·哈里斯：是的，那么问题是，从接触公司或个人的角度来看，怎样才是正确的方法来运作一个过程呢？如果你有一个50的列表，你是顺序地还是并行的，基本上。

I would say do it in parallel.  Like, everyone to the starting gate at the same time, because one of the things  you want to create the competitive dynamic, and the best way to create a competitive  dynamic is to have a lot of people trying to do the same thing at  once. Right, so you want a narrow gate with a lot of people trying to  push through it. The only situation in which that isn't true, if you have like  a super friendly investor who you know really well, and you think you can get  them to jump the gun, and you can like sort of threaten them, and say  like, "Ah, you know, I'm about to go out and talk to a lot of  people, but I'd rather not spend the effort building a deck," and if you can  trigger them to jump in, it works sometimes if you're good enough at playing it,  but that's really hard. That's like next-level stuff. Yeah, in the back.

我要说的是并行处理。就像，每个人同时来到起点，因为你想要创造竞争动力的一件事，而创造竞争动力的最好方法就是让很多人同时做同样的事情。对，所以你想要一扇狭窄的门，里面有很多人试图推开它。唯一的情况不是这样，如果你有一个超级友好的投资者，你非常了解，你认为你可以让他们跳过枪，你可以像威胁他们，说：“啊，你知道，我要出去和很多人交谈，但我不想花精力去建设。一副牌，“如果你能让他们跳进去，如果你打得够好的话，它有时会起作用，但这真的很难。”就像下一级的东西。是的，在后面。

Speaker 5: The question, so you mentioned that angel investors are a shorter time frame and sort  of the Series A and Series B investors are a longer time frame. On the  topic of process, you know, if you were going after Series A, or your angel,  like how many more meetings or what kind of time frame do you think it  takes from when you decide to start that process to when you might expect to  have a result?
Aaron Harris: Yeah, so let me repeat the question then you take it. So the question is  what is the he timeline, and what is the process for different stages of investing  from the investor's perspective?
Jess Lee: I would say I wouldn't think about it just as angel versus firm.

演讲者5：问题，所以你提到天使投资者是一个更短的时间框架，而系列A和B系列投资者是一个更长的时间框架。关于过程这个话题，你知道，如果你是在追求A系列，或者你的天使，比如，你认为还需要多少次会议，或者你认为需要什么样的时间框架，从你决定开始这个过程，到你可能期望有结果的时候？亚伦·哈里斯：是的，让我重复这个问题，然后你再回答。所以问题是，从投资者的角度来看，投资的不同阶段的过程是什么？杰茜·李：我要说的是，我不会把它仅仅看作是天使和坚定。

I would  think maybe a little buit about how much you're trying to raise. Like if you're  trying to raise a $250,000 or $750,000 round, and you're mostly talking to individuals and  angels, then like he said it can often be just a conversation. A slide deck  helps but doesn't always have to happen. When you're getting to seed, so maybe like  anywhere from, I don't know, one to two and a half, then you can expect  both from like the micro-VC's as well as like the sand hill road investors. Probably  one or two meetings, right, and that can happen within a week, like for us  it could definitely be within a week. Or just two meetings.

我觉得你想要筹集多少。比如，如果你试图筹集25万美元或75万美元，而你主要是与个人和天使交谈，那么就像他说的那样，这往往只是一次谈话。一个滑梯板是有帮助的，但并不总是一定要发生的。当你开始创业的时候，也许就像从任何地方一样，我不知道，一到两个半，那么你可以从像微风投和沙山路投资者一样期待两者。可能有一两次会议，对吧，这可以在一周内发生，就像我们肯定在一周之内。或者只开两次会。

I don't know about  you guys. Well I mean your process is completely different now. Then when you get  to an A, then you might probably what will happen with a firm is you  might have one meeting with the first person, a second meeting with multiple partners, and  then the full partner meeting, right? Not every firm requires unanimous, not every firm requires  that everyone sees it, but that also tells you a little bit about how that  firm is run, is it more of a team sport of an individual sport kind  of firm? So that's what I would say would be the cadence, and then it's  really just about scheduling, like can you get those three meetings done in a week,  two weeks? Great firms will be able to move fast, though.

我不知道你们怎么了。我是说你现在的过程完全不同了。然后当你拿到A的时候，你很可能会遇到一个公司，你可能会和第一个人见面，和多个合伙人见面，然后是正式的合伙人会议，对吧？并不是每一家公司都要求一致，也不是每一家公司都要求每个人都看到它，但这也告诉了你该公司是如何运作的，这更像是一个个体体育公司的团队运动吗？这就是我想说的节奏，然后是关于日程安排，比如你能在一周，两周内完成这三次会议吗？不过，伟大的公司将能够迅速行动。

Aaron Harris: Yeah, and you will be amazed at how far timelines can compress in a hot  deal, and how long they can stretch out in a cold one. One of the  really interesting things is, if you think about the incentive dynamic for an investor, it  is in their best interest to wait as long as possible before making a decision  if they can, because they just gather more and more evidence. So but as a  founder, that's bad for you. So you have to juggle those things. One more? One  more. Any other questions? Awesome, you all know how to fundraise. That's great. Thank you  so much.

亚伦·哈里斯：是的，你会惊讶于时间线在热交易中能压缩到多远，在寒冷的交易中能延伸多长时间。其中一件非常有趣的事情是，如果你考虑到投资者的激励动力，在他们能够做出决定之前尽可能长时间等待是符合他们的最大利益的，因为他们只是收集了越来越多的证据。但作为创办人，这对你不好。所以你得摆弄那些东西。再来一个。再来一个。还有其他问题吗？太棒了，你们都知道怎么筹款。太好了太感谢你了。

Jess Lee: Thanks, guys.

杰西·李：谢谢，伙计们。

Ali Rowghani: All right, I think I'm the last person between now and lunch and now and  maybe this summer, right? Summer exams. So I'll try to be quick. My name is  Ari Reggani. The subject of my talk is how to succeed long term, and I've  been amazed, I was watching some of the videos that you guys saw and reading  up on some of the notes. You guys have heard from some amazing people. Emmitt  Sheer and Michael Sybol and Erin Levy, et cetera, talking about how to build a  great product, and Adam DeAngelo and Stuart Butterfield about how to come up with ideas  and measure success, Peter Reinhardt about product market fit, Benod Cosla about hiring and building  teams, it's an incredible list of people, and now from Jess and Aaron about the  tactics of fundraising.

阿里·罗哈尼：好吧，我想我是从现在到午餐，现在到今年夏天最后一个人，对吧？暑期考试。所以我试着快点。我叫阿里·雷加尼。我演讲的主题是如何从长远来看取得成功，我很惊讶，我看了你们看到的一些视频，并阅读了一些笔记。你们听过一些了不起的人的消息。埃米特·谢尔和迈克尔·塞波、艾琳·利维等人谈论如何打造一个伟大的产品，亚当·德安杰洛和斯图尔特·巴特菲尔德谈到如何提出想法和衡量成功，彼得·莱因哈特关于产品市场适合，贝诺德·科斯拉谈到雇佣和组建团队，这是一份令人难以置信的名单，现在杰斯和亚伦都在谈论筹资策略。

I'm here to talk about a topic that's perhaps more slippery and  abstract than any of the topics you guys have heard about so far. That topic  is leadership.

我在这里谈论的话题可能比你们听说过的任何一个话题都要棘手和抽象。这个话题就是领导力。

In particular, I wanted to answer the following question: what do you have  to do to be a great leader? Hopefully it goes without saying that learning to  be a great leader is pretty fundamental to long term success, and the reason's pretty  simple.

特别是，我想回答以下问题：要成为一个伟大的领导者，你必须做些什么？希望毫无疑问，学习成为一名伟大的领导者对于长期的成功来说是非常重要的，原因也很简单。

If you're going to succeed in building a really successful startup, there's really no  way around having to hire a lot of people and motivating and aligning them and  getting to achieve something much bigger than you could ever achieve on your own. So  there's really kind of no way around learning how to be a great leader if  you want to succeed. For me, the question really starts, the most important initial question  to ask is the following: when you study leaders, are great leaders largely similar to  one another, or are they really different? I remember when I was sitting at Stanford,  I was an undergrad and a business school student here, and I remember sitting in  business school, and if you'd asked me that question, I would have said pretty clearly  that I think there's kind of a single personality trait. Like, leaders are all pretty  much the same. Either you have those genes or that sort of leadership mojo or  if you didn't, then you better kind of work on changing your personality traits around  so you could exhibit some of those leadership personality traits so you could be a  leader. This question for me was largely an academic one, until after business school I  started working at Pixar, the animation studio, and had the extreme good fortune of working  with four people, four leaders that I consider extraordinary, and these four people were Steve  Jobs, who was our CEO, Ed Catmull who was Pixar's founder, and was the president  of Pixar when I joined, John Lassiter, who was Pixar's chief creative officer, and Bob  Eiger who is the CEO of Disney who acquired Pixar in 2006. The surprising thing  for me about working with these leaders was that they couldn't have been more different  in terms of their personality, their temperament, their style, and really just the way they  went about doing their jobs.

如果你要成功地创建一家真正成功的创业公司，就没有办法去雇佣大量的员工，激励他们，让他们团结起来，并取得比你自己能够实现的更大的成就。所以，如果你想要成功，学习如何成为一个伟大的领导者是没有办法的。对我来说，这个问题真的开始了，首先要问的最重要的问题是：当你研究领导者时，伟大的领导者在很大程度上是相似的，还是真的不同？我记得当我坐在斯坦福大学的时候，我是一个大学毕业生和一个商学院的学生，我记得我坐在商学院，如果你问我这个问题，我会很清楚地说，我认为这是一种单一的性格特征。就像，领导者们都是一样的。你要么有这些基因，要么就是那种领导方式，或者如果你没有，那么你最好努力改变你的性格特征，这样你就可以展示一些领导力的个性特征，这样你就可以成为一个领导者。对我来说，这个问题很大程度上是一个学术性的问题，直到商学院毕业后，我开始在皮克斯动画工作室工作，非常幸运的是，我和四个人一起工作，四个我认为是非凡的领导者，这四个人是史蒂夫·乔布斯，他是我们的首席执行官，埃德·卡特莫尔，皮克斯的创始人，也是皮克斯公司的总裁，当我加入约翰·拉斯特时，他是皮克斯的首席创意官，鲍勃·埃格尔是迪斯尼的首席执行官，他在2006年收购了皮克斯。和这些领导一起工作让我感到惊讶的是，他们在个性、气质、风格以及真正的工作方式上都大相径庭。

I want to tell you a little bit about each  one of them with the aid of a picture. That's John Lassiter. John was and  is an extroverted artist. He studied cartoons, he went to animation school, he's boisterous and  fun loving, he loves toys, and he has a massive toy collection, you can see  part of that behind him. He's emotional, he's energetic, you could always read how he  felt on his face, he loves wine and good food, he had dozens of hobbies  outside of work. He didn't manage his time particularly well, and was always over committed,  and he always showed people a lot of love, the people around him. He gave  everyone hugs, and he wore Hawaiian shirts every day. Ed Catmull on the other hand,  was an introverted scientist. He had a PhD. He studied computer graphics at University of  Utah and graduated in 1974 with a dream to one day make an animated film  on a computer. He was quiet, thoughtful, exceptionally calm, never reactive, he was hard to  read and decipher, he was really health conscious. He kind of lived his life the  right way. He didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he ate well, and his primary hobby  outside of work believe it or not, was to go on week long silent meditation  retreats. You guys all know about Steve. He was a college dropout. He'd never really  worked for anyone in his life. He was a magnetic presence in meetings, walking around.  He was intense, he was impatient, he was extraordinarily quick on his feet, he was  not really prone to bonding with people or showing love or affection. Certainly I never  saw him give anyone a hug at work. He could say really pointed things, he  was aggressive, he was always in a hurry, and he was in a hurry to  get to the answer. He had this energy about him, and a clarity of thought  and communication that was really remarkable. Then finally Bob Eiger. Bob was the CEO of  Disney. He had, unlike Steve, spent more than 30 years at the same company before  he eventually became the CEO. He was diplomatic, he was genteel, he was patient, wise,  calm, he had gravitas. He exuded a trustworthiness and honor that you wanted to be  around and follow, and he had really, really high emotional intelligence. Here's a picture of  the four of them on the day we announced Disney's acquisition of Pixar. When I  look at this picture, I think to myself, these four guys worked extremely well together,  and if they'd met each other in high school or in college, there's no way  they would have ever been friends. You had an artist and a scientist, a hippie  and an athlete, and they just would not have run in the same circles. So  working with these guys taught me a lot, and it kind of led me to  my personal first insight about leadership, which is that there's no single personality type for  great leaders. There's really no single model. This is actually really great news if you  think about it, because it means that people of varying personality types can all strive  to be great leaders. There's not a gene set or a certain personality type that  allows you to be a great leader or disqualifies you from being a leader. But  the other implication of this insight is that in your quest to become a leader  of your startup, or even a bigger aspiration for leadership, you have to be yourself.  You have to be authentic. You can't try to be someone else or copy someone  else's personality or style and hope to be a great leader. You can't try to  be like Steve Jobs. The reason for that is that as humans, we're actually really  highly evolved at detecting inauthenticity in other people. We don't follow people we find to  be inauthentic. So this kind of leads to my second isnight that I wanted to  share, which is despite the variability in personalities, despite the fact that really all personality  types can be great leaders, all great leaders have to do three things exceptionally well.  The first is that great leaders think and communicate clearly. As a leader, you have  to paint a compelling vision for the future that other people can understand and follow.  This is the case if you're a three person startup and you're trying to motivate  your co-founders or early employees, and it's even more the case when you're a 100-person  company, a 1000-person company, and so on. The key thing about communication as a leaders  it that simplicity of communication is vital.

我想用一张照片告诉你们每个人的一些情况。那是约翰·拉西特。约翰过去是，现在也是个外向的艺术家。他学习动画片，他上动画学校，他狂躁而有趣，他喜欢玩具，他有一个庞大的玩具收藏，你可以看到他背后的一部分。他情绪化，精力充沛，你总能读到他脸上的感受，他喜欢葡萄酒和美食，他在工作之外有很多爱好。他没有很好地利用自己的时间，总是过度投入，他总是给人们很多的爱，他周围的人。他给每个人拥抱，他每天都穿夏威夷衬衫。另一方面，艾德·卡特莫尔是一位内向的科学家。他有博士学位。他在犹他州大学学习计算机图形学，1974年毕业，梦想有一天能在电脑上制作一部动画电影。他安静，深思，异常平静，从不反应，他很难阅读和解读，他是真正的健康意识。他的生活方式是正确的。他不喝酒，不抽烟，吃得很好，除了工作之外，他的主要爱好是参加一周的静坐静修。你们都知道史蒂夫的事。他是个大学辍学生。他一生中从未真正为任何人工作过。他在会议上很有魅力，四处走动。他很紧张，很不耐烦，他站起来特别快，他不太容易与人亲近，也不喜欢表达爱或爱意。当然，我从没见过他在工作中给任何人一个拥抱。他能说出非常尖锐的话，他很有侵略性，他总是很匆忙，而且他急于找到答案。他有这种能量，清晰的思想和沟通，这是非常了不起的。最后鲍勃·艾格。鲍勃是迪斯尼的首席执行官。与史蒂夫不同，他在同一家公司工作了30多年，后来才成为首席执行官。他是个外交家，彬彬有礼，有耐心，聪明，冷静，有庄重。他散发出一种值得信赖和尊敬的东西，你想和他在一起，跟随他，他有非常高的情商。这是我们宣布迪斯尼收购皮克斯的那一天他们四个人的照片。当我看着这张照片时，我想，这四个人在一起工作得非常好，如果他们在高中或大学里相遇，他们就不可能成为朋友。你有一个艺术家和一个科学家，一个嬉皮士和一个运动员，他们就不会在同一个圈子里跑了。所以和这些人一起工作让我学到了很多，这让我开始了对领导力的第一次洞察力，那就是伟大的领导者没有单一的个性类型。真的没有单一的模式。如果你想一想，这实际上是个好消息，因为这意味着不同性格类型的人都可以努力成为伟大的领导者。没有一种基因或某种人格类型可以让你成为一个伟大的领导者，或者让你失去成为领导者的资格。但这一观点的另一个含义是，当你想成为创业公司的领导者，甚至是对领导力的更大渴望时，你必须做好自己。你必须是真实的。你不能试图成为别人或模仿别人的个性或风格，并希望成为一个伟大的领导者。你不能试着像史蒂夫·乔布斯那样。其原因是，作为人类，我们实际上在发现其他人的不真实性方面是高度进化的。我们不会跟踪那些被我们发现是不真实的人。这导致了我想要分享的第二个夜晚，尽管性格的多变性，尽管事实上所有的性格类型都可以成为伟大的领导者，但所有伟大的领导者都必须做好三件事。第一，伟大的领导人能清晰地思考和交流。作为一名领导者，你必须为未来描绘一个其他人能够理解和遵循的引人注目的愿景。如果你是一家三人创业公司，你试图激励你的联合创始人或早期员工，情况就会如此，而当你是一家100人的公司，一家1000人的公司，等等。作为领导者，沟通的关键在于简单的沟通是至关重要的。

I remember marveling at Steve Jobs' ability at  Pixar to take the most complicated problem we were discussing, and be able to simplify  it to its core essence, break something complicated apart into what really mattered, and how  we should approach something first, second, third.

我记得史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)在皮克斯(Pixar)的能力让我惊叹不已，他能够解决我们讨论过的最复杂的问题，并能够将其简化为核心问题，将复杂的事情分解成真正重要的东西，以及我们应该如何首先、第二、第三次处理问题。

It was like we were all sitting in  darkness, and there was one guy who had a lantern, and that was Steve. Because  of that because he had clarity and could explain something in a way that you  could understand and sounded right, you would follow him. The other example I love on  simplicity is an example from Jeff Bezos of Amazon. He once said that in Amazon's  retail business, which now encompasses almost every category, if not every category of products on  earth, he said only three things mattered. First, low prices. Second, broad selection, and third,  fast delivery. These three things were the only things that consumers cared about, and they  would always care about those three things, so anything that an Amazon employee would do  to improve Amazon's performance in those three areas, was aligned with Amazon's strategy. That simplicity  has been there, the bedrock of Amazon's retial strategy from the beginning. That's great communication.  Now obviously, Bezos and Jobs set a pretty high bar, and I'm not here to  try to teach you to be any of those guys. But I can tell you  that if you want to improve as a communicator, the first thing you should do  is to step back and give yourself more time to think. Even Steve Jobs used  to tell us that when he was at his best, running both Apple and Pixar,  half of his time, half of his schedule was unscheduled, meaning it wasn't filled with  meetings with other people. He created time in his calendar to be able to think.  That's going to be really hard when you guys start your startups.

就像我们都坐在黑暗中，有一个人拿着灯笼，那就是史蒂夫。正因为如此，因为他很清晰，可以用一种你能理解和听得对的方式来解释一些事情，所以你会跟随他。我喜欢简单的另一个例子来自Amazon的JeffBezos。他曾经说过，亚马逊的零售业务现在几乎涵盖了所有类别，如果不是地球上每一类产品的话，他说只有三件事是重要的。第一，价格低。第二，选择广泛，第三，快速交货。这三件事是消费者唯一关心的事情，他们总是关心这三件事，所以亚马逊员工为改善亚马逊在这三个领域的表现所做的任何事情都与亚马逊的战略相一致。这种简单性从一开始就是亚马逊退休战略的基石。很好的交流。很明显，贝佐斯和乔布斯设定了一个很高的标准，我来这里不是想教你成为这些人中的任何一个。但我可以告诉你，如果你想提高作为一个沟通者，你应该做的第一件事是退一步，给自己更多的时间思考。就连史蒂夫·乔布斯(SteveJobs)也曾告诉我们，当他处于最佳状态时，他一半的时间和一半的时间都在运行着苹果和皮克斯(Pixar)，这意味着他没有和其他人开会。他在日历上创造了时间来思考。当你们开始创业的时候，这将是非常困难的。

It's going to  be frenetic, you're going to be pulled in a million directions, and it's going to  be very, very difficult to actually devote time to just thinking.

这将是疯狂的，你将被拉向千万个方向，这将是非常困难的，实际上花时间去思考。

I don't mean answering  email.

我不是说回复邮件。

I mean time to think and plan ahead. Plan your communication. What are you  going to say? How are you going to explain what you think in a clear  way? So my best advice on this is force yourself to take as little as  an hour a day, or an hour every other day at the beginning, and try  to grow that amount of time on your calendar that you're devoted just to thinking.  Go for a walk. Sit at your desk. Whatever you do that helps you get  clarity, take that time. You can get better at communication. Some people have natural gifts,  but anyone with practice and with giving themselves time to think can get better, and  the core insight here is that clarity of thought always proceeds clarity of language. Second  thing all great leaders do is they show great judgment about people. So you heard  Benod Cosla a few weeks ago say that the first ten people you hire into  your startup are absolutely critical, and he's right. When you grow your startup, you have  to have great judgment, not only about the people you hire into sort of individual  contributor roles, but even more so, the people to whom you decide to give authority  and power. The people you decide to promote, and to make managers, and to make  into leaders.

我的意思是有时间去思考和计划未来。计划你的沟通。你想说什么？你要怎么清楚地解释你的想法？因此，我对此最好的建议是，强迫自己一天少花一个小时，或者在一开始每隔一天花一个小时，试着在日历上增加你专注于思考的时间。去散步坐在你的办公桌前。不管你做什么都能帮你弄清楚，花点时间。你可以更善于沟通。有些人有天生的天赋，但任何有实践经验并给自己时间思考的人都会变得更好，而这里的核心观点是，思维的清晰总是会促进语言的清晰化。第二件事，所有伟大的领导者所做的是，他们表现出对人的巨大判断力。几周前，你听到贝诺德·科斯拉说，你雇佣的前十名创业人员是绝对关键的，他是对的。当你成长你的创业公司时，你必须有很好的判断力，不仅是关于你雇佣的人成为某种个人的贡献者，更重要的是，你决定给予他们权力和权力的人。你决定提拔的人，成为管理者的人，以及成为领导者的人。

If you show bad judgment there, if you pick the wrong people, if  you bring the wrong people into your company, you can never grow into a great  leader. Like communication, you can actually improve and develop your intuition about people. Practice and  experience again help here. So as you guys start your companies, many of you will  likely be hiring people for the first time, and so here's my advice: don't rush  it. Take the time to get to know the people you're hiring.

如果你表现出错误的判断力，如果你选择了错误的人，如果你把错误的人带入你的公司，你就永远不会成为一个伟大的领导者。就像交流一样，你可以提高和发展你对人的直觉。练习和经验再次帮助这里。所以，当你们开始创业的时候，你们中的很多人可能会第一次雇佣员工，所以我的建议是：不要着急。花点时间去了解你要招聘的人。

Ideally, start with  co-founders and early employees who you already know.

理想的情况是，从你已经认识的联合创始人和早期员工开始。

It's important to be aligned from a  values perspective.

重要的是要从价值观的角度对齐。

It's not just can this person code, or can this person get a  job accomplished, you want to try to hire people of the long term. Spend time  to get to know them. You know, it's not unusual for people at larger startups  are hiring their first members of leadership, that they spent ten, 20, 30 hours with  the person before they decide to hire them. So spending time to get to know  someone is very, very important, and trying to bond with them on values, like what  do they really care about? Are you guys aligned, do you think you can get  along well in the long term? Evaluate that as well as their competence. The second  thing that's very important in developing your intuition is try to meet people who are  absolutely great at what they do, even if you can't hire them, in order to  develop your own understanding of what great is. Again, I could give you lots of  examples of founders who spent a lot of time doing this. But the more people  you meet, the more great people you meet, you fine tune your ability to detect  those characteristics in other people. Finally, a lot of hires don't work out, no matter  how well you do it. You're going to have to change people out, you're going  to have to ask people to leave, make sure you do that quickly. Make sure  you're courageous about it, and make sure that you reflect on the lessons learned every  time someone doesn't work out, and also every time someone works out. Make sure you're  reflective about your own process and how you've decided to bring people into the company,  and who you decide to promote into more bigger leadership roles. Last insight, great leaders  have exceptional personal integrity and commitment.

不只是这个人能编码，或者这个人能完成一项工作，你想要试着雇佣长期的人。花点时间去了解他们。你知道，在规模较大的初创公司招聘第一批领导成员时，他们花了10、20、30个小时才决定聘用他们，这并不罕见。所以花时间去了解一个人是非常重要的，并且试图与他们建立价值观上的联系，比如他们真正关心的是什么？你们是一致的吗，你们认为你们能长期相处得很好吗？评估这一点以及他们的能力。第二件事在发展你的直觉中非常重要，那就是试着去遇到那些在工作上绝对优秀的人，即使你不能雇用他们，这样你就能对什么是伟大的东西有自己的理解。再一次，我可以给大家举很多创始人的例子，他们花了很多时间来做这件事。但是你遇到的人越多，你就会调整你的能力，去发现其他人的这些特征。最后，不管你做得有多好，很多员工都不会成功。你将不得不改变人们，你将不得不要求人们离开，确保你做的很快。确保你在这方面是勇敢的，并确保每次有人不锻炼的时候，你都会反思自己学到的经验教训，而且每次有人锻炼的时候，你也要认真思考。确保你在反思自己的过程，以及你如何决定让员工进入公司，以及你决定提拔谁担任更大的领导角色。最后的洞察力，伟大的领导者有非凡的个人正直和承诺。

Integrity means standing for something that's important, bigger than  yourself.

正直意味着代表重要的东西，比你自己更重要的东西。

It means having a mission to accomplish that is much greater than your own  personal wealth or fame.

这意味着有一项比你个人的财富或名誉更重要的使命去完成这一使命。

It means avoiding behavior that would erode trust in all of  us, things like favoritism or conflicts of interest or using inappropriate language, or having inappropriate  work relationships. They key test for me is if you consider if all of your  communications, all of your emails, all of your verbal communications that you have with those  around you, if they were all transparent to everyone, wold you be embarrassed by anything  you've done or said? Really you should try to hold yourself to that bar. Commitment  means making your work, making your startup into a life mission in a way that  inspires other people.

这意味着要避免那些会损害对我们所有人的信任的行为，比如偏袒或利益冲突，使用不恰当的语言，或有不适当的工作关系。他们对我的关键考验是，你是否考虑到，你与身边的人的所有沟通、邮件、口头交流是否都是透明的，你会不会为你做过或说过的任何事情感到尴尬？你真该试着守在那间酒吧里。承诺意味着使你的工作，使你的创业成为一种生活使命，以一种激励他人的方式。

It means giving it your all. That's inspiring, when people see others,  when people see leaders motivated by a big purpose and giving it their all to  accomplish that purpose, it's motivating in and of itself. When you think of the opposite,  when you see someone who is motivated by selfish ends, who si cutting corners, who  is slacking off, who is showing ethical weakness, those are not people you want to  follow. So if you want to be a great leader, it's really important to hold  yourself to this bar. So I wanted to leave you guys with the last insight  I have and a piece of parting advice. Ultimately, if you want to measure a  great leader by one thing, I think the most important success metric for a leader  is trust. Trust is a squishy concept, and in the way I'm using it, I  mean it almost in a 360 degree sense. The job of every leader is to  build trust.

这意味着你要全力以赴。这是鼓舞人心的，当人们看到别人，当人们看到领导者被一个伟大的目标所激励，并全力以赴去完成这个目标时，它本身就是激励。当你想到相反的情况时，当你看到一个被自私的目的所驱使的人，一个偷工减料的人，一个表现出道德弱点的人，他们不是你想要追随的人。所以，如果你想成为一个伟大的领导者，坚持自己的立场是非常重要的。所以我想给你们留下我最后的洞察力和临别的建议。最终，如果你想用一件事来衡量一个伟大的领导者，我认为对一个领导者来说最重要的成功标准就是信任。信任是一个模糊的概念，在我所使用的方式中，我的意思是它几乎在360度的意义上。每个领导人的工作都是建立信任。

Is to build trust in employees, in investors, in customers, in users, and  building trust is both an art and a science. The science part of it's fairly  easy.

是建立对员工、投资者、客户、用户的信任，而建立信任既是一门艺术，也是一门科学。其中的科学部分相当容易。

It means when there's an empirical question to answer, when you have to think  through what is the technology we should build, or the product direction we should go  in or what sort of partnership we should strike in the marketplace, like you've got  to be right about those things a lot, right? It's a question of competence.

这意味着，当有一个经验性的问题要回答的时候，当你必须思考我们应该建立什么样的技术，我们应该进入什么样的产品方向，或者我们应该在市场上达成什么样的合作关系，就像你在这些事情上很多时候都是正确的一样，对吧？这是一个能力问题。

It's  also a question of competence when it comes to your people judgment. Are you good  at people choices you make, both hiring and promotion? The art of trust is more  difficult.

当涉及到你的人民的判断时，这也是一个能力问题。你擅长于你所做的人的选择，无论是招聘还是晋升？信任的艺术更加困难。

It's about showing empathy, having good timing, choosing the right words, dealing with different  people in the right ways, and it's about the integrity and commitment that I mentioned,  striving for something bigger than yourself, rather than being selfish or self-centered. When you see  a leader who has incredible trust, think about in your personal life, the people you  follow in your life, whether it's your friends or family members, et cetera, think about  who you have the deepest level of trust for in your life, maybe outside of  your parents.

这是要表现出同理心，有好的时机，选择正确的语言，以正确的方式与不同的人打交道，这关系到我提到的正直和承诺，追求比你自己更重要的东西，而不是自私或以自我为中心。当你看到一个拥有难以置信的信任的领导者，想想你的个人生活，你生活中跟随的人，不管是你的朋友还是家人，等等，想想你一生中最信任的人，也许是你父母之外的人。

It's likely that those same people are people you would listen to and  follow, because trust is such a strong bond. So here's my parting advice: at every  step as you guys move forward, build your startups, may succeed, it may fail, you'll  try it again, et cetera, you're going to have hard times, and hopefully good times.  Always try to optimize for trust. You're going to have a lot of hard decisions  to make, if you scale a startup, you're going to have to fire people, you're  going to have to admit mistakes to your employees and to your customers, you're going  to have to say no to people because you disagree with their ideas. Try to  view every challenge you guys face as leaders as an opportunity to increase the trust  that people have in you. Always as you're evaluating one course of action versus another,  my best advice is to ask yourself, which path will generate more trust in you  as a leader, and always try to choose that path. Thank you very much, and  I'm happy to take questions. Yes?
Speaker 7: Did Steve ever mention where he learned how to communicate so clearly? Or is it  just a natural talent?
Ali Rowghani: Steve as you guys know, started off very early as and entrepreneur, and there is  a great interview of him if you guys haven't watched it with Steve Jobs and  Bill Gates together, and one of the things that Steve talks about, he said one  of the things that Bill and I have in common is we were always very  early on the youngest people in the room, and how hard that was, and sort  of what a trial by fire that was to try to, as the youngest person  in the room, convince other people that you're right. So I think in his case,  he had years and years of practice before I ever met him.

这些人很可能是你会倾听和追随的人，因为信任是一种很强的纽带。所以我的临别建议是：在你们前进的每一步，建立你们的创业公司，可能会成功，可能会失败，你们会再次尝试，等等，你们将会经历艰难的时期，希望是美好的时光。总是试图优化信任。你会有很多艰难的决定要做，如果你扩大一家公司的规模，你将不得不解雇员工，你必须向你的员工和你的客户承认错误，你将不得不对人们说不，因为你不同意他们的想法。试着把你们面临的每一个挑战都看作是一个机会来增加人们对你的信任。当你评估一条路线和另一条路线的时候，我最好的建议是问问自己，哪条路会让你更信任作为领导者的你，并且总是尝试选择这条路。非常感谢，我很乐意回答你的问题。是主持人7：史蒂夫有没有提到过他在哪里学会了如何如此清晰地沟通？还是天生的天赋？阿里·罗哈尼：大家都知道，史蒂夫很早就开始创业了，如果你们没有和史蒂夫·乔布斯和比尔·盖茨一起看过，他会接受一次很棒的采访。史蒂夫谈到的其中一件事，他说的是，比尔和我的共同点之一就是，我们总是在最年轻的时候房间里的人，这有多难，有多难啊，想要作为房间里最年轻的人，让其他人相信你是对的。所以我觉得在他的案子里，他在我遇到他之前就已经练习了很多年了。

I don't know  if he had any particular techniques, I mean I'm sure a lot of these gifts  came naturally, but practice definitely helps, and being around people with self awareness to realize  that they've made a mistake. Should we take one more? Yes.

我不知道他是否有什么特别的技巧，我的意思是，我相信很多这些天赋都是天生的，但练习肯定会有帮助，并且和有自我意识的人在一起，让他们意识到自己犯了错误。我们再吃一杯好吗？是

Speaker 9: Did you see a different driver behind those four people's motivations?
Ali Rowghani: Oh yeah, for sure.

演讲者9：你有没有看到这四个人的动机背后有不同的司机？阿里·罗哈尼：哦，是的，当然。

Speaker 9: what were those?
Ali Rowghani: Well it's hard for me to speculate. Well I'll just talk about John and Ed,  because I know them the best. John was motivated I think first and foremost by  making great films that brought families together, and would last forever. He used to say  that what other film other than Snow White can anyone name that was made in  1937? I hope I got the year right. But it was in the '30s. He  said if we do our jobs well, these films will live forever. He was also  motivated frankly by just like having fun doing what he did. That guy really squeezed  all the joy you could out of life, and I think those are probably his,  from my observation, some of his biggest motivators.

演讲者9：那是什么？阿里·罗哈尼：嗯，我很难推测。我只想谈谈约翰和艾德，因为我最了解他们。约翰的动机，我认为，首先是制作伟大的电影，把家庭团结在一起，并将持续到永远。他曾经说过，除了“白雪公主”以外，还有什么电影能叫出1937年的电影名称呢？我希望我今年做得对。但那是在30年代。他说，如果我们把工作做好，这些电影就会永垂不朽。坦率地说，他的动机也是因为做他所做的事很开心。他真的把生活中所有的快乐都压缩了，我认为，从我的观察来看，这些可能是他最大的动力之一。

In Ed's case, I think Ed is  a great learner and a thinker.

在艾德的例子中，我认为艾德是一个伟大的学习者和思想家。

I think what motivated him was trying to create  an organization that could repeatedly be successful, repeatedly produce great films, and he kind of  became an organizational thinker. He of course also wanted to make great films, and he  was also a technologist, so he cared a lot about the software we were building.  But I think fundamentally he wanted to try to figure out how to make Pixar  almost impossible, to continue its almost impossible streak of creative success, build an organization that's  able to be repeatedly successful and understand why and how that was. But yeah, the  motivations did differ.

我认为他的动机是试图创建一个能够反复成功的组织，不断地制作伟大的电影，他成为了一名组织思想家。他当然也想拍出伟大的电影，他也是一名技术专家，所以他非常关心我们正在开发的软件。但我认为，从根本上说，他想找出如何使皮克斯几乎不可能，继续其几乎不可能的创造性成功，建立一个能够反复成功的组织，并理解为什么和如何做到这一点。但是的，动机不同。

I think there was definitely some shared values, some shared aspirations, but  each of them had a different specific motivator. Yeah?
Speaker 10: You mentioned that if you looked at the picture, if they were in high school  they most likely wouldn't hang out together, so we're kind of like in the earlier  stage of things, so it's almost like high school, and in the future they wound  up together, they're on their own get together, how can you tell 'em like balance  getting people of diverse backgrounds like that together?
Ali Rowghani: Well I would say you shouldn't do that when you're an early startup. You should  hire people that can first of all that you're connected with and you can work  with well and you think you can get the job done. The


我认为肯定有一些共同的价值观，一些共同的愿望，但每一个都有不同的具体动机。嗯演讲者10：你说过，如果你看照片，如果他们在高中，他们很可能不会在一起，所以我们有点像在早期的事情，所以这几乎就像高中，在未来他们结束在一起，他们独自在一起，你怎么能告诉他们，就像让不同背景的人在一起一样？阿里·罗哈尼：我想说，你在创业初期就不应该这么做。你应该雇佣那些首先可以与你有联系的人，你可以很好地工作，你认为你能完成工作。这，这个，那，那个
