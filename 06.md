#　How to Build a Product III

Speaker 1: Good afternoon, everybody. Today we're going to do a session on B2B product. We have  a panel. Jason Lemkin is going to moderate, thank you very much. We have Solomon  from Docker, Tracy from PlanGrid, and Harry from Lob. Thank you all very much for  coming.
Jason Lemkin: So, this is a great session. Everyone's seen all the prior sessions online, right? Raise  your hand if you haven't. All right, good. 100%. They're great. I watched Aaron Levy,  and we had Dustin Moskovitz, and Stewart Butterfield, and others, and what I thought would  be particularly fun since we have three amazing founders here of B2B Companies is to  particularly hone in on the intersection of building great products and revenue, because we all  want to be product visionaries. I certainly did myself. But if you can't sell it  and it's a B2B product, ultimately what's the point of all of it? So, I  want to dig into a couple of stories, both in the early days and a  little bit later, to help folks like you who probably just have inklings of how  to potentially monetize your dreams, because the stories are always different than we think. So,  let me give 10 seconds on each of the panelists and let me have them  dig in a little big more on their companies. Solomon, from Docker, I don't know  who here knows about Docker, but I see most of the 300,000 folks online that'll  read it, but Docker ... He'll give you some more context ... Founded in 2010,  but not as Docker, as ... What was it called back then?
Solomon: Dotcloud.
Jason Lemkin: Dotcloud, which we'll get to a story. Raised almost 200 million, and Docker is sort  of a foundational piece of infrastructure that everyone builds software on today. So, we'll get  into that, but it is seven years into this journey, right? Into a likely a  seven year journey or fourteen year journey. Tracy, probably is probably in the middle of  this rock star group. PlanGrid was founded a little bit later. 2011?
Tracy: 2011.
Jason Lemkin: Got it. Raised 60 million?
Tracy: Something like that.
Jason Lemkin: Right. So, money isn't everything, but it does help. PlanGrid, you'll all learn, is super  cool, automates construction management and has shaken up a shockingly large industry, shockingly large part  of software. You'll learn a little bit more about those stories. I want to learn  more. Then, Harry runs Lob, which turns mail into an API, which, I think, is  pretty interesting. Raised 10 million, so, he's got another 190 million to catch up on  50 million, but off to a very strong start. Founded in 2013?
Harry: Yes.
Jason Lemkin: So, you're ...  What's that?  All right, so you're four years in, right? So it's just when it's getting both  good and hard, right? At the same time, I would imagine, right? So, I want  to dig in. Those are the intros, but give me a little bit more intro  on the company. Number of employees, and what's the latest challenge you have today, or  any other quick tidbits on the company.
Solomon: Sure, so currently it's 350 employees at Docker. We actually started in 2008.
Jason Lemkin: 2008.
Solomon: Yeah, with bootstraps in France, and it wasn't working so we moved here, got into  YC, and that really, really helped. So, anyway.
Jason Lemkin: Got it.
Solomon: Nine years.
Jason Lemkin: Did you sort of refound the company . You don't count those early years, or  you do?
Solomon: It depends on who you ask, but yeah, it counts, the same company, same problem  we're trying to solve. So, 350 employees, lots of growth, lots of excitement. The biggest  challenge for us, the biggest challenge last year, was proving that we could build a  business, a viable high growth business on top of this excitement for stuff that is,  in large part, free and open source. That was last year. We proved that model,  and this year the challenge is to scale it, and to scale it faster than  our competitors who now have figured out that the model is proven, so there's a  big competitive battle in a really lucrative space. So that's the challenge this year.
Jason Lemkin: Good.
Tracy: Hi, everyone. My name is Tracy Young, I'm one of the co-founders and CEO of  PlanGrid. PlanGrid builds, as you said, beautiful, simple, effective software for the construction industry. We  emerged from Y Combinator's winner of 2012 batch, and since then we've grown from five  co-founders to 310 people, which is not something to brag about. It means our payroll  is very high. We've helped build over 500,000 construction projects, from the smallest kitchen remodels  to the largest projects in the world. We are available on all of the platforms.  Apple actually named us one of the top 10 enterprise apps of 2016, which is  pretty awesome. Now we're also the largest digital blueprint repository in the world. We have  over 50 million sheets of blueprints in our cloud and growing.
Harry: Thanks. I'm sitting here. We've got 40 employees, wishing I had 150. A little bit  about Lob, I'm one of the founders. My name is Harry Zhang. I started the  company in 2013, and what we do is build tools to make it easy for  developers to control the offline world. We actually deal with the physical component, an industry  that many of you think may be dying but in fact is very much the  opposite, dealing with letters, post cards, and other types of mail, and really building a  layer of technology on top of that to make it easy for companies to do  that. Hopefully, many of you have received a piece of mail from Lob, especially in  this area and the Bay Area, and we service companies ... We're trying to make  this switch into selling to mid market and other startups and to selling it to  the Fortune 500. So, a lot of our challenges today is how do we move  into enterprise, and take what used to be a one single tool and translate it  into a larger full solution for larger companies.
Jason Lemkin: Good. Hang on to the microphones because there's just one other question I want to  ask the whole panel. I'd really like to talk about the concept of a minimum  sellable product, not a viable product, what it actually takes to make real money. Harry,  tell me what happened with Lob. Do no count other companies from your batch or  customers you've got off Hacker News. How did you get that first, those first, unaffiliated  customers, and what made the product sellable? Share it.
Harry: Yeah, I think one of the common things that's easy to get in the habit  of thinking that customers are going to come to you because you have a great  product or a great solution. That works, maybe, in the beginning for smaller companies, but  as you go after your first real customer ... Our first real customer was Oscar  Insurance over in New York. So, the way we got to them was cold email,  and we sent thousands and thousands of emails. I, personally, wrote every single one, and  got a response from the CEO. I think one of the key things is to  really have an understanding of why our company is going to talk to you. What  is the problem that you're solving for them as opposed to like, "Here's my product  does, and these are the features that I have." You want to be very pinpoint  about what that message is. People are actually surprisingly open to respond to your email,  as long as it's relevant. For us, we happen to hit on the problem for  Oscar, which is they had a mail vendor. They knew there was this regulation called  HIPAA, which is essentially how you govern and control private health information, and what we  realized was that this was our opportunity. They're looking at new vendors. They did not  trust that their existing vendor had HIPAA and was secured. We could point to a  small customer we'd already done it for in the past. That's how we got into  the conversation. Took us about two or three months to get the deal done, but  really, what you need is to identify a core problem that larger companies haven't quite  figured out, and even if your solution isn't the best that's out there, it needs  to be to a point where the customers are willing to buy. We started off  of one use case, very, very simple explanation of benefits. Today, we send probably 50  different types of mail, checks, postcards, practically everything, but the key is to pick one  small use case that they have a real problem around and that you're going to  go solve. So, that's what we did with Oscar. It's funny, to this date, they're  still one of our larger customers, and it all just came from a three sentence  email to the CEO.
Jason Lemkin: Do you remember what the headline of the email was?
Harry: It was like, "We can help you with your mail."
Jason Lemkin: We can help you with your mail. That worked, huh?
Harry: It did work. We've now learned a lot. That's probably one I'd do today. At  the time, we knew that healthcare sent a lot of mail and we also did  that "You've Got Mail." Which got a pretty good chuckle from folks in the day.  Really, the core of the content that was in the first few lines was just  like, "We know companies have problems sending secure, audible mail, but we built a technology  solution around doing this. Do you have 15 minutes to talk about it?" That's pretty  much what the core content was, but the key is to get straight to the  point. What are you going to solve? What's the problem, and asking for a little  bit more time. I never talked to the CEO, but he punted me down the  chain, but got the right guys eventually.
Jason Lemkin: Tracy, I'm not an expert, but you're probably competing with bigger, traditional, older incumbents in  some ways the mob was. Do I have that wrong? What got you sellable? What  got you really off the ground? Beautiful software is great, but we all want to  build that, right? What made it sellable?
Tracy: Sure, our first 10 users ... I'm trained as a construction engineer, so the first  10 users were definitely people we had worked with in the field. It's easy to  get our friends to try out our software, it's incredibly difficult to get our friends  to start paying for it.
Jason Lemkin: That is a difference.
Tracy: So, building something that they wanted and that they needed that added undeniable value to  their day to day was the moment they started paying us.
Jason Lemkin: Was the feedback from your non paying friends useful? Was it unhelpful? Was it dis-helpful?
Tracy: So, our first beta group, which included mostly people I had worked with in the  field, was about 30 people, 29 of them started paying us as soon as the  beta was over.
Jason Lemkin: They did pay you?
Tracy: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Jason Lemkin: Got it. Okay, so were they bigger critics than outside customers? Sometimes it's hard to  figure out how to take advantage of friends as customers.
Tracy: Yeah, you're really testing my memory. No, at that point, in 2011, 2012, it was  about, "I want this to do more for us. Can you build the XYZ?"
Jason Lemkin: Got it. Obviously the product was feature poor at the time. Right? What was the  one piece that was 10X better?
Tracy: Simply prints are at the core of PlanGrid, replaces physical blueprints. Fold out maps, we  don't have them anymore. Actually, with this group, you guys have probably never purchased a  fold out map before. We use Waze, we use Apple Maps, we use Google Maps,  and with blueprints, it's the same analogy. These massive, incredibly dense pieces of paper with  information, an they just don't render quickly on PDF viewers. It was just
Jason Lemkin: What was the pitch to make your beautiful product sellable? Was it regular 100 times  faster?
Tracy: I'm really glad. I was hoping you'd ask me what the tagline was.
Jason Lemkin: What was the tagline?
Tracy: Our tagline, and this was from my co-founder Kenny, our tagline was PlanGrid eliminates the  bullshit, except that marketing has now changed it. We're the productivity software for construction.
Jason Lemkin: Got it. Okay. Well, we'll dig in more on that. Boy, where do we want  to answer this question. We start hosting applications for others. What's the early history? Tell  us what didn't work, or at least didn't scale, and what did work sellable product.
Solomon: Sure. The background here is, nine years in, we started out as a company called  Dotcloud, and now we're a different company called Docker, but there was a common thread.  It's the same company, the same team with the same mission, but we changed how  we do it. In the first phase as Dotcloud, we ... Well, let me start  with what the common thread is. The common thread is we help developers be more  productive. We give them tools to create applications, and then we help the businesses behind  those developers solve their business problems with the creation of software. We're serving on these  trends of more people creating software to do more things. The first phase, we did  that by hosting the applications. So, we said, "Just write the codes, upload it to  us, we'll take care of everything. We'll run it for you, we'll manage it for  you, all of it." Now, it's Docker. We don't do the hosting. We provide the  tools. You use the tools yourself, and then you host the application, and eventually, as  a business, you need help with various aspects of distributing your software at large scale.  In the first phase, we're very small, we didn't have any sort of hype behind  us. We were just trying to convince developers to use our stuff. Honestly, we used  our own community. We're programmers. We write software, and we know a lot of other  programmers and we just annoyed the hell out of all of them to use our  stuff. We gave it to them for free, and then through the individual programmers, eventually  made our way to the business behind the programmers. The difference, I think, is that,  for us, it's a two-step process. Our users and our biggest advocates are not the  people paying for the product. That means we have to give a lot of stuff  away for free before we even get the first conversation with the actual buyer.
Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Those first early years, it's not even the same product you have today remotely,  right? How did you survive? Did you raise 50 million in your seed round, or  how did you pull this off?
Solomon: No.
Jason Lemkin: Surviving is a hard part, right?
Solomon: When you're a very small team, you have a limited window of time where you  can survive but not a lot.
Jason Lemkin: It's hard, usually, for that to last much more than 24 months, isn't it?
Solomon: That's right. We joined Y Combinator, in 2010, and raised our first small round of  funding at the end of 2010, so within six months. We went at it gradually.  It's nothing particularly unique there.
Jason Lemkin: But you got into YC about 24 months after founding? That was ...
Solomon: Yeah, so the first part was really tough. It was bootstraps. We did consulting, we  did
Jason Lemkin: Consulting was the hack.
Solomon: It was the hack. Whatever we had to do to pay the bills, it was  really tough. My advice would be consulting and product building, they're vary useful, but you  gotta get out of it really quickly because consulting takes all of your time. You  will never get off the ground as a product company. There's too much distraction in  consulting. Eventually we just took a leap of faith and landed on our feet in  Y Combinator.
Jason Lemkin: Got it. One last question and then I want to move on to the next  topic, but what is now Docker has gone through two and a half evolutions as  a business model. You've made open source work for you. What's the secret there? What's  the learning? We think it's hard to monetize open source.
Solomon: Yeah, so honestly, I don't know how useful my insights are here because, really, the  trick is to get really lucky. The situation we're in now is that the open  source technology that we develop, Docker, is extremely popular. We were in the right place  at the right time. There's this whole trend around containers, which we helped start, and  now, just the demand for it is, honestly, hard to describe. You start having a  completely different set of problems once you're in that situation. Honestly, the problems we had  before that moment, in 2013, when we launched the open source Docker and after, are  worlds apart. Now, honestly, it's more, how do we deliver on the incredible demands fast  enough before competitors do it instead? There is no outbound in that case. The question  is too much inbound, which seems like a nice thing but is actually ...
Jason Lemkin: It's noise.
Solomon: It's noise and it's also, you drop a lot of it on the floor, and  your competitors pick it up.
Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Tracy, I want to come back to your fun story. You hit up 30  of your friends from construction and 29 became customers. As you scale, what do you  do with customer feedback? How important is this? How much do you listen to, how  much of it is noise, how much do you let it guide your roadmap? What  have you learned?
Tracy: I don't know how you build product without listening to your customer's feedback. We've certainly  taken it incredibly seriously. We've logged and categorized every single piece of feedback that our  clients have given us since 2011. It's incredibly easy. We've made that process. You just  come on PlanGrid.com, and you're like, "I want to give you feedback," and then our  support team will take it, they'll ship it over to the product team. We'll look  at it every quarter, and it does help us prioritize. The big task here is  making sure that we're prioritizing the right stuff, because sometimes our users will ask us,  "Can PlanGrid make up my breakfast and dinner." When there's large general contractors and smaller  subcontractors and building owners asking us for the same button and telling us, "If you  just have this thing, it's going to save me so much time," and there's enough  domain experience on the team. When so many customers are asking for the same thing,  it's probably the right thing to build, although tracking is obviously important. We typically look  at it as, how hard is this to build? How much resources do we have  to put into this, versus how much value and impact is it going to give  our users? If it's like low level of effort and high impact, we're going to  prioritize that. That's really helped us guide our product roadmap.
Jason Lemkin: Have you had any of your bigger customers drag your roadmap in a different way  than your smaller customers?
Tracy: Yes, the larger customers, they want to be treated like princes and princesses, that they're  running our entire business. They're incredibly supportive of us. It's nice that not any single  one customer has that big of a percentage of our revenue. They just want to  make sure that we're listening to them and that we're showing them what the future  of PlanGrid looks like, and that we're constantly improving it, because they're not only buying  PlanGrid today, but they're buying PlanGrid six months from now. It's a commitment, it's a  relationship.
Jason Lemkin: It's a long term commitment. How many customers total, to you have at PlanGrid?
Tracy: Tens of thousands.
Jason Lemkin: Tens of thousands. But the revenue distribution, it's probably several orders to magnitude at your  biggest customers. Even if it's a couple percent of revenue, or even in the early  days, when they ask you to build something that's kind of on your roadmap, that's  way out there because this is an issue we all face, do you build it?  The B2C guys all say no, right? But when your big customer wants you to  build a 2019 feature, do you build it?
Tracy: Again, if there's a ton of the big customers asking us for the same thing,  it's easy to prioritize that, but we have never built a feature out for just  one customer. That doesn't make sense. We're building software for the construction industry, not XYZ  construction.
Jason Lemkin: Got it. Harry, Lob, is there a difference between different size customers, on product, what  they want?
Harry: Definitely a big difference between large and small customers. We spent a lot of time  focusing on the larger customers. One thing you mentioned earlier, do our large customers impact  our roadmap? They certainly do. That said, I think it's also about being transparent in  the conversation from the first deal, like, what are you building? You're not just selling  one particular feature or one particular item. It's a roadmap. You're investing in Lob, You're  going to be building infrastructure on that. We need to talk to that roadmap and  when larger customers are purchasing, they're looking at what are we building six months from  now, trying to understand what that is. For us, it's about finding the balance between  the type of customers that we want, and listening to those customers a little bit  more that are more strategic. For us, we're selling something that's very ubiquitous. Mail comes  in many shapes, formats, sizes, and there's literally endless amounts of combinations that we could  do, and if we entertained every single request, we would end up going a million  directions all the time. For us, we focus very strategically on operational mail, mail that  customers are compliant and required to send, as opposed to marketing mail. That's not to  say we don't do a lot of marketing mail. We still do, but when we  think about roadmap conversations and it comes to a trade off between A or B,  we're always going to look at the customer who, one, we have a relationship with,  two is the direction that we want the company to move to begin with. That's  how we prioritize it. Sometimes that means saying "no" to the customer, and oftentimes we've  found their okay with that, so long as you're transparent about what you're trying to  do.
Jason Lemkin: Yeah. You said in the beginning, you guys were five co-founders for two years, right?
Harry: No.
Jason Lemkin: Roughly? I had that wrong?
Harry: No, I think I heard five co-founders.
Jason Lemkin: Oh, is it Tracy five?
Harry: Yeah.
Jason Lemkin: Well, we'll get into equity splits later.
Harry: Okay.
Jason Lemkin: Then at 51 'till I learn how that ... But anyhow, related questions. I want  to ask most of the panel this. As you scale, let's talk about ... Because  this is always a great learning, a mis-hire. As you get out of our core  team, is there a core functional area, or VP, or someone that you thought you  needed or got wrong in the early days? Anything you can learn from? What's the  biggest hiring mistake that you made?
Harry: I don't know about the biggest, but we made a lot.
Jason Lemkin: Most visceral. (laughs)
Harry: We made a lot, I don't know anyone who hasn't.
Jason Lemkin: Yes, but we can learn from this to the next generation ...
Harry: Yeah, we can.
Jason Lemkin: Make this mistake fewer times.
Harry: Yeah, I think the biggest challenge is, once you grow into a fullfledged company, you  grow outside of you zone of comfort. If you're in the technical and product side,  then you have to hire business people. If you're on the business side, you have  to hire more technical and product leadership, and it's things that, at some point, you  don't know, and you don't know what you don't know. I remember as an engineer  hiring non-engineers, it was very difficult for me because I knew I needed help, but  I didn't have the know-how to distinguish the different kinds of non-engineers that I needed.  It seems really silly to say that, but to me, marketing and sales was the  not coding thing. Also, I moved to the US from France, and Americans are extremely  good at selling themselves.
Jason Lemkin: I hear that a lot from European founders. I hear that as a consistent theme  with you.
Harry: You're right here and you meet 10 people, like, "Wow, these are all rock stars  ...
Jason Lemkin: Or to PlanGrid and Box and you're just going to hire them right then and  there, don't you?
Harry: And you do, and then you realize there's more to this. The biggest problem is,  when you hire the wrong person, the state of mind is, "Oh, it's a bad  person, they're bad, and my company's good, and now I hired the bad person." But  really, what's happening is, everyone's wasting your time. It's not the right combination of people.  You're going to find out six months later and it's going to be a terrible  nuisance. I don't really know if I've learned anything how to avoid it, but every  time we've made a mistake, we've tried to really invest the time to go back  and find out why, what we did wrong, so we don't make the same mistake  twice, honestly.
Jason Lemkin: It's not the hire's fault, it's your fault, isn't it?
Harry: Yeah. Exactly. That's exactly right. My feeling is, it's the hardest in the beginning, but  once you have a core group of people, like five key people in areas that  you don't really understand and master, but you build a relationship of trust with those  people, then it gets easier because you trust them to hire more people. The really  bad situation is if you don't sort out that stuff early on, like you make  a hire. You feel like it may be a bad hire, but you don't deal  with it right away, you allow it to fester, and then before you know it,  you're growing and that person has hired 20 more people, and now you're in big  trouble, because now you gotta deal with a mismatch potentially with 20 people. My only  advice would be, you're going to make mistakes, just deal with them early and listen  to your gut. If your gut says, "Oh, maybe this is the wrong thing," trust  yourself, even if it's not your field of expertise. I'm probably repeating common sense here,  but ...
Jason Lemkin: We all make the same mistake. Tracy, I want to hear you're story too, but  let me flip it around. You have five co-founders, right? You probably have a lot  of the ... You felt like you had at least two of the bases covered  in the early days, at least in theory. What was one of these early hires  that the you made that was extremely impactful, that moved the needle, that helped increase  the business?
Tracy: Our employee number one.
Jason Lemkin: Employee number one. Who was that?
Tracy: Just because there was just ... Cory Lorenz ... Early on, there's nothing and you  have to build something from nothing. The more people that we can get on to  the team to help realize our mission as a company is incredibly important, and I  would say the same about employee number two, employee number three, employee number 300.
Jason Lemkin: Was there a particular functional area or someone that changed things for you? They're all  great.
Tracy: We brought them on because we needed help. So, it's hard to just pinpoint one  person.
Jason Lemkin: For sure. Well, let me ask a different question. You have five founders. When do  you bring on VP's or directors or others to take over the functional areas from  them? What did you learn from that experience?
Tracy: The point when we realized that we, as being a founder especially doing it for  the first time, so much of our jobs is just learning on the spot and  trying to get the job done. As we've recruited more people to team, there comes  a point where it's like, "Wow, we have to become really good at managing people.  This is all new for the founders. I think we got really good at it,  especially as just the frontline engineering manager, but there comes a point where we're at  50 people, 150 people, and it's like Dunbar's number. It's complete chaos. Suddenly communication gets  so much harder, and I think that's when we started layering in executives who had  done it before, because now we have the experience of people who aren't like the  founders, who aren't learning on the job, they've done it before, they've done it three  times before, very successfully, and it's just much easier to run the business that way.
Jason Lemkin: Yeah, that's a good insight of when ... We all want to hire the folks  who've done it before early. Not all of us, but we get attracted to the  box on the resume. But maybe that Dunbar number's the right time to think about  it, right? When did you benefit from folks that maybe weren't as fluent in the  product but were fluent in the processes?
Tracy: Yeah, if I could do it over, I would probably bring them on earlier, but  at that point, it's just like you're trying to recruit someone who's very, very good  at their jobs, who are getting paid tons of money at wherever they're at, and  it's hard to recruit them to your little shit startup. You sell you're butts off.  Actually you never stop selling you're butts of about your mission, your vision as a  company, and so being able to deliver that message of what you're trying to do,  and also, showing the traction, showing the growth, when you see that graph, everyone wants  to be a part of it.
Jason Lemkin: They do, yeah. Recruiting is always hard, but was there a moment when it got  easier?
Tracy: Practice. Practicing gets easier, so, I'd say maybe ...
Jason Lemkin: From a brand perspective, did PlanGrid get to the point, did Sequoia or others, or  Press, or you ... I want to ask a related question, but did it get,  in some way, easier when you became a more interesting startup to a broader community?
Tracy: Yeah, so we're a YC company, we're also in the Sequoia portfolio. We flashed that  to our advantage.
Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Good. Harry, any learnings on hiring mistakes or a great hire you made that  moved the needle for you?
Harry: Yeah. It's like I should talk to one. You mentioned it earlier, realizing that you  need to hire good managers, it's a big moment for us in the past couple  of years. That was actually one of the early mistakes we made, which was one  of our best IC's, I thought he wanted to be a manager, and we really  wanted him to manage a team too. He hadn't actually had experience doing that before,  and when we put him in that role, he struggled. That put us through a  tough six months. I think we learned a lesson early on,. It's like you want  people who have already done it once before, because even though you may trust somebody  and they're awesome at what they do, it's hard to discount the value of experience.  That's something, having seen it before, the type of problems you can see, that's made  a big difference. For us, I could say, first most huge hire, it's like we  had somebody in a managing role that didn't pan out and our second head of  engineering was just incredible. He literally made problems disappear. Things that we would sit there  and worry about, I'd be up there with my co-founder talking about this and this  people issue, and next thing we knew, literally three weeks after he started, we just  never talked about it or heard about it again. Everyone seemed to be happy and  working harder and staying longer and we didn't really think we were doing anything different.  We just had somebody different on the roll.
Jason Lemkin: How quickly did you know? 30 days?
Harry: What's that?
Jason Lemkin: How quickly did you know it was impactful? An hour?
Harry: We had the advantage of already having someone on the roll, so we knew what  good looked like and what great was. Obviously, we're always looking at that, but in  the first 30 days, I think you can immediately tell the difference they're having at  the team. Even within the first ... The first two weeks is a lot of  learning, and you can just tell from the quality of the questions that they're asking.  What are they thinking about, how far they are planning ahead. Then, really, we started  seeing a lot of changes happen the second week in terms of taking everything they  learned throughout the interview process, getting to know the company, and also adopting it to  their own style. I think, first and foremost, not just hiring for experience but hiring  for a culture fit is really, really important. We had great hires in the past,  awesome IC's that we let fester a little too long because of cultural things, and  having to rewind that back and a few years later it was definitely challenging. I  think culture fit now, we spend a ton of time throughout the interview process. We've  updated our values, worked into the interview process, each person is responsible for asking one  particular component of that. That's one of the first things we evaluate, regardless of whether  or not the person can do their job. It's like, "Is this someone we'd work  with? Is this someone who's going to fit well, and really bring their own individual  skillset to the company?"
Jason Lemkin: Yeah, that's a good point. Tracy, let me go back to a point you made  about the journey that your customers are signing up for six and 12 months, maybe  their even signing up for 60 months and 100 months. Especially in the early days,  products are super feature poor. You had 29 folks sign up immediately, but it's still  feature ... How do you convince them to go on that journey when you have  incumbents that are feature rich? What have you learned?
Tracy: There's nothing like adoption in the field. There're certainly lots of incumbents, some that you  know very well. There's also a lot of startups here that are just, if you  have any success at all, your software will be copied because they're dealing with that  right now. Just making sure that we are developing products that are actually being used  in the field has been key to PlanGrid's success. Regardless of what VP of Operations  or CIOs want to deploy, the software that's being used on construction site, for real,  is our software because we made sure we were building software for the superintendents and  foremen, and carpenters, and electricians, in a way that is actually powerful to them, that  actually helps them do their jobs better.
Jason Lemkin: This is learning from me, but a lot of your history is coming in from  the field, even if the CIO's office, whoever it is, maybe ...
Tracy: We build software for them too, so we've got admin panels, we have SSO coming  out for them, we've got beautiful graphs and stuff because they are a decision maker,  and that's important to us. I think early days, first four years of PlanGrid, we  were definitely not prioritizing products for the people in the office.
Jason Lemkin: Let's just talk about that for a minute, because that's always interesting. You get in  through the field, they love the product, they can adopt it immediately instead of taking  six months. How did you deal with that conflict, if a different vendor had already  been selected by procurement or ... Any learnings on how to deal with that
Tracy: Yeah, our industry is super interesting, because we essentially sell to construction projects. There's certainly  construction companies that managed several projects at the time, but the beauty of our industry,  and it's both the the best and worst thing, is when we're in a construction  project, there's actually 50 different costumers for us to sell to. There are the carpenters,  there's electricians, there's the concrete folks, the pool installers, the paint person. There's this natural  virality that happens within construction projects. The foreman starts using PlanGrid, and it's a cultural  thing too. As a construction person, you just want to show off your shiny new  tool. PlanGrid is so cool that you want to be the first one to show  everyone else on the project. We were always laser focused at building something that was  easy to adopt, easy to use, and that would spark that network effect within construction  projects. Here's corporate standardizing on a software, then you've got the field which the person  really paying for it is the building owner. We've been just laser focused at getting  our software adopted at the ground level, which is very different than any other software  in this space.
Jason Lemkin: You spent a lot of time on those other users that actually don't pay for  PlanGrid? All the other folks on the project, how do you make them happy too?
Tracy: We made sure to build something that was flexible enough that could be used by  anyone in the architectural engineering and construction industry. Prioritizing product is a key factor here.  We didn't want to build something that was just for one profile. We wanted it  to be flexible enough that it could be used by everyone in the industry.
Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Solomon, let's talk a variant of this sort of competition along the journey for  you. I feel like Docker is a product and a vendor that people are rooting  for. I think there are a lot of the Docker fans, I would say. How  do you invest in that? How do you return that social contract on the product  side, especially as competition increases? As you prove yourself, everyone wants to do something in  the broad container market. Competition's everywhere. How do you keep that 100 NPS That Docker  probably has?
Solomon: Yeah,
Jason Lemkin: Do you measure NPS?
Solomon: We measure NPS, yes.
Jason Lemkin: Happiness?
Solomon: We do. The problem for us is, who do we ask? Because there's a lot  of different audiences. Actually, it's a really interesting comparison ... I think the same thing  is happening in a lot of industries. There was this sort of bottom up, go  to market where first you get the practitioners on board, and then you get their  bosses on board maybe later. Maybe they learn about your product only once ... Dozens  or hundreds of people in their organization are using it.
Jason Lemkin: Even today at Docker?
Solomon: Yeah. So we use that ...
Jason Lemkin: Do you use a rogue app in some
Solomon: We use that heavily, yes. Today, as a business, we target enterprises, very large businesses.  That is our focus. We sell also to small businesses. We're kind of in a  similar situation. You've got the tens of thousands, and then the majority of the revenue  comes from a few hundred. All of them are in this relationship with us as  a vendor because someone on their team at some point said, "New app, awesome Docker,  I want to meet up, sounds great," or, "I saw a discussion online about it."  We owe everything to that, to the community, and there's a lot of positive vibes  in that community. Honestly, it's pretty insane if you've ever been to a Docker meetup,  or we've just had DockerCon ...
Jason Lemkin: We had DockerCon. That was like 5,000 people. Right?
Solomon: It's ridiculous.
Jason Lemkin: In the early days, how do you facilitate that? What are the learnings? How do  you get that flywheel going?
Solomon: Honestly, we started something very small, and we showed it to a few people one  by one. Then, 10 of them came back to our office saying, "Hey, we want  to know more." It was just the most fun three hours of my life. Basically  we're just talking about all the cool stuff we could build at Docker and then  they came back the week after that and it was 40 people, then it was  100. That was the first week of the existence of Docker. Right away, we saw,  okay, there's something special going on here, and there's a community forming, and they're basically  saying, "Hey, you, the company you started this, you're the janitor now. Organize things for  us, because this is our thing now." We just took that job really seriously of  enabling that community to do whatever it decides to do. We've been following that community  ever since, and just removing obstacles for that community to grow, do more things together.  We have a whole team just focused on that, just enabling the community. We have  all these cool programs, we have, I think, 120 meetups in the world, 100,000 people  have
Jason Lemkin: 120 meetups a year. All right.
Solomon: No, so it's 120 locations in the world, each with an average of a meetup  every two months or so.
Jason Lemkin: Got it.
Solomon: Then 100,000 people, I think overall, have showed up at least once to one of  these meetups. There's a Captains program, which is sort of like elite power user, where  the most savvy and articulate users of Docker, we promote them and pay them for  them to go and speak at events and they just become these stars in the  community. It's a huge investment for us, but all of it is about giving back.
Jason Lemkin: Got it. How many of these captains are there, out of curiosity?
Solomon: I think now there's maybe 20, 30. It's a small number.
Jason Lemkin: Probably sounds like a lot to some of us. It's a lot of captains.
Solomon: It's a lot of captains.
Jason Lemkin: But you said you had 400 employees. I mean, they're not employees, but it's a  significant amount of your extended family. Right?
Solomon: Correct. When you see a community, when you see anyone super excited about what you're  doing, just drop everything you're doing and make sure you put themselves at their service.  In our case it's the developers using an open source tool, but it looks like  there's something similar going on. I'm sure there's ... I'm going to say it wrong,  but whatever the job is of someone actually working at a construction site, some of  them, I'm sure, are just huge fans of the tool. They go everywhere and they  tell all their buddies about it, and I think that's how consumer products used to  grow. It's increasingly seeing the best B2B products also grow that way.
Jason Lemkin: Let's make that our last question, because I want to save a few minutes for  questions so we have it. Related to that, I think I already know the answer  for Docker, so let's just do PlanGrid and Lob. Tracy, today, what percent of your  new customers come from word of mouth or brand, or ... All this great goodwill  that you've built across the industry, how does that pay off today?
Tracy: We definitely ship Facebook ads and stuff, but most of our new customers comes from  just word of mouth, organic growth, which is awesome, but then it's also uncontrollable, right?  It just comes naturally to us. We don't know what sparks it, but we know  that if we make our clients happy and we build great product for them that  that does continue to happen year after year.
Jason Lemkin: Is that happening at Lob yet? Are you getting most of your customers from the  base?
Harry: Yeah, our base customers are the folks that are referring a good portion of
Jason Lemkin: You're not having to send all the emails yourself today anymore.
Harry: No. What we've actually found, similar to what Solomon was saying, one of the things  that's interesting, we have these folks that have been at three different companies in like  a four-year span, and have used Lob at three companies.
Jason Lemkin: That's when you know it's working.
Harry: They bring us ...
Jason Lemkin: Yeah, they keep bringing you in.
Harry: They bring us every single time. It's great, because every time I get email from  them it's like a different company it's like, "Hey, I want to bring you here."  I was like, "Great, I'd love to chat with you." You want those folks who  are going to be your evangelist, who love your product, everywhere they go they're going  to find a way to use you because they like it. That's really important and  that played a big part for some of our early customers going to different companies,  bringing us there, and then you also get the referrals, especially, what you want to  do is you want to create word of mouth. We found this to be very  successful at conferences, where we already have a good foundational layer of companies. So, for  us, like, FinTech and the LendingSpace is the big one. We're going out, we're out  to lend it, and our customers will bring their friends over. "Oh, yeah. These guys  are great." There's nothing like a positive referral from someone who's an existing customer to  somebody else that's doing something similar. That is part of the reason we go every  single year, and we sit there and smile, we host a customer appreciation event, and  eventually we would love to get to the point where we could do a Lob  Con, get a bunch of folks together.
Jason Lemkin: You may be ready already, actually, I think. Right? You may be ready. All right,  We keep going on this, but let's take some questions. Anyone got any great questions  for the panel?
Audience: I was wondering what was one past experience that you think helped the most while  starting your own company?
Speaker 1: Jason, can you repeat the questions?
Jason Lemkin: I can. The question was, what was one ... I like redundancy. I worry. I  like five nines of uptime. What was one experience prior to starting your company that  actually helped you get it off the ground?
Tracy: Two of the five co-founders of PlanGrid had built buildings before, and the other three  were building software. Just our ability to rally resources and people and build something together,  the ability to work together really helped us work in a startup together. It just  feels like the medium's changed. For me, instead of concrete and brick, it's people and  code and more people.
Jason Lemkin: Do you think you could penetrate the industry with no domain expertise? I'm sure it's  been done, but what's your learning on domain expertise?
Tracy: I think it's possible, you just have to become an expert fast. Somehow you have  to compensate for it.
Harry: I can to comment on that a little bit. I didn't have any domain expertise  in mail. I don't think a ton of people had domain expertise in mail.
Tracy: You're an expert now, right?
Harry: I am an expert now, though, and certainly that's something I've learned. For me, past  experience ... When I came out of college, I went to Microsoft, and this is  the last place in the world you'd expect to send mail and have it be  effective. One of the projects I worked on there, for multiple different privacy reasons like  we're not allowed to email, we couldn't do it through the channel for another couple  of reasons, and my only option was either calling everybody, which didn't seem very feasible  at the time, or sending people these nice little kits. It turns out the best  performing thing was mail. I ended up spending three months and hundreds of thousand dollars,  huge budgets, working on this and realizing that this is something people actually do, and  companies like Microsoft do every day and it works, but it's really hard and it's  ancient. We had people suggesting us automation, paying tens of thousands of dollars for implementation  to get an FTP folder that we drop an Excel file into. It seems sort  of ridiculous but that was part of the inspiration for how we started working on  Lob.
Jason Lemkin: Go ahead.
Audience: What are your thoughts about big companies who can offer a computing service or product  that can leverage their operations expertise, kind of like Amazon, for example?
Jason Lemkin: Yeah or let's say how do you deal with big companies that can do it  all? How do you deal with that situation?
Solomon: I think there's a generic answer that's true for every business for every startup and  then there's maybe some domain-specific answers. Personally, I think something that's true for all startups  is that you have focus and you have speed. I had never worked at a  large company before, so I did not appreciate exactly the advantage we have as a  smaller company. Now, that we're growing a little bit, I can already tell what happens  when you grow. The goal really is to take advantage of our small size while  we're small faster than we accumulate problems as we grow. When you're big and you  have a successful business, everyone working there, the majority of people working there, first of  all, were not there at the time when the business became successful. It's long forgotten  how they became successful in the first place. They're administrating an existing cash cow. That's  a completely different kind of people, generally speaking, except maybe at the very top. You  got a few VPs that are the original guy who did it and then he's  running something, but usually these are people who, at your average large company, they're not  united as one group to make that company succeed against outside threats like you. They  are focused usually on their career. Are they going to get promoted? Are they going  to get more people under them? It's inside facing rather than outside facing. Most large  companies are like that and that's an advantage because they're not looking for threats. The  other advantage is focus. Large companies tend to be doing a lot of things and  when you're competing with a company who has 10,000 people and you have 10, it  might seem really daunting, but the particular parts of that company that is actually competing  with you, for all you know, might also be 10 people. They might be underfunded.  They might be on the wrong side of the big boss, who just doesn't care  about the product. Over time, as you start competing, you'll find out which ones are  serious threats and which ones are basically to be ignored.
Jason Lemkin: It's hard to tell from the outside.
Solomon: Hard to tell, but as you start becoming an expert and you talk to customers,  it's pretty easy. Customers are going to say, "Well, I'm thinking about you and these  other two three things." Some names are going to come up a lot. Some of  them will be other startups. Some of them will be other big companies. Then, you  narrow down your focus and you figure out, "Okay, what makes that big company smarter  than the others?" You can break down the problem basically.
Jason Lemkin: Go ahead.
Audience: What do you think the biggest factors are that the customers to tell other customers  about your product?
Jason Lemkin: That's the magic question. What do you think the biggest factors are that create this  word of mouth, they get other customers to refer you out? What can you point  to specifically?
Tracy: The short answer's is good product, something that saves them time. At the end of  the day, that’s all we care about. We've got this one precious thing that we  don't get more of and because PlanGrid absolutely saves our users' time, it's why they've  told everyone else.
Jason Lemkin: Let me just ... Harry, I'm going to ask you a variant of that question.  You had the great story of the customer that left, the 3x, that's a great  story, but in B2B it's hard for that to happen in three weeks, right?
Harry: Yeah.
Jason Lemkin: How long did that take to get those three customers out of that first great  experience?
Harry: Yeah. I think the first thing I realized is customers aren't going to just, all  of a sudden, start referring them to you. They want to build a relationship and  trust you. The only reason why that happened because the first year, it went from  this particular individual start off as a very, very small, like couple of thousand of  dollar a month customer, and grew to be like a $50,000-$60,000 a month customer, very,  very large in a short period of time. We did a lot. In a lot  of things, we were very transparent. "Hey, we can't get this done in this timeframe.  Here's what we can do." I had a cell phone number. We frequently text when  things go wrong. For us, I think the biggest reason why he actually went and  referred us is because of how we handled things when things didn't go the way  we planned. Everybody wants projects to go perfectly, launch on time. The reality is it  doesn't always happen that way. Sometimes there's factors out of your control. I think the  way that we handled ourselves when things didn't go planned was a huge vote in  confidence, like "This is a company that we can trust" because we're watching people scramble.  I remember there's one instance around Christmas. Some deliveries didn't happen for key customers. We  went out and drove out and just like delivered it. I was like, "Yeah, the  guy's like down the street. It's not big deal. We'll just go get it done."  He was hugely appreciative. That was a small thing and it was a very small  campaign that he was doing, but the stories like that that he clings on to  when he goes to a new company and is like, "The reason why I worked  with these guys is 'cause they did all this for us. When things were not  going well, they still stepped up and did the right thing." That's why they love  us today. I think it starts with having your product. If your product's not good,  no matter what you do for the customer is probably not going to take you  because then he's putting his job at risk.
Speaker 1: We should wrap it up there.
Jason Lemkin: Wrap it up there? All right, let's thank the panel. This was great. Thank you  everybody. (applause)
