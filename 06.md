#　How to Build a Product III

#如何构建产品III

Speaker 1: Good afternoon, everybody. Today we're going to do a session on B2B product. We have  a panel. Jason Lemkin is going to moderate, thank you very much. We have Solomon  from Docker, Tracy from PlanGrid, and Harry from Lob. Thank you all very much for  coming.

各位下午好。今天，我们将做一个关于B2B产品的会议。我们有一个小组。杰森·莱姆金要温和一点，非常感谢。我们有来自Docker的所罗门，PlanGrid的Tracy和Lob的Harry。非常感谢大家的光临。

Jason Lemkin: So, this is a great session. Everyone's seen all the prior sessions online, right? Raise  your hand if you haven't. All right, good. 100%. They're great.

杰森·莱姆金：那么，这是一个伟大的会议。每个人都在网上看到了之前所有的会议，对吧？如果你没有举手。好的，很好。百分之百。他们很棒。

I watched Aaron Levy,  and we had Dustin Moskovitz, and Stewart Butterfield, and others, and what I thought would  be particularly fun since we have three amazing founders here of B2B Companies is to  particularly hone in on the intersection of building great products and revenue, because we all  want to be product visionaries.

我看了亚伦·利维，我们有达斯汀·莫斯科维茨，斯图尔特·巴特菲尔德和其他人，我认为特别有趣的是，我们这里有三位B2B公司惊人的创始人，他们在打造伟大的产品和收入的交汇点上特别努力，因为我们都想成为产品的幻想家。

I certainly did myself. But if you can't sell it  and it's a B2B product, ultimately what's the point of all of it? So, I  want to dig into a couple of stories, both in the early days and a  little bit later, to help folks like you who probably just have inklings of how  to potentially monetize your dreams, because the stories are always different than we think. So,  let me give 10 seconds on each of the panelists and let me have them  dig in a little big more on their companies. Solomon, from Docker, I don't know  who here knows about Docker, but I see most of the 300,000 folks online that'll  read it, but Docker ... He'll give you some more context ... Founded in 2010,  but not as Docker, as ... What was it called back then?
Solomon: Dotcloud.

当然是我自己干的。但是，如果你不能出售它，它是一个B2B产品，最终的意义是什么呢？所以，我想挖掘几个故事，在早期和稍晚一点，以帮助像你这样的人，他们可能只是对如何潜在的赚钱你的梦想，因为故事总是不同的，我们认为。所以，让我给每个小组成员10秒的时间，让我让他们更多地了解他们的公司。所罗门，从码头来的，我不知道这里谁知道码头，但我在网上看到的300，000人中的大多数人都会读，但是码头.他会给你更多的背景.。成立于2010年，但不是作为码头，作为.那时候叫什么来着？所罗门：多特云。

Jason Lemkin: Dotcloud, which we'll get to a story. Raised almost 200 million, and Docker is sort  of a foundational piece of infrastructure that everyone builds software on today. So, we'll get  into that, but it is seven years into this journey, right? Into a likely a  seven year journey or fourteen year journey. Tracy, probably is probably in the middle of  this rock star group. PlanGrid was founded a little bit later. 2011?
Tracy: 2011.

杰森·莱姆金：DotCloud，我们会讲一个故事。筹集了近2亿美元，而Docker是一个基本的基础设施，如今每个人都在此基础上构建软件。所以，我们会讨论这个问题，但这段旅程已经七年了，对吧？可能是七年之旅或十四年之旅。特雷西，可能是在这个摇滚歌星群的中间。PlanGrid是在稍晚一些时候创建的。2011年？特雷西：2011年。

Jason Lemkin: Got it. Raised 60 million?
Tracy: Something like that.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。筹集了六千万？特蕾西：差不多吧。

Jason Lemkin: Right. So, money isn't everything, but it does help. PlanGrid, you'll all learn, is super  cool, automates construction management and has shaken up a shockingly large industry, shockingly large part  of software. You'll learn a little bit more about those stories.

杰森·莱姆金：对。所以，钱不是万能的，但它确实有帮助。你们都会知道，PlanGrid是超级酷的，自动化的建筑管理，已经动摇了一个令人震惊的大行业，令人震惊的大部分软件。你会学到更多关于这些故事的。

I want to learn  more. Then, Harry runs Lob, which turns mail into an API, which, I think, is  pretty interesting. Raised 10 million, so, he's got another 190 million to catch up on  50 million, but off to a very strong start. Founded in 2013?
Harry: Yes.

我想学更多。然后，Harry运行LOB，它将邮件转换为API，我认为这非常有趣。他筹得一千万，所以，他又有一亿九千万人要追上五千万，但开局很好。成立于2013年？哈利：是的。

Jason Lemkin: So, you're ...  What's that?  All right, so you're four years in, right? So it's just when it's getting both  good and hard, right? At the same time, I would imagine, right? So, I want  to dig in. Those are the intros, but give me a little bit more intro  on the company. Number of employees, and what's the latest challenge you have today, or  any other quick tidbits on the company.

杰森·莱姆金：那么，你.那是什么？好吧，你在这里呆了四年了，对吧？所以只有当它变得既好又难的时候，对吗？同时，我可以想象，对吧？所以，我想钻研一下。这些都是自我介绍，但请给我更多关于公司的介绍。员工人数，你今天面临的最新挑战是什么，或者公司的任何其他快速消息。

Solomon: Sure, so currently it's 350 employees at Docker. We actually started in 2008.

所罗门：当然，现在码头公司有350名员工。我们实际上是从2008年开始的。

Jason Lemkin: 2008.

杰森·莱姆金：2008年。

Solomon: Yeah, with bootstraps in France, and it wasn't working so we moved here, got into  YC, and that really, really helped. So, anyway.

所罗门：是啊，法国的鞋带不起作用，所以我们搬到了这里，进入了YC，这真的很有帮助。所以无论如何。

Jason Lemkin: Got it.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。

Solomon: Nine years.

所罗门：九年。

Jason Lemkin: Did you sort of refound the company . You don't count those early years, or  you do?
Solomon: It depends on who you ask, but yeah, it counts, the same company, same problem  we're trying to solve. So, 350 employees, lots of growth, lots of excitement. The biggest  challenge for us, the biggest challenge last year, was proving that we could build a  business, a viable high growth business on top of this excitement for stuff that is,  in large part, free and open source. That was last year. We proved that model,  and this year the challenge is to scale it, and to scale it faster than  our competitors who now have figured out that the model is proven, so there's a  big competitive battle in a really lucrative space. So that's the challenge this year.

杰森·莱姆金：你是不是重新建立了公司。你不算那些早年，还是你算了？所罗门：这取决于你问谁，但是的，这是重要的，同一家公司，同样的问题，我们正在努力解决。因此，350名员工，大量增长，非常兴奋。对我们来说，最大的挑战，去年最大的挑战，是证明我们可以建立一个企业，一个可行的高增长企业，在这种兴奋的基础上，在很大程度上，免费和开放源码。那是去年的事。我们证明了这个模型，今年的挑战是扩大它，并且比我们的竞争对手更快地扩展它，而我们的竞争对手现在已经发现这个模型已经被证明了，所以在一个非常有利可图的领域里有一场激烈的竞争。这就是今年的挑战。

Jason Lemkin: Good.

杰森·莱姆金：很好。

Tracy: Hi, everyone. My name is Tracy Young, I'm one of the co-founders and CEO of  PlanGrid. PlanGrid builds, as you said, beautiful, simple, effective software for the construction industry. We  emerged from Y Combinator's winner of 2012 batch, and since then we've grown from five  co-founders to 310 people, which is not something to brag about.

大家好。我叫特雷西·杨，是PlanGrid的联合创始人和首席执行官之一。你说过，PlanGrid为建筑业构建了漂亮、简单、有效的软件。我们从Y Combinator 2012年的获奖者中脱颖而出，从那时起，我们已经从5位联合创始人成长为310人，这不是什么值得夸耀的事情。

It means our payroll  is very high. We've helped build over 500,000 construction projects, from the smallest kitchen remodels  to the largest projects in the world. We are available on all of the platforms.  Apple actually named us one of the top 10 enterprise apps of 2016, which is  pretty awesome. Now we're also the largest digital blueprint repository in the world. We have  over 50 million sheets of blueprints in our cloud and growing.

这意味着我们的工资很高。我们帮助建造了500，000多个建筑项目，从最小的厨房改造到世界上最大的项目。我们可以在所有的平台上使用。苹果实际上把我们列为2016年前10大企业应用之一，这真是太棒了。现在我们也是世界上最大的数字蓝图存储库。我们的云中有超过5000万张蓝图，而且还在不断增长。

Harry: Thanks.

哈利：谢谢。

I'm sitting here. We've got 40 employees, wishing I had 150. A little bit  about Lob, I'm one of the founders. My name is Harry Zhang.

我坐在这里。我们有40名员工，希望我有150人。有点关于Lob的事，我是创始人之一。我叫张哈利。

I started the  company in 2013, and what we do is build tools to make it easy for  developers to control the offline world. We actually deal with the physical component, an industry  that many of you think may be dying but in fact is very much the  opposite, dealing with letters, post cards, and other types of mail, and really building a  layer of technology on top of that to make it easy for companies to do  that. Hopefully, many of you have received a piece of mail from Lob, especially in  this area and the Bay Area, and we service companies ... We're trying to make  this switch into selling to mid market and other startups and to selling it to  the Fortune 500. So, a lot of our challenges today is how do we move  into enterprise, and take what used to be a one single tool and translate it  into a larger full solution for larger companies.

我在2013年创立了这家公司，我们所做的就是构建工具，让开发者更容易地控制离线世界。我们实际上处理的是物理部分，你们中的许多人认为这个行业可能正在消亡，但事实上恰恰相反，处理信件、明信片和其他类型的邮件，并在此基础上建立一层技术，使公司更容易做到这一点。希望你们中的许多人都收到了LOB的一封邮件，尤其是在这个地区和海湾地区，我们为公司提供服务.我们正试图将这一转变为向中型市场和其他初创公司销售，并将其出售给财富500强(Fortune 500)。因此，我们今天面临的许多挑战是，我们如何进入企业，并把过去是一个单一的工具，并将其转化为一个更大的大公司的全面解决方案。

Jason Lemkin: Good. Hang on to the microphones because there's just one other question I want to  ask the whole panel.

杰森·莱姆金：很好。抓住麦克风，因为只有一个问题，我想问整个小组。

I'd really like to talk about the concept of a minimum  sellable product, not a viable product, what it actually takes to make real money. Harry,  tell me what happened with Lob. Do no count other companies from your batch or  customers you've got off Hacker News. How did you get that first, those first, unaffiliated  customers, and what made the product sellable? Share it.

我真的很想谈一谈最低可卖产品的概念，而不是一个可行的产品，它实际上需要什么才能赚到真正的钱。哈利，告诉我洛布怎么了。不要计算其他公司从你的批次或客户，你已经从黑客新闻。你是如何得到第一批，没有关联的客户的，以及是什么使产品可以销售？分享吧。

Harry: Yeah, I think one of the common things that's easy to get in the habit  of thinking that customers are going to come to you because you have a great  product or a great solution. That works, maybe, in the beginning for smaller companies, but  as you go after your first real customer ... Our first real customer was Oscar  Insurance over in New York. So, the way we got to them was cold email,  and we sent thousands and thousands of emails.

哈利：是的，我认为一个很容易养成的习惯就是，顾客会来找你，因为你有很好的产品或很好的解决方案。这对小公司来说也许是可行的，但是当你追求你的第一个真正的客户时.我们第一个真正的客户是纽约的奥斯卡保险公司。所以，我们得到他们的方式是冷冰冰的电子邮件，我们发送了成千上万的电子邮件。

I, personally, wrote every single one, and  got a response from the CEO.

就我个人而言，我写了每一封信，并得到了首席执行官的回复。

I think one of the key things is to  really have an understanding of why our company is going to talk to you. What  is the problem that you're solving for them as opposed to like, "Here's my product  does, and these are the features that I have." You want to be very pinpoint  about what that message is. People are actually surprisingly open to respond to your email,  as long as it's relevant. For us, we happen to hit on the problem for  Oscar, which is they had a mail vendor. They knew there was this regulation called  HIPAA, which is essentially how you govern and control private health information, and what we  realized was that this was our opportunity. They're looking at new vendors. They did not  trust that their existing vendor had HIPAA and was secured. We could point to a  small customer we'd already done it for in the past. That's how we got into  the conversation. Took us about two or three months to get the deal done, but  really, what you need is to identify a core problem that larger companies haven't quite  figured out, and even if your solution isn't the best that's out there, it needs  to be to a point where the customers are willing to buy. We started off  of one use case, very, very simple explanation of benefits. Today, we send probably 50  different types of mail, checks, postcards, practically everything, but the key is to pick one  small use case that they have a real problem around and that you're going to  go solve. So, that's what we did with Oscar.

我认为关键的事情之一是真正理解我们公司为什么要和你交谈。你为他们解决的问题是什么，而不是“这是我的产品，这些是我的特色。”你想要非常准确地知道这个信息是什么。事实上，人们对你的电子邮件的回复是非常开放的，只要它是相关的。对我们来说，我们碰巧碰到了奥斯卡的问题，那就是他们有一个邮递员。他们知道有这样一种叫做HIPAA的规则，它本质上就是你管理和控制私人卫生信息的方式，我们意识到这是我们的机会。他们在找新的供应商。他们不相信他们现有的供应商有HIPAA并且是安全的。我们可以指出一个小客户，我们已经这样做了，在过去。我们就是这样开始谈话的。我们花了两三个月的时间才完成了这笔交易，但实际上，你需要的是找出一个大公司还没有完全解决的核心问题，即使你的解决方案不是最好的，也需要达到客户愿意购买的程度。我们从一个用例开始，非常简单地解释好处。今天，我们可能发送50种不同类型的邮件，支票，明信片，几乎所有东西，但关键是选择一个小用例，它们周围有一个真正的问题，你要去解决。这就是我们对奥斯卡所做的。

It's funny, to this date, they're  still one of our larger customers, and it all just came from a three sentence  email to the CEO.

有趣的是，到目前为止，他们仍然是我们更大的客户之一，这一切都来自给首席执行官的一封三句话的电子邮件。

Jason Lemkin: Do you remember what the headline of the email was?
Harry: It was like, "We can help you with your mail."
Jason Lemkin: We can help you with your mail. That worked, huh?
Harry: It did work. We've now learned a lot. That's probably one I'd do today. At  the time, we knew that healthcare sent a lot of mail and we also did  that "You've Got Mail." Which got a pretty good chuckle from folks in the day.  Really, the core of the content that was in the first few lines was just  like, "We know companies have problems sending secure, audible mail, but we built a technology  solution around doing this. Do you have 15 minutes to talk about it?" That's pretty  much what the core content was, but the key is to get straight to the  point. What are you going to solve? What's the problem, and asking for a little  bit more time.

杰森·莱姆金：你还记得这封邮件的标题是什么吗？哈利：就像，“我们可以帮你处理你的邮件。”杰森·莱姆金：我们可以帮你处理你的邮件。起作用了，是吧？哈利：确实起作用了。我们现在学到了很多。这可能是我今天要做的。当时，我们知道医疗保健部门发了很多邮件，我们也发了“你有邮件”。这件事在一天中得到了人们的欢声笑语。实际上，最初几行内容的核心是，“我们知道公司在发送安全、可听到的邮件方面有问题，但我们围绕这一点建立了一个技术解决方案。你有15分钟的时间来谈论吗？”这基本上是核心内容，但关键是要直截了当。你要解决什么？有什么问题，并要求更多的时间。

I never talked to the CEO, but he punted me down the  chain, but got the right guys eventually.

我从来没有和首席执行官谈过话，但他把我推倒了，但最终找到了合适的人。

Jason Lemkin: Tracy, I'm not an expert, but you're probably competing with bigger, traditional, older incumbents in  some ways the mob was. Do I have that wrong? What got you sellable? What  got you really off the ground? Beautiful software is great, but we all want to  build that, right? What made it sellable?
Tracy: Sure, our first 10 users ...

杰森·莱姆金：特蕾西，我不是专家，但你很可能在某些方面与更大、更传统、更老的在位者竞争。我有错吗？是什么让你卖出去的？是什么让你真正离开了地面？漂亮的软件是很棒的，但是我们都想构建它，对吗？是什么让它卖出去的？当然，我们的前10个用户.。

I'm trained as a construction engineer, so the first  10 users were definitely people we had worked with in the field.

我是一名建筑工程师，所以最初的10个用户肯定是我们在这个领域工作过的人。

It's easy to  get our friends to try out our software, it's incredibly difficult to get our friends  to start paying for it.

让我们的朋友试用我们的软件是很容易的，让我们的朋友开始为它付费是非常困难的。

Jason Lemkin: That is a difference.

杰森·莱姆金：这是不同的。

Tracy: So, building something that they wanted and that they needed that added undeniable value to  their day to day was the moment they started paying us.

特蕾西：所以，建造他们想要的东西，以及他们需要的东西，给他们的日常生活增加了不可否认的价值，这就是他们开始付钱给我们的那一刻。

Jason Lemkin: Was the feedback from your non paying friends useful? Was it unhelpful? Was it dis-helpful?
Tracy: So, our first beta group, which included mostly people I had worked with in the  field, was about 30 people, 29 of them started paying us as soon as the  beta was over.

杰森·莱姆金：你的非付费朋友的反馈有用吗？没什么用吗？有用吗？特蕾西：所以，我们的第一个测试组，主要包括我在这个领域工作过的人，大约有30人，其中29人在测试结束后就开始付钱给我们。

Jason Lemkin: They did pay you?
Tracy: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

杰森·莱姆金：他们确实付钱给你了？特蕾西：嗯-嗯(是的)。

Jason Lemkin: Got it. Okay, so were they bigger critics than outside customers? Sometimes it's hard to  figure out how to take advantage of friends as customers.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。好吧，他们是比外部客户更大的批评者吗？有时很难搞清楚如何利用朋友作为顾客。

Tracy: Yeah, you're really testing my memory. No, at that point, in 2011, 2012, it was  about, "I want this to do more for us. Can you build the XYZ?"
Jason Lemkin: Got it. Obviously the product was feature poor at the time. Right? What was the  one piece that was 10X better?
Tracy: Simply prints are at the core of PlanGrid, replaces physical blueprints. Fold out maps, we  don't have them anymore. Actually, with this group, you guys have probably never purchased a  fold out map before. We use Waze, we use Apple Maps, we use Google Maps,  and with blueprints, it's the same analogy. These massive, incredibly dense pieces of paper with  information, an they just don't render quickly on PDF viewers.

是啊，你真的在考验我的记忆力。不，在那个时候，在2011年，2012年，它是关于，“我希望这能为我们做更多。你能建立XYZ吗？”杰森·莱姆金：明白了。很明显，当时的产品性能很差。对吗？哪一件比10倍更好？特雷西：简单地说，打印是PlanGrid的核心，取代了物理蓝图。折出地图，我们就没有了。事实上，在这个小组里，你们可能从来没有买过一张折叠地图。我们使用Waze，我们使用苹果地图，我们使用Google地图，对于蓝图，这是相同的类比。这些巨大的，令人难以置信地密集的文件与信息，他们只是不迅速呈现在PDF上的观众。

It was just
Jason Lemkin: What was the pitch to make your beautiful product sellable? Was it regular 100 times  faster?
Tracy: I'm really glad.

这只是杰森·莱姆金：你的漂亮产品的卖点是什么？它的速度是常规的100倍吗？特蕾西：我真的很高兴。

I was hoping you'd ask me what the tagline was.

我希望你能问我标语是什么。

Jason Lemkin: What was the tagline?
Tracy: Our tagline, and this was from my co-founder Kenny, our tagline was PlanGrid eliminates the  bullshit, except that marketing has now changed it. We're the productivity software for construction.

杰森·莱姆金：标语是什么？特蕾西：我们的口号，这是来自我的联合创始人肯尼，我们的口号是平面网格消除了胡扯，除了营销现在改变了它。我们是建筑的生产力软件。

Jason Lemkin: Got it. Okay. Well, we'll dig in more on that. Boy, where do we want  to answer this question. We start hosting applications for others. What's the early history? Tell  us what didn't work, or at least didn't scale, and what did work sellable product.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。好的。好吧，我们会深入研究的。孩子，我们想在哪里回答这个问题。我们开始为其他人托管应用程序。早期的历史是什么？告诉我们什么不起作用，或者至少没有扩大规模，什么是可销售的产品。

Solomon: Sure. The background here is, nine years in, we started out as a company called  Dotcloud, and now we're a different company called Docker, but there was a common thread.  It's the same company, the same team with the same mission, but we changed how  we do it.

所罗门：当然。这里的背景是，九年过去了，我们一开始是一家叫做DotCloud的公司，现在我们是另一家叫做Docker的公司，但是有一个共同的线索。这是同一个公司，同一个团队，有着同样的使命，但我们改变了我们的做法。

In the first phase as Dotcloud, we ... Well, let me start  with what the common thread is. The common thread is we help developers be more  productive. We give them tools to create applications, and then we help the businesses behind  those developers solve their business problems with the creation of software. We're serving on these  trends of more people creating software to do more things. The first phase, we did  that by hosting the applications. So, we said, "Just write the codes, upload it to  us, we'll take care of everything. We'll run it for you, we'll manage it for  you, all of it." Now, it's Docker. We don't do the hosting. We provide the  tools. You use the tools yourself, and then you host the application, and eventually, as  a business, you need help with various aspects of distributing your software at large scale.  In the first phase, we're very small, we didn't have any sort of hype behind  us. We were just trying to convince developers to use our stuff. Honestly, we used  our own community. We're programmers. We write software, and we know a lot of other  programmers and we just annoyed the hell out of all of them to use our  stuff. We gave it to them for free, and then through the individual programmers, eventually  made our way to the business behind the programmers. The difference, I think, is that,  for us, it's a two-step process. Our users and our biggest advocates are not the  people paying for the product. That means we have to give a lot of stuff  away for free before we even get the first conversation with the actual buyer.

作为DotCloud的第一阶段，我们.好吧，让我从共同的线索开始。共同的思路是，我们帮助开发人员提高生产力。我们为他们提供了创建应用程序的工具，然后我们帮助那些开发人员通过创建软件来解决他们的业务问题。我们服务于更多的人创造软件来做更多的事情的趋势。第一阶段，我们通过托管应用程序来做到这一点。所以，我们说，“只要写代码，上传给我们，我们就会处理好一切。我们会为你运行它，我们会为你管理它，所有的一切。”现在是码头。我们不主持。我们提供工具。您自己使用这些工具，然后托管应用程序，最终，作为一个企业，您需要在大规模分发软件的各个方面得到帮助。在第一阶段，我们很小，我们没有任何炒作。我们只是想说服开发者使用我们的东西。老实说，我们利用了自己的社区。我们是程序员。我们编写软件，我们认识许多其他程序员，我们只是恼怒了他们中的所有使用我们的东西。我们给他们免费的，然后通过个别的程序员，最终我们的方式到业务背后的程序员。我想，区别在于，对我们来说，这是一个两步的过程。我们的用户和我们最大的拥护者不是为产品付费的人。这意味着，在我们与实际买家进行第一次对话之前，我们必须免费赠送很多东西。

Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Those first early years, it's not even the same product you have today remotely,  right? How did you survive? Did you raise 50 million in your seed round, or  how did you pull this off?
Solomon: No.

杰森·莱姆金：是的。在最初的几年里，它甚至不是你今天远程拥有的相同的产品，对吗？你是怎么活下来的？你在你的种子中筹集了5000万美元，或者你是如何做到这一点的？所罗门：不。

Jason Lemkin: Surviving is a hard part, right?
Solomon: When you're a very small team, you have a limited window of time where you  can survive but not a lot.

杰森·莱姆金：生存是很难的，对吧？所罗门：当你是一个很小的团队，你有一个有限的时间窗口，你可以生存，但不是很多。

Jason Lemkin: It's hard, usually, for that to last much more than 24 months, isn't it?
Solomon: That's right. We joined Y Combinator, in 2010, and raised our first small round of  funding at the end of 2010, so within six months. We went at it gradually.  It's nothing particularly unique there.

杰森·莱姆金：通常情况下，持续24个月以上是很难的，不是吗？所罗门：没错。我们在2010年加入了Y Combinator，并在2010年底筹集了我们的第一轮小额资金，因此在六个月内。我们逐渐地去做了。那里没什么特别的。

Jason Lemkin: But you got into YC about 24 months after founding? That was ...

杰森·莱姆金：但你在成立24个月后进入了YC？那是.。

Solomon: Yeah, so the first part was really tough.

所罗门：是的，所以第一部分真的很难。

It was bootstraps. We did consulting, we  did
Jason Lemkin: Consulting was the hack.

是鞋带。我们做了咨询，我们做了杰森·莱姆金：咨询就是黑客。

Solomon: It was the hack. Whatever we had to do to pay the bills, it was  really tough. My advice would be consulting and product building, they're vary useful, but you  gotta get out of it really quickly because consulting takes all of your time. You  will never get off the ground as a product company. There's too much distraction in  consulting. Eventually we just took a leap of faith and landed on our feet in  Y Combinator.

所罗门：是黑客干的。无论我们要做什么来支付账单，都是非常困难的。我的建议是咨询和产品建设，它们是不同的有用的，但你必须尽快摆脱它，因为咨询占用了你所有的时间。作为一家产品公司，你永远不会起步。咨询太分散注意力了。最后，我们只是在信心上的飞跃，在Y组合器中站稳了脚跟。

Jason Lemkin: Got it. One last question and then I want to move on to the next  topic, but what is now Docker has gone through two and a half evolutions as  a business model. You've made open source work for you. What's the secret there? What's  the learning? We think it's hard to monetize open source.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。最后一个问题，然后我想转到下一个话题，但是现在的Docker已经经历了两个半的演变，作为一个商业模式。您已经为您提供了开放源代码。那有什么秘密？学到了什么？我们认为开源很难赚钱。

Solomon: Yeah, so honestly, I don't know how useful my insights are here because, really, the  trick is to get really lucky. The situation we're in now is that the open  source technology that we develop, Docker, is extremely popular. We were in the right place  at the right time. There's this whole trend around containers, which we helped start, and  now, just the demand for it is, honestly, hard to describe. You start having a  completely different set of problems once you're in that situation. Honestly, the problems we had  before that moment, in 2013, when we launched the open source Docker and after, are  worlds apart. Now, honestly, it's more, how do we deliver on the incredible demands fast  enough before competitors do it instead? There is no outbound in that case. The question  is too much inbound, which seems like a nice thing but is actually ...

所罗门：是的，所以说实话，我不知道我的洞察力有多大，因为，真的，诀窍是获得真正的幸运。我们现在的情况是，我们开发的开源技术Docker非常流行。我们在正确的时间在正确的地点。整个趋势围绕着集装箱，这是我们帮助开始的，现在，仅仅是对它的需求，诚实地说，很难描述。一旦你处在这种情况下，你就会有一套完全不同的问题。老实说，我们在那之前，2013年，也就是我们推出开源Docker之前和之后遇到的问题，都是天壤之别。现在，老实说，更重要的是，我们如何在竞争对手这么做之前，以足够快的速度满足这些令人难以置信的需求？在这种情况下没有出站。问题是太多的入境，这似乎是一件好事，但实际上是.

Jason Lemkin: It's noise.

杰森·莱姆金：这是噪音。

Solomon: It's noise and it's also, you drop a lot of it on the floor, and  your competitors pick it up.

所罗门：这是噪音，而且，你把很多东西掉在地板上，你的竞争对手就会捡起来。

Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Tracy, I want to come back to your fun story. You hit up 30  of your friends from construction and 29 became customers. As you scale, what do you  do with customer feedback? How important is this? How much do you listen to, how  much of it is noise, how much do you let it guide your roadmap? What  have you learned?
Tracy: I don't know how you build product without listening to your customer's feedback. We've certainly  taken it incredibly seriously. We've logged and categorized every single piece of feedback that our  clients have given us since 2011.

杰森·莱姆金：是的。特蕾西，我想回到你有趣的故事。你拜访了30位来自建筑业的朋友，其中29位成为了客户。随着你的规模，你做什么对客户的反馈？这有多重要？你听了多少，有多少是噪音，有多少是你的路线图？你学到了什么？特蕾西：我不知道你是如何在不听取客户反馈的情况下生产产品的。我们确实非常认真地对待这件事。自2011年以来，我们记录并分类了客户给我们的每一条反馈信息。

It's incredibly easy. We've made that process. You just  come on PlanGrid.com, and you're like, "I want to give you feedback," and then our  support team will take it, they'll ship it over to the product team. We'll look  at it every quarter, and it does help us prioritize. The big task here is  making sure that we're prioritizing the right stuff, because sometimes our users will ask us,  "Can PlanGrid make up my breakfast and dinner." When there's large general contractors and smaller  subcontractors and building owners asking us for the same button and telling us, "If you  just have this thing, it's going to save me so much time," and there's enough  domain experience on the team. When so many customers are asking for the same thing,  it's probably the right thing to build, although tracking is obviously important. We typically look  at it as, how hard is this to build? How much resources do we have  to put into this, versus how much value and impact is it going to give  our users? If it's like low level of effort and high impact, we're going to  prioritize that. That's really helped us guide our product roadmap.

这太容易了。我们已经完成了这个过程。你只要在PlanGrid.com上来，你就会说，“我想给你反馈，”然后我们的支持团队就会接受，他们会把它交给产品团队。我们每季度都会看一看，这确实有助于我们确定优先次序。这里的主要任务是确保我们把正确的东西放在优先顺序，因为有时候我们的用户会问我们，“PlanGrid能为我做早餐和晚餐吗？”当有大的总承包商，小的分包商和建筑业主问我们同样的按钮，告诉我们，“如果你有这个东西，它会为我节省很多时间，”而且团队中有足够的领域经验。当如此多的客户要求同样的东西时，它可能是正确的构建，尽管跟踪显然是很重要的。我们通常把它看作是，这有多难构建？我们需要投入多少资源在这方面，而这会给我们的用户带来多大的价值和影响呢？如果这是低水平的努力和高影响，我们将优先考虑这一点。这确实帮助我们指导了我们的产品路线图。

Jason Lemkin: Have you had any of your bigger customers drag your roadmap in a different way  than your smaller customers?
Tracy: Yes, the larger customers, they want to be treated like princes and princesses, that they're  running our entire business. They're incredibly supportive of us.

杰森·莱姆金：你有没有让你的大客户以与你的小客户不同的方式拖动你的路线图？是的，更大的客户，他们想被当作王子和公主对待，他们经营着我们的整个业务。他们非常支持我们。

It's nice that not any single  one customer has that big of a percentage of our revenue. They just want to  make sure that we're listening to them and that we're showing them what the future  of PlanGrid looks like, and that we're constantly improving it, because they're not only buying  PlanGrid today, but they're buying PlanGrid six months from now.

很好，没有一个客户拥有如此大的百分比我们的收入。他们只是想确保我们在倾听他们的意见，我们向他们展示了PlanGrid的未来，并且我们在不断地改进它，因为他们不仅在今天购买PlanGrid，而且从现在起的6个月后也在购买PlanGrid。

It's a commitment, it's a  relationship.

这是一种承诺，这是一种关系。

Jason Lemkin: It's a long term commitment. How many customers total, to you have at PlanGrid?
Tracy: Tens of thousands.

杰森·莱姆金：这是一个长期的承诺。你在PlanGrid有多少客户？数万人。

Jason Lemkin: Tens of thousands. But the revenue distribution, it's probably several orders to magnitude at your  biggest customers. Even if it's a couple percent of revenue, or even in the early  days, when they ask you to build something that's kind of on your roadmap, that's  way out there because this is an issue we all face, do you build it?  The B2C guys all say no, right? But when your big customer wants you to  build a 2019 feature, do you build it?
Tracy: Again, if there's a ton of the big customers asking us for the same thing,  it's easy to prioritize that, but we have never built a feature out for just  one customer. That doesn't make sense. We're building software for the construction industry, not XYZ  construction.

杰森·莱姆金：数以万计。但收入分配，可能是几个数量级在您的最大客户。即使这是收入的几%，甚至在早期，当他们要求你在你的路线图上建立某种东西的时候，这就是出路，因为这是一个我们都面临的问题，你会建立它吗？B2C的人都说不，对吧？但是当你的大客户想要你构建一个2019年的功能时，你会构建它吗？特雷西：再一次，如果有大量的大客户要求我们做同样的事情，那么很容易优先考虑这个问题，但是我们从来没有为一个客户建立过一个功能。那也太没道理了我们正在为建筑业开发软件，而不是XYZ建筑。

Jason Lemkin: Got it. Harry, Lob, is there a difference between different size customers, on product, what  they want?
Harry: Definitely a big difference between large and small customers. We spent a lot of time  focusing on the larger customers. One thing you mentioned earlier, do our large customers impact  our roadmap? They certainly do. That said, I think it's also about being transparent in  the conversation from the first deal, like, what are you building? You're not just selling  one particular feature or one particular item.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。哈利，洛布，不同尺寸的顾客在产品上有什么不同吗？他们想要什么？哈里：大客户和小客户之间肯定有很大的区别。我们花了很多时间在更大的客户身上。你之前提到的一件事是，我们的大客户会影响我们的路线图吗？他们当然知道。话虽如此，我认为这也是关于在第一笔交易的谈话中保持透明，比如，你在建造什么？你不只是卖一个特定的功能或一个特定的项目。

It's a roadmap. You're investing in Lob, You're  going to be building infrastructure on that. We need to talk to that roadmap and  when larger customers are purchasing, they're looking at what are we building six months from  now, trying to understand what that is. For us, it's about finding the balance between  the type of customers that we want, and listening to those customers a little bit  more that are more strategic. For us, we're selling something that's very ubiquitous. Mail comes  in many shapes, formats, sizes, and there's literally endless amounts of combinations that we could  do, and if we entertained every single request, we would end up going a million  directions all the time. For us, we focus very strategically on operational mail, mail that  customers are compliant and required to send, as opposed to marketing mail. That's not to  say we don't do a lot of marketing mail. We still do, but when we  think about roadmap conversations and it comes to a trade off between A or B,  we're always going to look at the customer who, one, we have a relationship with,  two is the direction that we want the company to move to begin with. That's  how we prioritize it. Sometimes that means saying "no" to the customer, and oftentimes we've  found their okay with that, so long as you're transparent about what you're trying to  do.

这是路线图。如果你投资于LOB，你将在此基础上建设基础设施。我们需要与路线图对话，当更大的客户购买时，他们正在研究我们在6个月后正在建设什么，试图了解这是什么。对我们来说，这是为了在我们想要的客户类型之间找到平衡，并且更多地倾听那些更具战略性的客户。对我们来说，我们是在卖一些无处不在的东西。邮件有很多的形状、格式、大小，我们可以做到的组合是无穷无尽的，如果我们处理每一个请求，我们最终会一直走到一百万个方向。对我们来说，我们非常注重运营邮件，客户遵从和要求发送的邮件，而不是营销邮件。这并不是说我们不做很多营销邮件。我们仍然是这样做的，但当我们考虑到路线图的对话时，谈到A或B之间的权衡时，我们总是会关注客户，第一，我们与之有关系，第二个是我们希望公司开始行动的方向。这就是我们优先考虑的方式。有时候，这意味着对客户说“不”，而且我们经常会发现他们对此没有意见，只要你对你想要做的事情保持透明。

Jason Lemkin: Yeah. You said in the beginning, you guys were five co-founders for two years, right?
Harry: No.

杰森·莱姆金：是的。你刚开始的时候说，你们做了两年的联合创始人，对吧？哈利：没有。

Jason Lemkin: Roughly? I had that wrong?
Harry: No, I think I heard five co-founders.

杰森·莱姆金：大概吧？我错了？哈里：不，我想我听到了五位联合创始人的声音。

Jason Lemkin: Oh, is it Tracy five?
Harry: Yeah.

杰森·莱姆金：哦，是特蕾西五岁吗？哈利：是的。

Jason Lemkin: Well, we'll get into equity splits later.

杰森·莱姆金：好吧，我们稍后再进行股权分割。

Harry: Okay.

哈利：好的。

Jason Lemkin: Then at 51 'till I learn how that ... But anyhow, related questions.

杰森·莱姆金：然后在51岁的时候，我才知道那是怎么回事.但是无论如何，相关的问题。

I want  to ask most of the panel this. As you scale, let's talk about ... Because  this is always a great learning, a mis-hire. As you get out of our core  team, is there a core functional area, or VP, or someone that you thought you  needed or got wrong in the early days? Anything you can learn from? What's the  biggest hiring mistake that you made?
Harry: I don't know about the biggest, but we made a lot.

我想问小组的大多数成员这个问题。当你扩大规模的时候，让我们谈谈.因为这总是一种伟大的学习，一种错误的雇佣。当你走出我们的核心团队时，是否有一个核心职能领域，或副总裁，或者你认为你在早期需要或出错的人？你能从中学到什么吗？你犯的最大的招聘错误是什么？哈利：我不知道什么是最大的，但我们赚了很多。

Jason Lemkin: Most visceral. (laughs)
Harry: We made a lot, I don't know anyone who hasn't.

杰森·莱姆金：最发自内心的。(笑)哈利：我们赚了很多，我不知道谁没有。

Jason Lemkin: Yes, but we can learn from this to the next generation ...

杰森·莱姆金：是的，但我们可以从这一点向下一代学习.

Harry: Yeah, we can.

哈利：是的，我们可以。

Jason Lemkin: Make this mistake fewer times.

杰森·莱姆金：少犯这个错误。

Harry: Yeah, I think the biggest challenge is, once you grow into a fullfledged company, you  grow outside of you zone of comfort.

哈利：是的，我认为最大的挑战是，一旦你成长为一家成熟的公司，你就会在舒适区之外成长。

If you're in the technical and product side,  then you have to hire business people.

如果你是在技术和产品方面，那么你必须雇用业务人员。

If you're on the business side, you have  to hire more technical and product leadership, and it's things that, at some point, you  don't know, and you don't know what you don't know.

如果你是在商业方面，你必须雇用更多的技术和产品领导，在某些时候，你不知道，也不知道你不知道什么。

I remember as an engineer  hiring non-engineers, it was very difficult for me because I knew I needed help, but  I didn't have the know-how to distinguish the different kinds of non-engineers that I needed.  It seems really silly to say that, but to me, marketing and sales was the  not coding thing. Also, I moved to the US from France, and Americans are extremely  good at selling themselves.

我记得作为一名雇用非工程师的工程师，这对我来说是非常困难的，因为我知道我需要帮助，但我不知道如何区分我需要的不同类型的非工程师。这么说似乎很愚蠢，但对我来说，营销和销售是不编码的。另外，我从法国搬到美国，美国人非常擅长推销自己。

Jason Lemkin: I hear that a lot from European founders.

杰森·莱姆金：我从欧洲创始人那里听说了很多。

I hear that as a consistent theme  with you.

我听说这是和你保持一致的主题。

Harry: You're right here and you meet 10 people, like, "Wow, these are all rock stars  ...

哈利：你就在这里，你遇到了10个人，比如，“哇，这些都是摇滚明星.

Jason Lemkin: Or to PlanGrid and Box and you're just going to hire them right then and  there, don't you?
Harry: And you do, and then you realize there's more to this. The biggest problem is,  when you hire the wrong person, the state of mind is, "Oh, it's a bad  person, they're bad, and my company's good, and now I hired the bad person." But  really, what's happening is, everyone's wasting your time.

杰森·莱姆金：或者去PlanGrid和Box，你会马上雇佣他们，不是吗？哈利：你知道，然后你就会意识到还有更多的事情要做。最大的问题是，当你雇用错误的人时，你的心态是，“哦，这是个坏人，他们是坏人，我的公司很好，现在我雇用了坏人。”但实际上，发生的是，每个人都在浪费你的时间。

It's not the right combination of people.  You're going to find out six months later and it's going to be a terrible  nuisance.

这不是人的正确组合。六个月后你会发现，这将是一个可怕的麻烦。

I don't really know if I've learned anything how to avoid it, but every  time we've made a mistake, we've tried to really invest the time to go back  and find out why, what we did wrong, so we don't make the same mistake  twice, honestly.

我真的不知道我是否学会了如何避免它，但是每次我们犯了一个错误，我们都试着投入时间回去，找出原因，我们做错了什么，所以我们不会犯两次同样的错误，老实说。

Jason Lemkin: It's not the hire's fault, it's your fault, isn't it?
Harry: Yeah. Exactly. That's exactly right. My feeling is, it's the hardest in the beginning, but  once you have a core group of people, like five key people in areas that  you don't really understand and master, but you build a relationship of trust with those  people, then it gets easier because you trust them to hire more people. The really  bad situation is if you don't sort out that stuff early on, like you make  a hire. You feel like it may be a bad hire, but you don't deal  with it right away, you allow it to fester, and then before you know it,  you're growing and that person has hired 20 more people, and now you're in big  trouble, because now you gotta deal with a mismatch potentially with 20 people. My only  advice would be, you're going to make mistakes, just deal with them early and listen  to your gut.

杰森·莱姆金：这不是雇工的错，是你的错，不是吗？哈利：是的。一点儿没错完全正确。我的感觉是，这在一开始是最困难的，但是一旦你有了一群核心的人，比如你不太了解和掌握的领域里的五个关键人物，但是你和这些人建立起信任的关系，那么你就会变得更容易，因为你相信他们会雇佣更多的人。真正糟糕的情况是，如果你不尽早解决这些问题，就像你雇了一个人一样。你觉得这可能是一份糟糕的工作，但你不能马上处理，你让它恶化，然后在你意识到之前，你在成长，而那个人又雇佣了20个人，现在你遇到了大麻烦，因为现在你必须处理一个可能与20个人不匹配的问题。我唯一的建议是，你会犯错误，只要早点处理，听从你的直觉。

If your gut says, "Oh, maybe this is the wrong thing," trust  yourself, even if it's not your field of expertise.

如果你的直觉说，“哦，也许这是错误的事情，”相信你自己，即使这不是你的专业领域。

I'm probably repeating common sense here,  but ...

我可能是在重复常识，但是.

Jason Lemkin: We all make the same mistake. Tracy, I want to hear you're story too, but  let me flip it around. You have five co-founders, right? You probably have a lot  of the ... You felt like you had at least two of the bases covered  in the early days, at least in theory. What was one of these early hires  that the you made that was extremely impactful, that moved the needle, that helped increase  the business?
Tracy: Our employee number one.

杰森·莱姆金：我们都犯了同样的错误。特蕾西，我也想听你讲故事，但让我把它翻过来。你有五个联合创始人，对吧？你可能有很多.。你觉得在早期你至少有两个基地，至少在理论上是这样的。你所做的这些早期雇佣中，有什么是非常有影响力的，它触动了针头，帮助增加了生意？特蕾西：我们的第一雇员。

Jason Lemkin: Employee number one. Who was that?
Tracy: Just because there was just ... Cory Lorenz ... Early on, there's nothing and you  have to build something from nothing. The more people that we can get on to  the team to help realize our mission as a company is incredibly important, and I  would say the same about employee number two, employee number three, employee number 300.

杰森·莱姆金：一号员工。那是谁？就因为有.。科里·洛伦兹。一开始，什么都没有，你必须从一无所有中构建一些东西。我们能接触到更多的人来帮助实现我们作为一家公司的使命是非常重要的，我想说的是，第二名，第三名，第300号员工也是如此。

Jason Lemkin: Was there a particular functional area or someone that changed things for you? They're all  great.

杰森·莱姆金：有没有一个特定的功能区或某个人为你改变了一切？他们都很棒。

Tracy: We brought them on because we needed help. So, it's hard to just pinpoint one  person.

特蕾西：我们让他们来是因为我们需要帮助。所以，很难找到一个人。

Jason Lemkin: For sure. Well, let me ask a different question. You have five founders. When do  you bring on VP's or directors or others to take over the functional areas from  them? What did you learn from that experience?
Tracy: The point when we realized that we, as being a founder especially doing it for  the first time, so much of our jobs is just learning on the spot and  trying to get the job done. As we've recruited more people to team, there comes  a point where it's like, "Wow, we have to become really good at managing people.  This is all new for the founders.

杰森·莱姆金：当然。好吧，让我问一个不同的问题。你有五个创始人。你什么时候请副总裁或董事或其他人接管他们的职能领域？你从那次经历中学到了什么？特蕾西：当我们意识到，作为一个创办者，尤其是第一次这样做的时候，我们的许多工作只是当场学习，并努力完成任务。随着我们招募更多的人加入团队，总有一天会有这样的感觉：“哇，我们必须变得非常善于管理人员，这对创始人来说都是全新的。”

I think we got really good at it,  especially as just the frontline engineering manager, but there comes a point where we're at  50 people, 150 people, and it's like Dunbar's number.

我认为我们在这方面做得很好，尤其是作为一线工程经理，但总有一天我们只有50人，150人，这就像邓巴的数字。

It's complete chaos. Suddenly communication gets  so much harder, and I think that's when we started layering in executives who had  done it before, because now we have the experience of people who aren't like the  founders, who aren't learning on the job, they've done it before, they've done it three  times before, very successfully, and it's just much easier to run the business that way.

完全混乱。突然间，沟通变得更加困难，我想这就是我们开始对以前做过的高管进行分层的时候，因为现在我们有了一些人的经验，他们不像创始人，他们没有在工作中学习，他们以前做过三次，成功地做过三次，而这样经营企业就容易多了。

Jason Lemkin: Yeah, that's a good insight of when ... We all want to hire the folks  who've done it before early. Not all of us, but we get attracted to the  box on the resume. But maybe that Dunbar number's the right time to think about  it, right? When did you benefit from folks that maybe weren't as fluent in the  product but were fluent in the processes?
Tracy: Yeah, if I could do it over, I would probably bring them on earlier, but  at that point, it's just like you're trying to recruit someone who's very, very good  at their jobs, who are getting paid tons of money at wherever they're at, and  it's hard to recruit them to your little shit startup. You sell you're butts off.  Actually you never stop selling you're butts of about your mission, your vision as a  company, and so being able to deliver that message of what you're trying to do,  and also, showing the traction, showing the growth, when you see that graph, everyone wants  to be a part of it.

杰森·莱姆金：是的，这是一个很好的洞察力，什么时候.我们都想雇用以前做过这件事的人。不是所有人，但我们被简历上的盒子吸引住了。但也许邓巴号是考虑这个问题的合适时机，对吧？你什么时候受益于那些不太熟悉产品，但对流程却很流利的人呢？特蕾西：是的，如果我能重来一遍，我可能会更早地把他们招出来，但在那个时候，就像你想招聘一个非常擅长于他们工作的人，他们在任何地方都能得到很多钱，而且很难在你的小公司里招募他们。你卖了你的屁股。事实上，你从来没有停止过推销你的使命，你作为一个公司的愿景，所以能够传达出你想要做的事情的信息，同时，展示你的吸引力，展示增长，当你看到那个图表时，每个人都想成为它的一部分。

Jason Lemkin: They do, yeah. Recruiting is always hard, but was there a moment when it got  easier?
Tracy: Practice. Practicing gets easier, so, I'd say maybe ...

杰森·莱姆金：是的。招聘总是很困难的，但有什么时候变得容易了吗？练习。练习变得容易了，所以，我想说也许.

Jason Lemkin: From a brand perspective, did PlanGrid get to the point, did Sequoia or others, or  Press, or you ...

杰森·莱姆金：从品牌的角度来看，PlanGrid是说到重点了吗，红杉还是其他人，出版社，还是你.

I want to ask a related question, but did it get,  in some way, easier when you became a more interesting startup to a broader community?
Tracy: Yeah, so we're a YC company, we're also in the Sequoia portfolio. We flashed that  to our advantage.

我想问一个相关的问题，但在某种程度上，当你成为一个更有趣的社区创业公司时，它会变得更容易吗？是的，所以我们是一家YC公司，我们也在红杉投资组合中。我们闪现了这个优势。

Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Good. Harry, any learnings on hiring mistakes or a great hire you made that  moved the needle for you?
Harry: Yeah.

杰森·莱姆金：是的。好的哈利，你学到了什么关于雇佣错误的经验吗？哈利：是的。

It's like I should talk to one. You mentioned it earlier, realizing that you  need to hire good managers, it's a big moment for us in the past couple  of years. That was actually one of the early mistakes we made, which was one  of our best IC's, I thought he wanted to be a manager, and we really  wanted him to manage a team too. He hadn't actually had experience doing that before,  and when we put him in that role, he struggled. That put us through a  tough six months.

好像我应该和一个人谈谈。你之前提到过，意识到你需要雇佣优秀的经理，这对我们来说是过去几年的一个重要时刻。这实际上是我们早期犯的错误之一，这是我们最好的IC之一，我以为他想成为一名经理，我们真的希望他也能管理一个团队。他以前没有这样的经验，当我们让他担任这个角色时，他很挣扎。这让我们度过了艰难的六个月。

I think we learned a lesson early on,.

我想我们很早就吸取了教训。

It's like you want  people who have already done it once before, because even though you may trust somebody  and they're awesome at what they do, it's hard to discount the value of experience.  That's something, having seen it before, the type of problems you can see, that's made  a big difference. For us, I could say, first most huge hire, it's like we  had somebody in a managing role that didn't pan out and our second head of  engineering was just incredible. He literally made problems disappear. Things that we would sit there  and worry about, I'd be up there with my co-founder talking about this and this  people issue, and next thing we knew, literally three weeks after he started, we just  never talked about it or heard about it again. Everyone seemed to be happy and  working harder and staying longer and we didn't really think we were doing anything different.  We just had somebody different on the roll.

就像你想要那些已经做过一次的人，因为即使你可能相信某个人，他们在他们所做的事情上是很棒的，但很难低估经验的价值。这是一件很重要的事情，因为你以前看到过，你能看到的问题类型，这是一个很大的改变。对我们来说，我可以说，首先是最庞大的雇用，就像我们有一个管理的角色，但没有成功，我们的第二个工程主管是难以置信的。他真的让问题消失了。我们坐在那里担心的事情，我会和我的联合创始人谈论这个和这个人的问题，接下来我们知道的事情，在他开始的三个星期之后，我们就再也没有谈论过，也没有听说过。每个人似乎都很快乐，工作更努力，工作时间更长，我们并没有觉得我们做了什么不同的事情。我们刚刚有个不一样的人。

Jason Lemkin: How quickly did you know? 30 days?
Harry: What's that?
Jason Lemkin: How quickly did you know it was impactful? An hour?
Harry: We had the advantage of already having someone on the roll, so we knew what  good looked like and what great was. Obviously, we're always looking at that, but in  the first 30 days, I think you can immediately tell the difference they're having at  the team. Even within the first ... The first two weeks is a lot of  learning, and you can just tell from the quality of the questions that they're asking.  What are they thinking about, how far they are planning ahead. Then, really, we started  seeing a lot of changes happen the second week in terms of taking everything they  learned throughout the interview process, getting to know the company, and also adopting it to  their own style.

杰森·莱姆金：你知道得有多快？30天？哈利：那是什么？杰森·莱姆金：你多快就知道这是有影响的？一个小时？哈利：我们的优势是我们已经有了一个人，所以我们知道什么是好的样子，什么是伟大的。很明显，我们一直在关注这一点，但在前30天，我想你可以立即看出他们在球队中的不同之处。即使在第一个.。最初的两周是大量的学习，你可以从他们提出的问题的质量来判断。他们在想什么，他们在计划多远。然后，实际上，我们开始看到在第二周发生了很多变化，他们在面试过程中学到了一切，了解了公司，也采用了自己的风格。

I think, first and foremost, not just hiring for experience but hiring  for a culture fit is really, really important. We had great hires in the past,  awesome IC's that we let fester a little too long because of cultural things, and  having to rewind that back and a few years later it was definitely challenging.

我认为，首先也是最重要的是，不仅招聘经验，而且雇用一个适合的文化是非常重要的。我们曾经有过大量的员工，令人敬畏的IC，因为文化的原因，我们让它腐烂得太久了，而且不得不把它倒回去，几年后，它肯定是很有挑战性的。

I  think culture fit now, we spend a ton of time throughout the interview process. We've  updated our values, worked into the interview process, each person is responsible for asking one  particular component of that. That's one of the first things we evaluate, regardless of whether  or not the person can do their job.

我认为文化适合现在，我们花了大量的时间在整个面试过程。我们更新了我们的价值观，在面试过程中，每个人都有责任询问其中的一个特定部分。这是我们首先评估的事情之一，不管这个人是否能胜任他们的工作。

It's like, "Is this someone we'd work  with? Is this someone who's going to fit well, and really bring their own individual  skillset to the company?"
Jason Lemkin: Yeah, that's a good point. Tracy, let me go back to a point you made  about the journey that your customers are signing up for six and 12 months, maybe  their even signing up for 60 months and 100 months. Especially in the early days,  products are super feature poor. You had 29 folks sign up immediately, but it's still  feature ... How do you convince them to go on that journey when you have  incumbents that are feature rich? What have you learned?
Tracy: There's nothing like adoption in the field. There're certainly lots of incumbents, some that you  know very well. There's also a lot of startups here that are just, if you  have any success at all, your software will be copied because they're dealing with that  right now. Just making sure that we are developing products that are actually being used  in the field has been key to PlanGrid's success. Regardless of what VP of Operations  or CIOs want to deploy, the software that's being used on construction site, for real,  is our software because we made sure we were building software for the superintendents and  foremen, and carpenters, and electricians, in a way that is actually powerful to them, that  actually helps them do their jobs better.

就像，“这是一个我们会合作的人吗？这个人会很好地适应公司，并真正为公司带来自己的个人技能吗？”杰森·莱姆金：是的，这点很好。特蕾西，让我回到你的旅程，你的客户注册了6个月和12个月，也许他们甚至注册了60个月和100个月。特别是在早期，产品性能很差。你马上就有29个人注册了，但它还是有特色的.你是如何说服他们继续这一旅程的，当你的现任者是特色丰富的？你学到了什么？特蕾西：在这个领域里没有什么比收养更好的了。当然有很多在任者，有些你很熟悉。这里也有很多创业公司，如果你成功了，你的软件就会被复制，因为他们现在正在处理这个问题。仅仅是确保我们正在开发实际应用于该领域的产品，一直是PlanGrid成功的关键。不管运营部门的副总裁或首席信息官想要部署什么样的软件，在建筑工地上使用的软件实际上都是我们的软件，因为我们确保我们为总监、工头、木匠和电工建造了软件，这种软件实际上对他们很有帮助，有助于他们更好地工作。

Jason Lemkin: This is learning from me, but a lot of your history is coming in from  the field, even if the CIO's office, whoever it is, maybe ...

杰森·莱姆金：这是在向我学习，但是你的很多历史都是从现场来的，即使首席信息官的办公室，不管是谁，也许.

Tracy: We build software for them too, so we've got admin panels, we have SSO coming  out for them, we've got beautiful graphs and stuff because they are a decision maker,  and that's important to us.

特蕾西：我们也为他们制作软件，所以我们有管理面板，我们有SSO，我们有漂亮的图形和东西，因为他们是决策者，这对我们来说很重要。

I think early days, first four years of PlanGrid, we  were definitely not prioritizing products for the people in the office.

我认为，在PlanGrid成立的最初四年里，我们绝对没有为办公室里的人优先考虑产品。

Jason Lemkin: Let's just talk about that for a minute, because that's always interesting. You get in  through the field, they love the product, they can adopt it immediately instead of taking  six months. How did you deal with that conflict, if a different vendor had already  been selected by procurement or ... Any learnings on how to deal with that
Tracy: Yeah, our industry is super interesting, because we essentially sell to construction projects. There's certainly  construction companies that managed several projects at the time, but the beauty of our industry,  and it's both the the best and worst thing, is when we're in a construction  project, there's actually 50 different costumers for us to sell to. There are the carpenters,  there's electricians, there's the concrete folks, the pool installers, the paint person. There's this natural  virality that happens within construction projects. The foreman starts using PlanGrid, and it's a cultural  thing too. As a construction person, you just want to show off your shiny new  tool. PlanGrid is so cool that you want to be the first one to show  everyone else on the project. We were always laser focused at building something that was  easy to adopt, easy to use, and that would spark that network effect within construction  projects. Here's corporate standardizing on a software, then you've got the field which the person  really paying for it is the building owner. We've been just laser focused at getting  our software adopted at the ground level, which is very different than any other software  in this space.

杰森·莱姆金：让我们讨论一下这个问题，因为这总是很有趣的。你进入这个领域，他们喜欢这个产品，他们可以立即采用它，而不是花六个月的时间。你是如何处理这一冲突的，如果另一家供应商已经通过采购或.任何关于如何处理特蕾西的知识：是的，我们的行业非常有趣，因为我们基本上是卖给建筑项目的。当然，当时有一些建筑公司管理着几个项目，但我们这个行业的美妙之处在于，当我们参与一个建筑项目时，实际上有50个不同的客户可以卖给我们，这是最好的，也是最糟糕的。有木匠，电工，混凝土工人，泳池安装工，油漆工。在建筑工程中有一种自然的病毒。工头开始使用PlanGrid，这也是一个文化问题。作为一个建筑人，你只是想炫耀你闪亮的新工具。PlanGrid是如此的酷，以至于您希望成为第一个在这个项目中向其他人展示的人。我们总是把注意力集中在建设一些易于采用，易于使用，并会在建设项目中引发网络效应的项目上。这里是一个软件的公司标准化，然后你得到的领域，真正的人支付它是业主。我们只是专注于让我们的软件在地面上被采用，这与这个领域中的任何其他软件都有很大的不同。

Jason Lemkin: You spent a lot of time on those other users that actually don't pay for  PlanGrid? All the other folks on the project, how do you make them happy too?
Tracy: We made sure to build something that was flexible enough that could be used by  anyone in the architectural engineering and construction industry. Prioritizing product is a key factor here.  We didn't want to build something that was just for one profile. We wanted it  to be flexible enough that it could be used by everyone in the industry.

杰森·莱姆金：你花了很多时间在那些实际上不为PlanGrid付费的其他用户身上？在这个项目上的所有其他人，你如何使他们也快乐？特蕾西：我们确保建造的东西足够灵活，可供建筑工程和建筑行业的任何人使用。对产品进行排序是这里的一个关键因素。我们不想只为了一个侧面而建东西。我们希望它具有足够的灵活性，使它能够被业界的每一个人所使用。

Jason Lemkin: Yeah. Solomon, let's talk a variant of this sort of competition along the journey for  you.

杰森·莱姆金：是的。所罗门，让我们谈谈这类竞争的变体。

I feel like Docker is a product and a vendor that people are rooting  for.

我觉得码头是一个产品和供应商，人们支持。

I think there are a lot of the Docker fans, I would say. How  do you invest in that? How do you return that social contract on the product  side, especially as competition increases? As you prove yourself, everyone wants to do something in  the broad container market. Competition's everywhere. How do you keep that 100 NPS That Docker  probably has?
Solomon: Yeah,
Jason Lemkin: Do you measure NPS?
Solomon: We measure NPS, yes.

我想有很多码头球迷，我会说。你是怎么投资的？你如何在产品方面返回社会契约，特别是在竞争加剧的情况下？正如你所证明的那样，每个人都想在广阔的集装箱市场上有所作为。竞争无处不在。你如何保存码头可能拥有的100个核动力源？是的，杰森·莱姆金：你测量NPS吗？所罗门：我们测量NPS，是的。

Jason Lemkin: Happiness?
Solomon: We do. The problem for us is, who do we ask? Because there's a lot  of different audiences. Actually, it's a really interesting comparison ...

杰森·莱姆金：幸福？所罗门：我们知道。我们的问题是，我们该问谁？因为有很多不同的观众。实际上，这是一个非常有趣的比较.。

I think the same thing  is happening in a lot of industries. There was this sort of bottom up, go  to market where first you get the practitioners on board, and then you get their  bosses on board maybe later. Maybe they learn about your product only once ... Dozens  or hundreds of people in their organization are using it.

我认为在很多行业也发生了同样的事情。有一种自下而上的方式，去市场，先让从业者上船，然后再让他们的老板上船。也许他们只了解你的产品一次.。在他们的组织中，数十或数百人正在使用它。

Jason Lemkin: Even today at Docker?
Solomon: Yeah. So we use that ...

杰森·莱姆金：即使是今天在码头？所罗门：是的。所以我们用这个.。

Jason Lemkin: Do you use a rogue app in some
Solomon: We use that heavily, yes. Today, as a business, we target enterprises, very large businesses.  That is our focus. We sell also to small businesses. We're kind of in a  similar situation. You've got the tens of thousands, and then the majority of the revenue  comes from a few hundred. All of them are in this relationship with us as  a vendor because someone on their team at some point said, "New app, awesome Docker,  I want to meet up, sounds great," or, "I saw a discussion online about it."  We owe everything to that, to the community, and there's a lot of positive vibes  in that community. Honestly, it's pretty insane if you've ever been to a Docker meetup,  or we've just had DockerCon ...

杰森·莱姆金：你有没有在一些所罗门中使用流氓应用：我们用的太多了，是的。今天，作为一个企业，我们的目标是企业，非常大的企业。这是我们的重点。我们也销售给小企业。我们的情况也差不多。你有成千上万的收入，然后大部分收入来自几百。他们都和我们有着这样的关系，因为他们团队中的某个人说，“新应用程序，很棒的码头客，我想认识一下，听起来不错，”或者，“我在网上看到了一个关于这个问题的讨论。”我们把一切都归功于这个社区，在这个社区里有很多积极的气氛。老实说，如果你去过码头聚会，或者我们刚开过码头会议，那就太疯狂了.

Jason Lemkin: We had DockerCon. That was like 5,000 people. Right?
Solomon: It's ridiculous.

杰森·莱姆金：我们有码头公司。大概有5000人。对吗？太荒谬了。

Jason Lemkin: In the early days, how do you facilitate that? What are the learnings? How do  you get that flywheel going?
Solomon: Honestly, we started something very small, and we showed it to a few people one  by one. Then, 10 of them came back to our office saying, "Hey, we want  to know more." It was just the most fun three hours of my life. Basically  we're just talking about all the cool stuff we could build at Docker and then  they came back the week after that and it was 40 people, then it was  100. That was the first week of the existence of Docker. Right away, we saw,  okay, there's something special going on here, and there's a community forming, and they're basically  saying, "Hey, you, the company you started this, you're the janitor now. Organize things for  us, because this is our thing now." We just took that job really seriously of  enabling that community to do whatever it decides to do. We've been following that community  ever since, and just removing obstacles for that community to grow, do more things together.  We have a whole team just focused on that, just enabling the community. We have  all these cool programs, we have, I think, 120 meetups in the world, 100,000 people  have
Jason Lemkin: 120 meetups a year. All right.

杰森·莱姆金：在早期，你是如何促进这一点的？学到了什么？飞轮是怎么开的？所罗门：老实说，我们开始做一些很小的事情，然后一个地把它给几个人看。然后，他们中的10人回到我们的办公室说：“嘿，我们想知道更多。”这是我生命中最有趣的三个小时。基本上，我们只是在谈论我们在Docker可以建造的所有很酷的东西，然后他们在那之后的一周回来了，当时是40个人，然后是100人。那是“码头工人”存在的第一周。我们马上就看到了，好吧，这里发生了一些特别的事情，有一个社区正在形成，他们基本上在说，“嘿，你创办的公司，你现在是看门人。为我们组织一些事情，因为这是我们现在的事情。”我们只是认真地对待这一工作，使社区能够做它决定做的任何事情。从那时起，我们就一直在关注这个社区，只是为社区的发展扫清障碍，一起做更多的事情。我们整个团队都在关注这个问题，只是让社区受益而已。我们有所有这些很酷的项目，我想，我们在世界上有120次会议，10万人有JasonLemkin：每年有120次会议。好的

Solomon: No, so it's 120 locations in the world, each with an average of a meetup  every two months or so.

所罗门：没有，所以在世界上有120个地点，每个地点平均每两个月开一次会。

Jason Lemkin: Got it.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。

Solomon: Then 100,000 people, I think overall, have showed up at least once to one of  these meetups. There's a Captains program, which is sort of like elite power user, where  the most savvy and articulate users of Docker, we promote them and pay them for  them to go and speak at events and they just become these stars in the  community.

所罗门：我认为，总共有10万人至少出席了一次这样的会议。有一个船长项目，有点像精英的超级用户，在那里，最精明、最清晰的码头用户，我们向他们推销，并付钱给他们，让他们在活动中发言，而他们只是成为了社区中的明星。

It's a huge investment for us, but all of it is about giving back.

这对我们来说是一笔巨大的投资，但都是为了回报。

Jason Lemkin: Got it. How many of these captains are there, out of curiosity?
Solomon: I think now there's maybe 20, 30.

杰森·莱姆金：明白了。出于好奇，这些船长中有多少人在那里？所罗门：我想现在大概有二三十个了。

It's a small number.

这是一个很小的数目。

Jason Lemkin: Probably sounds like a lot to some of us.

杰森·莱姆金：对我们中的一些人来说，这听起来可能很像。

It's a lot of captains.

很多船长。

Solomon: It's a lot of captains.

所罗门：有很多船长。

Jason Lemkin: But you said you had 400 employees.

杰森·莱姆金：但你说你有400名员工。

I mean, they're not employees, but it's a  significant amount of your extended family. Right?
Solomon: Correct. When you see a community, when you see anyone super excited about what you're  doing, just drop everything you're doing and make sure you put themselves at their service.  In our case it's the developers using an open source tool, but it looks like  there's something similar going on.

我是说，他们不是雇员，但这是你大家庭的一个重要组成部分。对吗？所罗门：对。当你看到一个社区，当你看到任何人对你正在做的事情非常兴奋的时候，放下你正在做的每一件事，确保你为他们服务。在我们的例子中，是开发人员使用了开源工具，但是看起来有类似的事情发生。

I'm sure there's ...

我肯定有.。

I'm going to say it wrong,  but whatever the job is of someone actually working at a construction site, some of  them, I'm sure, are just huge fans of the tool. They go everywhere and they  tell all their buddies about it, and I think that's how consumer products used to  grow.

我要说错了，但不管是在建筑工地工作的人做什么，他们中的一些人，我肯定，只是这个工具的巨大粉丝。他们到处走，把这件事告诉了所有的朋友，我认为这就是消费品过去的增长方式。

It's increasingly seeing the best B2B products also grow that way.

它越来越多地看到最好的B2B产品也以这种方式增长。

Jason Lemkin: Let's make that our last question, because I want to save a few minutes for  questions so we have it. Related to that, I think I already know the answer  for Docker, so let's just do PlanGrid and Lob. Tracy, today, what percent of your  new customers come from word of mouth or brand, or ... All this great goodwill  that you've built across the industry, how does that pay off today?
Tracy: We definitely ship Facebook ads and stuff, but most of our new customers comes from  just word of mouth, organic growth, which is awesome, but then it's also uncontrollable, right?  It just comes naturally to us. We don't know what sparks it, but we know  that if we make our clients happy and we build great product for them that  that does continue to happen year after year.

杰森·莱姆金：让我们做最后一个问题，因为我想留出几分钟的时间来提问，这样我们就有了。与此相关，我想我已经知道了Docker的答案，所以让我们做PlanGrid和LOB吧。特蕾西，今天，你的新客户中有多少来自口碑或品牌，或者.所有这些伟大的善意，你已经建立了整个行业，这是如何回报今天？特蕾西：我们肯定会发布Facebook广告之类的东西，但我们的新客户大多来自口碑，有机增长，这是很棒的，但也是无法控制的，对吧？这对我们来说是很自然的。我们不知道是什么火花，但我们知道，如果我们让我们的客户高兴，我们为他们制造伟大的产品，这确实会继续发生年复一年。

Jason Lemkin: Is that happening at Lob yet? Are you getting most of your customers from the  base?
Harry: Yeah, our base customers are the folks that are referring a good portion of
Jason Lemkin: You're not having to send all the emails yourself today anymore.

杰森·莱姆金：那在洛布发生了吗？你的大部分顾客都是从基地来的吗？哈利：是的，我们的基本客户是指杰森·莱姆金的大部分人：你今天不用再自己发邮件了。

Harry: No. What we've actually found, similar to what Solomon was saying, one of the things  that's interesting, we have these folks that have been at three different companies in like  a four-year span, and have used Lob at three companies.

哈利：没有。我们发现，就像所罗门所说的，有趣的事情之一是，我们有这样的人，他们在三家不同的公司工作了近四年，并在三家公司使用了LOB。

Jason Lemkin: That's when you know it's working.

杰森·莱姆金：那时候你就知道它起作用了。

Harry: They bring us ...

他们带我们来.。

Jason Lemkin: Yeah, they keep bringing you in.

杰森·莱姆金：是的，他们一直把你带进来。

Harry: They bring us every single time.

哈利：他们每次都带我们来。

It's great, because every time I get email from  them it's like a different company it's like, "Hey, I want to bring you here."  I was like, "Great, I'd love to chat with you." You want those folks who  are going to be your evangelist, who love your product, everywhere they go they're going  to find a way to use you because they like it. That's really important and  that played a big part for some of our early customers going to different companies,  bringing us there, and then you also get the referrals, especially, what you want to  do is you want to create word of mouth. We found this to be very  successful at conferences, where we already have a good foundational layer of companies. So, for  us, like, FinTech and the LendingSpace is the big one. We're going out, we're out  to lend it, and our customers will bring their friends over. "Oh, yeah. These guys  are great." There's nothing like a positive referral from someone who's an existing customer to  somebody else that's doing something similar. That is part of the reason we go every  single year, and we sit there and smile, we host a customer appreciation event, and  eventually we would love to get to the point where we could do a Lob  Con, get a bunch of folks together.

这很棒，因为每次我收到他们的电子邮件，就像一个不同的公司，“嘿，我想带你来这里。”我说，“太好了，我很想和你聊天。”你想要那些将要成为你的传道者，喜欢你的产品的人，无论他们走到哪里，他们都会想办法利用你，因为他们喜欢你的产品。这是非常重要的，这对我们的一些早期客户来说是很重要的，他们会去不同的公司，把我们带到那里，然后你也会得到推荐，特别是，你想要做的是创造口碑。我们发现这是非常成功的会议，在那里我们已经有一个良好的基础层的公司。所以，对我们来说，像金融科技和兰丁空间是最大的。我们要出去，我们出去借，我们的客户会带他们的朋友过来。“哦，是的，这些家伙很棒”没有什么比从一个现有客户积极推荐给其他正在做类似事情的人更好了。这也是我们每年都去的原因之一，我们坐在那里微笑着，我们举办了一场客户感谢活动，最终我们会想要达到这样的程度，我们可以做一次Lob Con，让一群人在一起。

Jason Lemkin: You may be ready already, actually, I think. Right? You may be ready. All right,  We keep going on this, but let's take some questions. Anyone got any great questions  for the panel?
Audience: I was wondering what was one past experience that you think helped the most while  starting your own company?
Speaker 1: Jason, can you repeat the questions?
Jason Lemkin: I can. The question was, what was one ...

杰森·莱姆金：我想你可能已经准备好了。对吗？你可能已经准备好了。好吧，我们继续做下去，但让我们回答一些问题。有人有什么很棒的问题吗？观众：我在想，在你创办自己的公司的时候，你认为最有帮助的是什么过去的经历？演讲者1：杰森，你能重复这些问题吗？杰森·莱姆金：我可以。问题是，什么是.

I like redundancy.

我喜欢冗余。

I worry.

我担心。

I  like five nines of uptime. What was one experience prior to starting your company that  actually helped you get it off the ground?
Tracy: Two of the five co-founders of PlanGrid had built buildings before, and the other three  were building software. Just our ability to rally resources and people and build something together,  the ability to work together really helped us work in a startup together.

我喜欢五九的正常运行时间。在开始你的公司之前，有什么经历真正帮助你把它从地面上弄出来了？特雷西：PlanGrid的五位联合创始人中，有两位曾经建造过大楼，另外三位是建造软件。仅仅是我们的能力，团结资源和人员，共同建设一些东西，共同工作的能力，真正帮助我们在一个创业公司一起工作。

It just  feels like the medium's changed. For me, instead of concrete and brick, it's people and  code and more people.

只是感觉媒介变了。对我来说，不是混凝土和砖块，而是人和代码，还有更多的人。

Jason Lemkin: Do you think you could penetrate the industry with no domain expertise? I'm sure it's  been done, but what's your learning on domain expertise?
Tracy: I think it's possible, you just have to become an expert fast. Somehow you have  to compensate for it.

杰森·莱姆金：你认为你可以在没有领域专业知识的情况下打入这个行业吗？我相信它已经完成了，但是你在专业领域学到了什么呢？特蕾西：我认为这是可能的，你只需要快速成为一个专家。不知何故，你必须补偿它。

Harry: I can to comment on that a little bit.

哈利：我可以对此发表一点评论。

I didn't have any domain expertise  in mail.

我在邮件方面没有任何领域的专业知识。

I don't think a ton of people had domain expertise in mail.

我不认为有很多人在邮件中拥有领域的专业知识。

Tracy: You're an expert now, right?
Harry: I am an expert now, though, and certainly that's something I've learned. For me, past  experience ... When I came out of college, I went to Microsoft, and this is  the last place in the world you'd expect to send mail and have it be  effective. One of the projects I worked on there, for multiple different privacy reasons like  we're not allowed to email, we couldn't do it through the channel for another couple  of reasons, and my only option was either calling everybody, which didn't seem very feasible  at the time, or sending people these nice little kits.

特蕾西：你现在是专家了，对吗？哈利：不过，我现在是专家了，这当然是我学到的。对我来说过去的经历.。当我从大学毕业后，我去了微软，这是世界上最不可能寄出邮件并使之有效的地方。我在那里做过的一个项目，由于很多不同的隐私原因，比如我们不能发电子邮件，我们不能通过渠道通过其他几个原因，我唯一的选择是打电话给每个人，这在当时似乎不太可行，或者给人们发送这些漂亮的小工具。

It turns out the best  performing thing was mail.

结果证明最好的表演是邮件。

I ended up spending three months and hundreds of thousand dollars,  huge budgets, working on this and realizing that this is something people actually do, and  companies like Microsoft do every day and it works, but it's really hard and it's  ancient. We had people suggesting us automation, paying tens of thousands of dollars for implementation  to get an FTP folder that we drop an Excel file into.

最后，我花了三个月，几十万美元，巨额预算，在这个项目上工作，意识到这是人们真正做的事情，像微软这样的公司每天都这样做，而且很有效，但它真的很难，而且很古老。我们有人建议我们自动化，为实现支付数万美元，以获得一个FTP文件夹，我们将一个Excel文件放入其中。

It seems sort  of ridiculous but that was part of the inspiration for how we started working on  Lob.

这听起来有点可笑，但这是我们如何开始研究LOB的灵感之一。

Jason Lemkin: Go ahead.

杰森·莱姆金：去吧。

Audience: What are your thoughts about big companies who can offer a computing service or product  that can leverage their operations expertise, kind of like Amazon, for example?
Jason Lemkin: Yeah or let's say how do you deal with big companies that can do it  all? How do you deal with that situation?
Solomon: I think there's a generic answer that's true for every business for every startup and  then there's maybe some domain-specific answers. Personally, I think something that's true for all startups  is that you have focus and you have speed.

观众：你对那些能提供计算机服务或产品的大公司有什么看法，这些公司可以利用他们的运营专长，比如亚马逊(Amazon)？杰森·莱姆金：是啊，或者说，你是如何与那些能做到这一切的大公司打交道的呢？你是如何处理这种情况的？所罗门：我认为，对于每一家初创企业，都有一个通用的答案，这对每个企业都是正确的，然后可能会有一些特定于领域的答案。就我个人而言，我认为对所有初创企业来说，你都有专注和速度。

I had never worked at a  large company before, so I did not appreciate exactly the advantage we have as a  smaller company. Now, that we're growing a little bit, I can already tell what happens  when you grow. The goal really is to take advantage of our small size while  we're small faster than we accumulate problems as we grow. When you're big and you  have a successful business, everyone working there, the majority of people working there, first of  all, were not there at the time when the business became successful.

我以前从未在一家大公司工作过，所以我不太欣赏我们作为一家规模较小的公司所拥有的优势。现在，我们增长了一点，我已经知道当你成长的时候会发生什么。我们的目标是利用我们的小规模，而我们是小的，比我们积累问题的速度更快，随着我们的成长。当你很大，生意很成功的时候，在那里工作的每个人，大多数在那里工作的人，首先，当生意成功的时候，他们并不在那里。

It's long forgotten  how they became successful in the first place. They're administrating an existing cash cow. That's  a completely different kind of people, generally speaking, except maybe at the very top. You  got a few VPs that are the original guy who did it and then he's  running something, but usually these are people who, at your average large company, they're not  united as one group to make that company succeed against outside threats like you. They  are focused usually on their career. Are they going to get promoted? Are they going  to get more people under them? It's inside facing rather than outside facing. Most large  companies are like that and that's an advantage because they're not looking for threats. The  other advantage is focus. Large companies tend to be doing a lot of things and  when you're competing with a company who has 10,000 people and you have 10, it  might seem really daunting, but the particular parts of that company that is actually competing  with you, for all you know, might also be 10 people. They might be underfunded.  They might be on the wrong side of the big boss, who just doesn't care  about the product. Over time, as you start competing, you'll find out which ones are  serious threats and which ones are basically to be ignored.

人们早就忘记了他们最初是如何获得成功的。他们在管理一个现有的摇钱树。一般来说，这是一种完全不同的人，除了最上层的人。你有几个副总裁，他们是最初的那个人，然后他在经营一些东西，但通常这些人，在你一般的大公司里，他们并不是团结在一起，让公司战胜像你这样的外部威胁。他们通常专注于自己的事业。他们会升职吗？他们会让更多的人在他们下面吗？它是内面的，而不是外部的。大多数大公司都是这样的，这是一个优势，因为他们不寻求威胁。另一个优势是专注。大公司往往在做很多事情，当你和一家拥有1万人，而你有10个人的公司竞争的时候，你可能会觉得非常令人望而生畏，但就你所知，与你竞争的公司的特定部分也可能是10个人。他们可能资金不足。他们可能站在大老板的一边，他根本不关心产品。随着时间的推移，当你开始竞争时，你会发现哪些是严重的威胁，哪些基本上是被忽略的。

Jason Lemkin: It's hard to tell from the outside.

杰森·莱姆金：很难从外面看出来。

Solomon: Hard to tell, but as you start becoming an expert and you talk to customers,  it's pretty easy. Customers are going to say, "Well, I'm thinking about you and these  other two three things." Some names are going to come up a lot. Some of  them will be other startups. Some of them will be other big companies. Then, you  narrow down your focus and you figure out, "Okay, what makes that big company smarter  than the others?" You can break down the problem basically.

所罗门：很难说，但当你开始成为一名专家，与客户交谈时，这是相当容易的。顾客会说，“好吧，我在想你和另外两件事。”有些名字会出现很多。其中一些将是其他的初创公司。其中一些将是其他大公司。然后，你缩小了注意力范围，你发现，“好吧，是什么让这家大公司比其他公司更聪明呢？”基本上你可以解决这个问题。

Jason Lemkin: Go ahead.

杰森·莱姆金：去吧。

Audience: What do you think the biggest factors are that the customers to tell other customers  about your product?
Jason Lemkin: That's the magic question. What do you think the biggest factors are that create this  word of mouth, they get other customers to refer you out? What can you point  to specifically?
Tracy: The short answer's is good product, something that saves them time. At the end of  the day, that’s all we care about. We've got this one precious thing that we  don't get more of and because PlanGrid absolutely saves our users' time, it's why they've  told everyone else.

观众：你认为最大的因素是客户告诉其他客户你的产品吗？杰森·莱姆金：这是个神奇的问题。你认为最大的因素是什么创造了这个口碑，他们让其他客户推荐你？你能特别指出什么？特蕾西：简单的回答是好的产品，这样可以节省他们的时间。说到底，这就是我们所关心的。我们得到了一件我们没有得到更多的宝贵的东西，因为PlanGrid绝对节省了我们用户的时间，这就是为什么他们告诉其他人的原因。

Jason Lemkin: Let me just ... Harry, I'm going to ask you a variant of that question.  You had the great story of the customer that left, the 3x, that's a great  story, but in B2B it's hard for that to happen in three weeks, right?
Harry: Yeah.

杰森·莱姆金：让我.哈利，我要问你一个问题的变体。你有一个伟大的故事，客户离开，3x，这是一个伟大的故事，但在B2B，这是很难发生在三个星期，对吗？哈利：是的。

Jason Lemkin: How long did that take to get those three customers out of that first great  experience?
Harry: Yeah.

杰森·莱姆金：花了多长时间才让这三位顾客从第一次体验中解脱出来？哈利：是的。

I think the first thing I realized is customers aren't going to just, all  of a sudden, start referring them to you. They want to build a relationship and  trust you. The only reason why that happened because the first year, it went from  this particular individual start off as a very, very small, like couple of thousand of  dollar a month customer, and grew to be like a $50,000-$60,000 a month customer, very,  very large in a short period of time. We did a lot.

我想我意识到的第一件事是顾客不会突然开始把他们介绍给你。他们想建立一种关系并信任你。之所以会发生这种情况，是因为第一年，它从一个非常小的个体开始，就像一个月几千美元的客户，并且在很短的时间内发展成一个每月5万到6万美元的客户，非常大。我们做了很多。

In a lot  of things, we were very transparent. "Hey, we can't get this done in this timeframe.  Here's what we can do." I had a cell phone number. We frequently text when  things go wrong. For us, I think the biggest reason why he actually went and  referred us is because of how we handled things when things didn't go the way  we planned. Everybody wants projects to go perfectly, launch on time. The reality is it  doesn't always happen that way. Sometimes there's factors out of your control.

在很多事情上，我们是非常透明的。“嘿，我们不能在这个时间框架内完成这件事。我们可以这样做。”我有个手机号码。当事情出错时，我们经常发短信。对我们来说，我认为他之所以真的去介绍我们，最大的原因是我们如何处理事情，而事情并没有按我们计划的方式进行。每个人都希望项目顺利进行，按时启动。事实是，事情并不总是这样发生的。有时候有些因素是你无法控制的。

I think the  way that we handled ourselves when things didn't go planned was a huge vote in  confidence, like "This is a company that we can trust" because we're watching people scramble.  I remember there's one instance around Christmas. Some deliveries didn't happen for key customers. We  went out and drove out and just like delivered it.

我认为，当事情没有按计划进行时，我们处理自己的方式是一次巨大的信心投票，就像“这是一家我们可以信任的公司”，因为我们看着人们争先恐后。我记得圣诞节前后有一个例子。一些主要客户没有送货。我们出去开车出去，就像送货一样。

I was like, "Yeah, the  guy's like down the street.

我说，“是啊，这家伙就像在街上一样。

It's not big deal. We'll just go get it done."  He was hugely appreciative. That was a small thing and it was a very small  campaign that he was doing, but the stories like that that he clings on to  when he goes to a new company and is like, "The reason why I worked  with these guys is 'cause they did all this for us. When things were not  going well, they still stepped up and did the right thing." That's why they love  us today.

没什么大不了的。我们去把这件事做完。“他非常感激。这是一件很小的事情，也是他正在做的一场很小的运动，但是当他去一家新公司的时候，他一直坚持这样的故事，他说，“我和这些家伙一起工作的原因是因为他们为我们做了这一切。”当事情不顺利的时候，他们还是站了起来，做了正确的事情。“所以他们今天才爱我们。

I think it starts with having your product.

我想这是从你的产品开始的。

If your product's not good,  no matter what you do for the customer is probably not going to take you  because then he's putting his job at risk.
